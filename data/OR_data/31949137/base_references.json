            "abstract": "Different regimens for vaccination against influenza and tuberculosis were compared on the basis of experiments with Guinea-pigs and rabbits and observations of human volunteers. Influenza vaccines (live and inactivated) and BCG were given separately and simultaneously. No unfavourable influence of these vaccines upon one another was observed. Clinic and laboratory indices of vaccine efficacy under both conditions were identical. BCG did not influence the postvaccination virus shedding of a live influenza vaccine. The immunogenicity of influenza vaccines given simultaneously with BCG appeared to be improved. The evaluation of live and inactivated influenza vaccines under different schemes show that the inactivated influenza vaccine (AGH) has greater immunogenicity. The distinction was also evident in evaluations of vaccine efficacy in animals after challenge with pathogenic influenza virus. These findings indicate that the simultaneous application of influenza and tuberculosis vaccines should be further investigated."

The rats of the experimental group have demonstrated more rapid debridement of the wound from blood clots and tissue detritus, intensive formation of granular tissue and its ripening. The experimental investigation has shown that using the preparation of systemic enzymotherapy (Vobenzyme) stimulates processes of healing at the expense of quicker changing the inflammation phases as well as prevents the development of early and late complications on the side of postoperative wounds. It was confirmed by clinical observations in 36 patients from 4 to 14 years of age."

            "abstract": "Aluminum in the form of aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate or alum has been commonly used as an adjuvant in many vaccines licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chapter 21 of the US Code of Federal Regulations [610.15(a)] limits the amount of aluminum in biological products, including vaccines, to 0.85 mg/dose. The amount of aluminum in vaccines currently licensed in the US ranges from 0.85-0.125 mg/dose. Clinical studies have demonstrated that aluminum enhances the antigenicity of some vaccines such as diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. Moreover, aluminum-adsorbed diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are distinctly more effective than plain fluid toxoids for primary immunization of children. There is little difference between plain and adsorbed toxoids for booster immunization. Aluminum adjuvants have a demonstrated safety profile of over six decades; however, these adjuvants have been associated with severe local reactions such as erythema, subcutaneous nodules and contact hypersensitivity."

Clinical and laboratorial evaluations revealed that JDM scores and muscle enzymes remained stable throughout the study (p>0.05). A higher frequency of chronic course was observed in non-seroconverted compared to seroconverted (100% vs. 27%, p=0.012). Regarding treatment, a lower rate of seroconversion was observed in patients under prednisone>20mg/day (50% vs. 4%, p=0.039), and in those treated with a combination of prednisone, methotrexate and cyclosporine (50% vs. 4%, p=0.039).

The total trial period was 165 days. In addition to evaluating the number of tonsillitis recurrences which occurred during the 75 days of treatment and the 90-day follow-up period, the number of days on which the principal symptoms of the illness were present and on which drugs such as antibiotics or anti-inflammatory agents were used concomitantly, as well as the number of days' absence from school, were analyzed. The findings showed that, taking the treatment phase and the three-month follow-up period together, pidotimod significantly reduces the incidence of inflammatory upper airways episodes. The very low incidence of adverse effects, which was the same as that in the placebo group, confirmed the excellent safety of the product."

Recent advances in parasite immunology and cell biology have been utilized to improve peptide design and adjuvant formulations. The clinical trials demonstrated the potential of second generation peptide vaccines to elicit antibodies that can neutralize sporozoite infectivity and cooperate with monocytes in ADCI to inhibit blood stage parasites. In addition, peptide-induced malaria-specific human CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were shown in vitro to have similar fine specificity and function as parasite-induced T cells. The results of these clinical trials, while encouraging, have emphasized the critical roles of immunological assays, in particular functional assays, for the evaluation of potential vaccine candidates. Additional challenges include the need for potent adjuvants for the development of synthetic peptide vaccines that can effectively target multiple stages of the Plasmodium parasite."

By contrast, many alternative adjuvanted vaccines have failed to progress. The key decisions that allowed MF59 to succeed in such a challenging environment are highlighted here and the lessons that were learned along the way are discussed. MF59 was connected to vaccines that did not succeed and was perceived as a 'failure' before it was a success. Importantly, it never failed for safety reasons and was always well tolerated. Even when safety issues have emerged for alternative adjuvants, careful analysis of the substantial safety database for MF59 have shown that there are no significant concerns with widespread use, even in more 'sensitive' populations."

While developing vaccines that target specific infection, molecular adjuvants are indispensable. These molecular adjuvants act as a vaccine delivery vehicle to the immune system to increase the effectiveness of the specific antigens. In the present work, a computational study has been done on molecular adjuvants like IgGFc, GMCSF and C3d to find out how efficiently they are binding to CR1. Sequence, structure and mutational analysis are performed on the molecular adjuvants to understand the features important for their binding with the receptor. Results obtained from our study indicate that the adjuvant IgGFc complexed with the receptor CR1 has the best binding efficiency, which can be used further to develop better vaccine technologies."

Whether the differences are due to vaccine composition or other factors such as the timing of large-scale vaccination programs relative to H1N1pdm09 wild-type virus circulation in different geographic regions is not clear. The limitations of retrospective observational methodologies could also be contributing to some of the differences across studies. More basic and epidemiologic research is needed to further elucidate the association between adjuvanted influenza vaccine and narcolepsy and its mechanism and to inform planning and preparation for vaccination programs in advance of the next influenza pandemic."

Determinants of vaccination uptake and its impact on health outcomes in the seasons 2014/2015-2016/2017 in elderly living in Treviso area (Veneto Region, North-Eastern Italy) were evaluated. A retrospective cohort study was conducted combining information from several health administrative databases, and multiple Poisson regression models were applied to evaluate the influenza vaccine effectiveness, also adjusting for confounding factors. MF59-adjuvanted trivalent-inactivated vaccine was mainly administered. Data from more than 83,000 elderly people were analyzed by year. Vaccine coverage was about 50%; influenza vaccination uptake was independently associated with older age, male sex, increasing number of underlying chronic conditions, previous pneumococcal vaccination, annual expenses for specialist medical cares, and general practitioner to whom the elderly was in charge. After adjusting for previously described characteristics, vaccination was associated with lower mortality and influenza-related hospitalization rates. Specifically, during influenza season the adjusted incidence rate ratio of death and of influenza-related hospitalizations for vaccinated compared to unvaccinated persons was 0.63 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-0.69, p < .001] and 0.86 (95% CI 0.81-0.91, p < .001), respectively. A similar effectiveness was estimated for death in all age groups (≤74, 75-84, ≥85 years old), whereas a higher effect was found for hospitalizations in subjects aged ≥75 years old. Vaccination was also effective both in males and females. Findings suggest a health benefit of the influenza vaccination in the elderly population.

We demonstrate that synergy between the two adjuvant components is observed after their incorporation with H1N1 vaccine into MNPs as revealed by analysis of the immune responses in adult mice. Aged 21-month-old mice were found to be completely protected against live influenza challenge after vaccination with the MNPs adjuvanted with the Quil-A/cGAMP combination (5 µg each) and demonstrated significantly reduced morbidity compared to the observed responses in these mice vaccinated with unadjuvanted MNPs.

            "abstract": "Conventional corticosteroid therapy effectively induces remission of Crohn's disease (CD) across a range of disease severity. However, alternative treatments are needed for patients with disease unresponsive to corticosteroids, patients requiring maintenance therapy (for which corticosteroids are ineffective), corticosteroid-dependent patients, and patients with corticosteroid-related toxicities. Thus, corticosteroid-sparing effects are an important clinical endpoint for treatments of CD. Budesonide offers comparable efficacy with less short-term toxicity than conventional corticosteroids (prednisone, prednisolone); this agent has also demonstrated short-term remission maintenance efficacy, while potentially enabling withdrawal of more toxic corticosteroids in corticosteroid-dependent patients. However, budesonide has not shown long-term maintenance benefit in clinical studies, and the risk for and implications of budesonide dependency need further evaluation. The immunomodulators, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, are most effective for maintenance of remission in quiescent disease, but may be useful in conjunction with other therapies in inducing remission in active CD; methotrexate may be considered an alternative because of its efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission. In clinical trials, treatment with azathioprine/6-methotrexate has enabled corticosteroid withdrawal in 55% of patients, and methotrexate, in 39% of patients with corticosteroid-dependent CD, while maintaining clinical response. Monitoring for infrequent hematological or hepatic toxicity is recommended during use of these immunomodulators. Infliximab is effective for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with refractory CD participating in randomized placebo-controlled studies and, in open-label experience, has enabled corticosteroid withdrawal in approximately three quarters of patients. This biological agent is generally well tolerated. Infusion reactions are the most commonly occurring side effects; such reactions may require adjustment of infusion rate and/or treatment with an antihistamine or acetaminophen. The investigational biological agent CDP-571 has also shown corticosteroid-sparing efficacy in patients with CD. In conclusion, recent research has helped identify corticosteroid-sparing treatments that can provide benefit in patients with corticosteroid-dependent and/or corticosteroid-refractory CD or patients at risk for corticosteroid-induced toxicities."

            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare both the safety and tolerability and the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses for two influenza virus subunit vaccines, one with MF59 adjuvant (Fluad) and one without an adjuvant (Agrippal), in healthy and in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected adult individuals. To achieve this aim, an open, randomized, comparative clinical trial was performed during the 2005-2006 season. A total of 256 subjects were enrolled to receive one dose of vaccine intramuscularly. Blood samples were taken at the time of vaccination and at 1 and 3 months postvaccination. A good humoral antibody response was detected for both vaccines, meeting all the criteria of the Committee for Medical Products for Human Use. After Beyer's correction for prevaccination status, Fluad exhibited better immunogenicity than Agrippal, as shown from the analysis of the geometric mean titers, with significant differences for some virus strains; however, no definitive conclusions on the clinical significance of such results can be drawn, because the method used to estimate antibody response is currently nonstandard for influenza virus vaccines. Significant induction of an antigen-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte proliferative response was detected at all time points after immunization, for both the vaccines, among HIV-1-seronegative subjects. This was different from what was observed for HIV-1-infected individuals. In this group, significance was not reached at 30 days postvaccination (T30) for those immunized with Agrippal. Also when data were compared between treatment groups, a clear difference in the response at T30 was observed in favor of Fluad (P = 0.0002). The safety profiles of both vaccines were excellent. For HIV-1-infected individuals, no significant changes either in viremia or in the CD4+ cell count were observed at any time point. The results showed good safety and immunogenicity for both vaccines under study for both uninfected and HIV-1-infected adults, confirming current recommendations for immunization of this high-risk category."

Controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy of this drug in trigeminal neuralgia. Although its precise mechanism of analgesic action is unknown, it is likely that a drug-induced increase in inhibitory activity is sufficient to interrupt the cascade of neural events that culminates in aberrant activity of wide dynamic range neurons, or more rostral neurons in nociceptive pathways, that is the substrate for some types of neuropathic pain. The optimal use of baclofen as an adjuvant analgesic requires an understanding of its pharmacology, side effect spectrum, and dosing guidelines that have proven useful in clinical practice.

With 12,500 deaths in the United States in 2009-2010, the influenza (H1N1) 2009 pandemic was actually less deadly than the seasonal flu. But it essentially hit the young, and the toll calculated in years of life lost is high. The monovalent vaccines, whether live attenuated or inactivated with or without adjuvants, were well tolerated in toddlers, children, adults and pregnant women. In order to protect infants against pertussis, family members are urged to get their booster shots. The introduction of the 13-valent Pneumococcal conjugated vaccine in the beginning of 2010 may solve - but for how long ? - the problem of serotype replacement, responsible for the re-increasing incidence of invasive Pneumococcal infections observed in countries that had introduced the 7-valent vaccine. The efficacy of a rotavirus vaccine has been confirmed, with a reduction in hospitalization in the United States and a reduction in gastroenteritis-related deaths in Mexico. In the United States, vaccination of pre-adolescents against human papillomavirus (HPV) has not resulted in any specific undesirable effects. Routine vaccination against chicken pox, recommended since 1995, has not had an impact on the evolution of the incidence of shingles. Vaccination against shingles, recommended in the United States for subjects 60 years and over, shows an effectiveness of 55 %, according to a cohort study (Kaiser Permanente, Southern California). Although some propose the development of personalized vaccines according to individual genetic characteristics, the priority remains with increasing vaccine coverage, not only in infants but also in adults and the elderly. Vaccine calendars that cover a whole lifetime should be promoted, since the vaccination of adults and seniors is a determining factor of good health at all ages."

The primary immunological outcomes were the proportion of participants with a 4-fold or greater increase in antibodies and geometric mean antibody titres after vaccination; the proportion of participants reporting adverse events during therapy was the safety outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 117 (94%) participants completed all aspects of the study. There were no differences in the proportions of recipients of 200 or 400 mg of the Chlorella-derived dietary supplement or placebo who achieved at least a 4-fold increase in antibodies (proportions for the 3 virus strains ranged from 17.9% to 28.2% for the 200-mg group, from 11.1% to 22.2% for the 400-mg group and from 19.0% to 21.4% for the placebo group; p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Reports of adverse events were similar for recipients of the supplement and placebo, except with regard to fatigue, which was reported more frequently by recipients of 200 mg of the supplement (18/41 or 44%) than by those who received 400 mg of the supplement (8/40 or 20%; p = 0.032) or placebo (8/42 or 19%; p = 0.019). Recipients of 400 mg of the supplement who were 55 years of age or younger had significantly higher geometric mean antibody titres against influenza A/New Caledonia 21 days after vaccination (p = 0.047) and against B/Yamanashi 7 days after vaccination (p = 0.034); the trends were nonsignificant for titres against A/Panama. We also observed similar increases for the proportions of subjects with a 2-fold or greater or a 4-fold or greater increase in antibodies.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      The Chlorella-derived dietary supplement did not have any effect in increasing the antibody response to influenza vaccine in the overall study population, although there was an increase in antibody response among participants aged 50-55 years. Adverse events were similar among those receiving the supplement and the placebo. Further studies are warranted to explore the range of clinical effects resulting from ingestion of this dietary supplement."

            "abstract": "The immunomodulator glucan exists in two forms, particulate (glucan-P) and soluble (glucan-F). Both preparations of glucan, either alone or in combination with antibiotic therapy, were evaluated for their ability to augment survival in rats following cecal ligation and puncture (CL/P). Adult male rats were infused once daily for 5 consecutive days with either glucan-P (10 mg/kg), glucan-F (10 mg/kg), or 5% (w/v) dextrose in water. Three days later all rats underwent CL/P. Postoperatively, the rats received (a) no therapy, (b) saline (1 ml subcutaneously every 12 hr) or (c) ampicillin (33 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hr) for 7 days. Without any associated pre-or postoperative treatment, CL/P was associated with an 85% 7-day mortality. Neither glucan preparation alone significantly altered this mortality. Administering ampicillin postoperatively decreased the mortality to 53% (P less than 0.001 vs untreated controls). When postoperative ampicillin therapy was combined with preoperative glucan treatment, the mortality was reduced even further (26% for glucan-P, 21% for glucan-F; P less than 0.02 vs ampicillin-treated controls). We conclude from these results that (i) neither glucan preparation alone effectively enhances survival following CL/P when using the doses and administration schedule employed herein, (ii) both glucan-P and glucan-F do act synergistically with antibiotics to enhance survival in this rat model of polymicrobial sepsis, and (iii) in this particular model, nontoxic glucan-F is as efficacious as glucan-P."

In this review, we highlight recent experimental and clinical evidences of potential coadjuvants in the management of DM, such as polyphenols (quercetin, resveratrol and silymarin), cultured probiotic microorganisms and drugs acting through direct/indirect or pleiotropic effects on glycemic control in DM. Among several options, we highlight new promising therapeutic coadjuvants, including chemical scavengers, the probiotic kefir and the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, which besides the reduction of hyperglycemia and ameliorate insulin resistance, they reduce oxidative stress and improve endothelial dysfunction in the systemic vascular circulation. In the near future, experimental studies are expected to clear the intracellular pathways involving coadjuvants. The design of clinical trials may also contribute to new strategies with coadjuvants against the harmful effects of diabetic complications."

Despite the central role of Tfh cells in vaccine responses, there is currently no validated way to enhance their differentiation in humans. From paired human lymph node and blood samples, we identify a population of circulating Tfh cells that are transcriptionally and clonally similar to germinal center Tfh cells. In a clinical trial of vaccine formulations, circulating Tfh cells were expanded in Tanzanian volunteers when an experimental malaria vaccine was adjuvanted in GLA-SE but not when formulated in Alum. The GLA-SE-formulated peptide was associated with an increase in the extrafollicular antibody response, long-lived antibody production, and the emergence of public TCRβ clonotypes in circulating Tfh cells. We demonstrate that altering vaccine adjuvants is a rational approach for enhancing Tfh cells in humans, thereby supporting the long-lived humoral immunity that is required for effective vaccines."

Despite almost 90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science's understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor. There is also a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and pharmacokinetics of these compounds. In spite of this, the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted. Experimental research, however, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences. In our opinion, the possibility that vaccine benefits may have been overrated and the risk of potential adverse effects underestimated, has not been rigorously evaluated in the medical and scientific community. We hope that the present paper will provide a framework for a much needed and long overdue assessment of this highly contentious medical issue."

The vaccine strain was made by reverse genetics from the highly pathogenic avian A/Chicken/Astana/6/05 (H5N1) clade 2.2 strain isolated from a dead bird in Kazakhstan. The humoral immune response was evaluated after a single vaccination by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays. The vaccine was safe and immunogenic, inducing seroconversion in 55% of the evaluated patients, with a geometric mean titer (GMT) of 17.1 and a geometric mean increase (GMI) of 3.42 after a dose of 7.5 μg in the HI test against the vaccine strain. The rate of seroconversion increased up to 70% when the dose of 15 μg was used. The percentages of individuals achieving anti-HA titers of ≥1:40 were 52.5% and 57.5% for the 7.5- and 15-μg dose groups, respectively. Similar results were obtained when antibodies were analyzed in an MN test. Substantial cross-neutralization titers (seroconversion in 35% and 52.5% of subjects in the two dose groups, respectively) were detected against heterologous clade 1 strain NIBRG14 (H5N1). Thus, one dose of this whole-virion prepandemic vaccine adjuvanted with aluminum has the potential to be effective against H5N1 viruses of different clades."

Breaking out after months or years of therapy with a certain drug, its occurrence is likely to increase with the duration of the medication and the cumulative quantity of the drug. The symptoms of this syndrome include, in particular, arthralgia, myalgia, fever, serositis, skin exanthema and production of antinuclear (ANA) antibodies. In contrast to SLE, its symptoms gradually abate after discontinuation of the inducing agent.

Significant improvement of five among nine clinical criteria were obtained with thymopentin after the third week of treatment. The response rate (improvement of a clinical parameter by at least 40%) was significantly greater for all clinical parameters in the thymopentin group. Regression to a functionally more favourable class (Steinbrocker's classification) occurred in seven thymopentin-treated, but in none of the placebo-treated patients. The improvement gradually subsided over four weeks after the end of treatment. There were no changes during the trial with respect to immunological, biochemical or haematological findings.

This goal aims to reduce the under-five mortality rate, by two thirds, between 1990 and 2015.Few studies have examined the impact of zinc adjunct therapy on the outcome of childhood pneumonia. We determined the effect of zinc as adjunct therapy on time to normalization of respiratory rate, temperature and oxygen saturation. We also studied the effect of zinc adjunct therapy on case fatality of severe childhood pneumonia (as a secondary outcome) in Mulago Hospital, Uganda.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 352 children aged 6 to 59 months, with severe pneumonia were randomized to zinc (20 mg for children ≥ 12 months, and 10 mg for those < 12 months) or a placebo once daily for seven days, in addition to standard antibiotics for severe pneumonia. Children were assessed every six hours. Oxygen saturation was normal if it was above 92% (breathing room air) for more than 15 minutes. The respiratory rate was normal if it was consistently (more than 24 hours) below 50 breaths per minute in infants and 40 breaths per minute in children above 12 months of age. Temperature was normal if consistently below 37.5°C. The difference in case fatality was expressed by the risk ratio between the two groups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Time to normalization of the respiratory rate, temperature and oxygen saturation was not significantly different between the two arms.Case fatality was 7/176 (4.0%) in the zinc group and 21/176 (11.9%) in the placebo group: Relative Risk 0.33 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.76). Relative Risk Reduction was 0.67 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.85), while the number needed to treat was 13. Among HIV infected children, case fatality was higher in the placebo (7/27) than in the zinc (0/28) group; RR 0.1 (95% CI 0.0, 1.0).Among 127 HIV uninfected children receiving the placebo, case fatality was 7/127 (5.5%); versus 5/129 (3.9%) among HIV uninfected group receiving zinc: RR 0.7 (95% CI 0.2, 2.2). The excess risk of death attributable to the placebo arm (Absolute Risk Reduction or ARR) was 8/100 (95% CI: 2/100, 14/100) children. This excess risk was substantially greater among HIV positive children than in HIV negative children (ARR: 26 (95% CI: 9, 42) per 100 versus 2 (95% CI: -4, 7) per 100); P-value for homogeneity of risk differences = 0.006.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Zinc adjunct therapy for severe pneumonia had no significant effect on time to normalization of the respiratory rate, temperature and oxygen saturation.

Results to month (M) 24 have been reported previously and we now report data to M48 focusing on the licensed vaccine formulation (20 μg each of HPV-16 and -18 antigens) administered at M0,6 compared with the standard 3-dose (3D) schedule (M0,1,6). Healthy females (age stratified: 9-14, 15-19, 20-25 years) were randomized to receive 2D at M0,6 (n = 240) or 3D at M0,1,6 (n = 239). In the according-to-protocol immunogenicity cohort, all initially seronegative subjects seroconverted for HPV-16 and -18 antibodies and remained seropositive up to M48. For both HPV-16 and -18, geometric mean antibody titer (GMT) ratios (3D schedule in women aged 15-25 years divided by 2D schedule in girls aged 9-14 years) at M36 and M48 were close to 1, as they were at M7 when non-inferiority was demonstrated. The kinetics of HPV-16, -18, -31, and -45 antibody responses were similar for both groups and HPV-16 and -18 GMTs were substantially higher than natural infection titers. The vaccine had a clinically acceptable safety profile in both groups. In summary, antibody responses to a 2D M0,6 schedule of the licensed vaccine formulation in girls aged 9-14 years appeared comparable to the standard 3D schedule in women aged 15-25 years up to 4 years after first vaccination. A 2D schedule could facilitate implementation of HPV vaccination programs and improve vaccine coverage and series completion rates."

Private partners (vaccine manufacturers from the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Association (EFPIA)) provide written feedback moderated by an independent scientific committee. Test-negative design (TND) case-control studies (4 in primary care and five in hospital) were conducted in six countries in Europe during the 2018/19 season. Site-specific confounder-adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates for any vaccine exposure were calculated by age group (<18 years (y), 18-64y and 65 + y) and pooled by setting (primary care, hospital) through random effects meta-analysis. In addition, one population-based cohort study was conducted in Finland. TND studies included 3339 cases and 6012 controls; seven vaccine brands were reported. For ages 65 + y, pooled VE against any influenza strain was estimated at 27% (95%CI 6-44) in hospital setting. Sample size was insufficient for meaningful IVE estimates in other age groups, in the primary care setting, or by vaccine brand. The population-based cohort study included 274,077 vaccinated and 494,337 unvaccinated person-years, two vaccine brands were reported. Brand-specific IVE was estimated for Fluenz Tetra (36% [95%CI 24-45]) for ages 2-6y, Vaxigrip Tetra (54% [43-62]) for ages 6 months to 6y, and Vaxigrip Tetra (30% [25-35]) for ages 65 + y. The results presented are from the second influenza season covered by the DRIVE network. While sample size from the pooled TND studies was still too low for precise (brand-specific) IVE estimates, the network has approximately doubled in size compared to the pilot season.

Gross intra-abdominal lesions were only examined at 12 and 25 weeks. The results show that the onset of inflammation in all vaccinated groups was rapid to develop, with intense cellular infiltrations predominated by mononuclear cells especially in groups injected by oil-based vaccines. Inflammation induced by AVM and liposome vaccines resolved within 12 weeks. In contrast, oil-adjuvanted vaccines produced mild, persistent but ultimately decreasing reactions. Persistent antigens were observed in oil-based and liposome vaccines. The results show that the cod inflammatory response is similar to other bony fish species. The findings also suggest that cod has an efficient innate immune system that is able to rapidly remove or sequester antigens from the injection site leading to the down-regulation of inflammation. Oil-adjuvanted vaccines appear to be well-tolerated by this species and show promise as a possible approach for disease control."

Seroprotection rates after administration of the monovalent vaccine reached 93% and 98% in the adult groups, and 83.7% in the elderly group. After administration of the trivalent vaccine, seroprotection rates of 92.2% and 81.3% were obtained respectively in the adult and the elderly groups.

Subjects were administered 10 verbal memory tests from the Memory Assessment Scales and the Verbal subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Analysis showed subjects treated with Betaseron (n = 73) did not perform significantly better on measures of verbal memory or verbal ability than subjects not receiving the drug (n = 94), although the mean performance of treated subjects was higher across all verbal memory tests. Both groups of patients performed significantly worse on verbal memory subtests measuring list acquisition, delayed list recall, delayed cued recall, and the immediate and delayed recall of names and faces than control subjects. Although patients had lower performance scores across all memory tests than the control subjects, their scores were not within the impaired range. These results do not permit a clear conclusion about the effects of Betaseron on verbal memory for any effect is probably obscured by the relatively preserved cognitive functioning of this outpatient sample."

            "abstract": "Acute encephalomyelitis in children refers to an insult of cortical white matter leading to acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, insult of the spinal cord leading to multifocal myelopathy, or a combined form of encephalomyelitis. We report here the clinical presentations and outcome of 16 children with severe acute encephalomyelitis analyzing the effect of high-dose methylprednisolone or intravenous immunoglobulins, administered separately or in combination. Five children developed acute disseminated encephalomyelitis alone, eight developed severe multifocal myelopathy accompanied in two of them by radiculoneuropathy, and three developed the most severe form of combined encephalomyeloradiculoneuropathy. The indications for treatment with either high-dose methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, or a combination of the two were severe acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, visual loss, or severe flaccid weakness accompanied by bladder and bowel incontinence. Overall, 10 children had remarkably responded to high-dose methylprednisolone alone and recovered within 10 days. One patient with severe myelopath, developing paraplegia, who failed oral corticosteroids completely recovered following intravenous immunoglobulin. Of the isolated acute disseminated encephalomyelitis group, all patients were initially treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone and recovered within 10 days, including visual remission in the child with severe optic neuritis. All six children with solitary severe multifocal myelopathy were treated with high-dose methylprednisolone alone and recovered within the first week. Two patients had severe myeloradiculoneuropathy and were therefore treated with combined high-dose methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin: one remains paraplegic, whereas the second was ventilated for 3 weeks and recovered after 2 months. The three children with the most severe form of encephalomyeloradiculoneuropathy were treated with combined high-dose methylprednisolone and intravenous immununoglobulin; two remain severely handicapped, of whom one is paraplegic, and the third unexpectedly recovered within 3 months. Therefore, our experience indicates that either high-dose methylprednisolone or intravenous immunoglobulin, given separately or combined, may be efficacious in severe debilitating pediatric-onset acute encephalomyelitis. In children with the most severe form of encephalomyeloradiculoneuropathy, we suggest initially administering high-dose methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin combined, given the poorer outcome of our patients with combined severe central and peripheral demyelination."

            "abstract": "The use of adjuvants is one approach to improve influenza vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy, particularly in aged populations. The response of BALB/c mice to subcutaneously administered formalin-inactivated whole influenza virus vaccine in the presence or absence of a nonionic block copolymer adjuvant CRL1005 was evaluated. In young adult naïve mice, the copolymer adjuvant significantly enhanced virus-specific IgG and hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody responses and augmented the production of IL-2 following vaccination. Influenza vaccine formulated with 2.5 mg CRL1005 significantly enhanced the protective efficacy of the inactivated vaccine in the upper and lower respiratory tract. In mice previously infected with influenza virus or naïve aged mice, inactivated vaccine administered with the copolymer adjuvant substantially enhanced the serum HI antibody response to inactivated influenza vaccine and significantly reduced lung virus titers following subsequent challenge with live virus compared with mice administered vaccine alone. These results suggest that the copolymer adjuvant warrants further investigation as a potential adjuvant for use in human vaccination against influenza."

Retrospective studies have demonstrated that preventing this pathoadaptation by improving eradication is essential to extend the lives of CF patients. To identify adjuvants that enhance tobramycin eradication of P. aeruginosa, we performed a high-throughput screen of 6,080 compounds from four drug-repurposing libraries. We identified that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compound triclosan, in combination with tobramycin, resulted in a 100-fold reduction of viable cells within biofilms at 6 h, but neither compound alone had significant antimicrobial activity against biofilms. This synergistic treatment significantly accelerated the killing of biofilms compared to that with tobramycin treatment alone, and the combination was effective against 6/7 CF clinical isolates compared to tobramycin treatment alone, including a tobramycin-resistant strain. Further, triclosan and tobramycin killed persister cells, causing a 100-fold reduction by 8 h and complete eradication by 24 h. Triclosan also enhances tobramycin killing of multiple Burkholderia cenocepacia and Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates grown as biofilms. Additionally, triclosan showed synergy with other aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin or streptomycin. Triclosan is a well-tolerated aminoglycoside adjuvant shown to be safe for human use that could improve the treatment of biofilm-based infections."

Thus, QT-0101 was used as a vaccine adjuvant to modulate the immune system against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35-55) antigen.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this study, C57BL/6 mice, except for mice in the negative control (PBS) and MOG groups, were divided into three groups and immunized by MOG35-55 emulsified with CFA, QS-21, or QT-0101 adjuvants, respectively. Thermal hyperalgesia, as a CNP clinical manifestation, through the Hot Plate test and the clinical signs, was assessed for 60 days after immunization. On days 21 and 60, mice were sacrificed and the frequency of TCD4+, TCD8+, IL-17+, IL-4+, and CD25+/FoxP3+ cells population in the total splenocytes population was assessed by flow cytometry. Infiltration of Leukocytes into the brain and demyelination of white matter were also evaluated by histopathologic studies.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Our results revealed that unlike the MOG+QT-0101 group, the MOG+QS-21 and MOG+CFA groups represented clinical symptoms that mimic the mild relapsing-remitting and monophasic models, respectively. Thermal hyperalgesia, as a CNP clinical manifestation, developed in the bilateral hind paws in the MOG+CFA and MOG+QS-21 mice groups during the onset of neurologic deficits, but it is maintained until completion of the study only in MOG+QS-21 mice group. The frequency of TCD4+, TCD8+ and IL-17+ cells population in the MOG+QS-21 and MOG+CFA mice groups, as well as IL-4+ and CD25+/Foxp3+ cells population in the MOG+QT-0101 mice group, significantly increased in comparison with the PBS mice group. Infiltration of inflammatory cells increased significantly in the MOG+QS-21 and MOG+CFA mice groups compared with the PBS mice group. Demyelination of white matter was identified significantly only in the MOG+CFA mice group compared with the PBS mice group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These results showed that QS-21 is a suitable adjuvant for the establishment of a mild relapsing-remitting EAE model for CNP development and open a new avenue to future pre-clinical and clinical research studies related to CNP treatment. Nevertheless, QT-0101 seems to have the potential to act as a vaccine adjuvant with immunomodulatory property against auto-antigens."

One or two doses, 15 μg or 30 μg, were given either once only or twice 14 days apart (1 x 30 μg, 2 x 30 μg, 2 x 15 μg) and subjects were challenged with A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) virus.

These factors were also significantly associated with any ALE but the strength of association was weaker. Allergy to components found in the vaccine (e.g., egg, thimerosal) was infrequent and did not significantly differ between cases and controls.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Increased anaphylaxis and other allergic-like events observed in association with AS03-adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 vaccine remain mostly unexplained despite extensive risk factor review. However, prior to mass vaccination with similar formulations this safety signal warrants further consideration and better understanding. In particular, the predominance among women of childbearing age may be a clue to underlying biological or hormonal influences on adverse immunological responses to vaccine."

Such adverse effects on the gastric mucosa have recently been found to occur with even greater frequency in certain NSAID-treated patients. Synthetic prostaglandin analogues have been shown to be cytoprotective of the gastric mucosa. This benefit has been evidenced by the reduced risk of gastric ulceration and gastric bleeding in patients taking NSAIDs on a prolonged basis. The first synthetic prostaglandin to be approved for this indication is misoprostol (Cytotec). To determine which and how many patients receiving NSAIDs should be treated adjunctively with a cytoprotective prostaglandin to reduce risk of NSAID-induced gastropathy, a clinical study of 100 consecutive patients seen in a rheumatology practice was undertaken. Patients were assessed by interview and chart review. Of these patients, 19% to 30% were considered potential candidates for adjunctive prostaglandin therapy. The rationale for use of the \"gastroprotective\" prostaglandins appears to lie in the identification of those patients who are especially at high risk for gastric ulcers."

Corneal blocks from rabbit eyes were cultured for 20 hours with hyaluronan in different concentrations and molecular weight ranges. In another experiment, the corneal epithelium was denuded and hyaluronan was administered as eye drops. Distances of epithelial migration increased over exposed stroma proportionally to concentration, when hyaluronan was added with a molecular weight of 800-1,400 kD. Maximum effect was observed with 0.2% hyaluronan concentration. No difference was seen when corneal blocks were cultured with hyaluronan 0.2% in different molecular weight ranges (800-1,400, 1,400-2,000, and 2,000-2,600 kD). When hyaluronan (molecular weight, 800-1,400 kD) eye drops were administered after corneal epithelial denudation in rabbits, it was found to have faster wound reparation. This effect was concentration-dependent. The 2 highest concentrations (0.2% and 0.4%) were not different for the time needed to complete wound healing. In conclusion, hyaluronan-induced stimulation of corneal wound healing fulfills standards for being considered as a pharmacological effect."

Given the background incidence of autoimmune disorders in some of the groups targeted for immunisation with these vaccines, it is likely that autoimmune events will be reported in temporal association with vaccination, even in the absence of a causal relationship. The objective of this integrated analysis was to assess safety of AS04 adjuvanted vaccines with regard to adverse events (AEs) of potential autoimmune aetiology, particularly in adolescents and young adults. All randomised, controlled trials of HPV-16/18, HSV and HBV vaccines were analysed in an integrated analysis of individual data (N = 68,512). A separate analysis of the HPV-16/18 vaccine trials alone was also undertaken (N = 39,160). All data were collected prospectively during the vaccine development programmes (mean follow-up of 21.4 months), and included in the analysis up to a pre-defined data lock point. Reporting rates of overall autoimmune events were around 0.5% and did not differ between the AS04 and control groups. The relative risk (AS04/control) of experiencing any autoimmune event was 0.98 (95% confidence intervals 0.80, 1.21) in the integrated analysis and 0.92 (0.70, 1.22) in the HPV-16/18 vaccine analysis. Relative risks calculated overall, for disease category or for individual events were close to 1, and all confidence intervals around the relative risk included 1, indicating no statistically significant difference in event rates between the AS04 and control groups. This integrated analysis of over 68,000 participants who received AS04 adjuvanted vaccines or controls demonstrated a low rate of autoimmune disorders, without evidence of an increase in relative risk associated with AS04 adjuvanted vaccines."

            "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      Effective vaccines against the highly pathogenic influenza A/H5N1 virus are being developed worldwide. In Japan, two adjuvanted, inactivated, whole-virion influenza vaccines were recently developed and licensed as mock-up, pre-pandemic vaccine formulations by the Ministry of Health and Labor Welfare of Japan. During the vaccine design and development process, various obstacles were overcome and, in this report, we introduce the non clinical production, immunogenicity data in human and development process that was associated with egg-derived adjuvanted, inactivated, whole-virion influenza A (H5N1) vaccine.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      Pilot lots of H5N1 vaccine were produced using the avirulent H5N1 reference strain A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) NIBRG-14 and administered following adsorption with aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. Quality control and formulation stability tests were performed before clinical trials were initiated (phase I-III). The research foundation for microbial diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN) carried out vaccine production, quality control, stability testing and the phase I clinical trial in addition to overseeing the licensing of this vaccine. Mitsubishi Chemical Safety Institute Ltd. carried out the non clinical pharmacological toxicity and safety studies and the Japanese medical association carried out the phase II/III trials. Phase I-III trials took place in 2006.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The production processes were well controlled by established tests and validations. Vaccine quality was confirmed by quality control, stability and pre-clinical tests, and the vaccine was approved as a mock-up, pre-pandemic vaccine by the Ministry of Health and Labor Welfare of Japan.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Numerous safety and efficacy procedures were carried out prior to the approval of the described vaccine formulation. Some of these procedures were of particular importance e.g., vaccine development, validation, and quality control tests that included strict monitoring of the hemagglutinin (HA) content of the vaccine formulations. Improving vaccine productivity, shortening the production period and improving antigen yield of the avirulent vaccine strains were also considered important vaccine development criteria."

            "abstract": "This report updates the 2017-18 recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines in the United States (MMWR Recomm Rep 2017;66[No. RR-2]). Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. A licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate vaccine should be used. Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) are expected to be available for the 2018-19 season. Standard-dose, unadjuvanted, inactivated influenza vaccines will be available in quadrivalent (IIV4) and trivalent (IIV3) formulations. Recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) will be available in quadrivalent formulations. High-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) and adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3) will be available in trivalent formulations.Updates to the recommendations described in this report reflect discussions during public meetings of ACIP held on October 25, 2017; February 21, 2018; and June 20, 2018. New and updated information in this report includes the following four items. First, vaccine viruses included in the 2018-19 U.S. trivalent influenza vaccines will be an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus (Victoria lineage). Quadrivalent influenza vaccines will contain these three viruses and an additional influenza B vaccine virus, a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (Yamagata lineage). Second, recommendations for the use of LAIV4 (FluMist Quadrivalent) have been updated. Following two seasons (2016-17 and 2017-18) during which ACIP recommended that LAIV4 not be used, for the 2018-19 season, vaccination providers may choose to administer any licensed, age-appropriate influenza vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4). LAIV4 is an option for those for whom it is appropriate. Third, persons with a history of egg allergy of any severity may receive any licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate influenza vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4). Additional recommendations concerning vaccination of egg-allergic persons are discussed. Finally, information on recent licensures and labeling changes is discussed, including expansion of the age indication for Afluria Quadrivalent (IIV4) from ≥18 years to ≥5 years and expansion of the age indication for Fluarix Quadrivalent (IIV4), previously licensed for ≥3 years, to ≥6 months.This report focuses on the recommendations for use of vaccines for the prevention and control of influenza during the 2018-19 season in the United States. A Background Document containing further information and a brief summary of these recommendations are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/flu.html.These recommendations apply to U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines used within Food and Drug Administration-licensed indications. Updates and other information are available at CDC's influenza website (https://www.cdc.gov/flu). Vaccination and health care providers should check CDC's influenza website periodically for additional information."

            "abstract": "Appropriate adjuvant selection may be essential to optimize the potency and to tailor the immune response of subunit vaccines. To induce protective responses against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-a highly prevalent childhood pathogen without a licensed vaccine-we previously engineered a pre-fusion-stabilized trimeric RSV F (pre-F) \"DS-Cav1\" immunogen, which induced high titer RSV-neutralizing antibodies, in mice and non-human primates, when formulated with adjuvants Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC:LC), respectively. To assess the impact of different adjuvants, here we formulated RSV F DS-Cav1 with multiple adjuvants and assessed immune responses. Very high RSV-neutralizing antibody responses (19,006 EC50) were observed in naïve mice immunized with 2 doses of DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with Sigma adjuvant system (SAS), an oil-in-water adjuvant, plus Carbopol; high responses (3658-7108) were observed with DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with Alum, SAS alone, Adjuplex, Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC:LC); and moderate responses (1251-2129) were observed with DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with the TLR4 agonist MPLA, Alum plus MPLA or AddaVax. In contrast, DS-Cav1 without adjuvant induced low-level responses (6). A balanced IgG1 and IgG2a (Th2/Th1) immune response was elicited in most of the high to very high response groups (all but Alum and Adjuplex). We also tested the immune response induced by DS-Cav1 in elderly mice with pre-existing DS-Cav1 immunity; we observed that DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with SAS plus Carbopol boosted the response 2-3-fold, whereas DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with alum boosted the response 5-fold. Finally, we tested whether a mixture of ISA 71 VG and Carbopol would enhanced the antibody response in DS-Cav1 immunized calves. While pre-F-stabilized bovine RSV F induced very high titers in mice when adjuvanted with SAS plus Carbopol, the addition of Carbopol to ISA 71 VG did not enhance immune responses in calves. The vaccine response to pre-F-stabilized RSV F is augmented by adjuvant, but the degree of adjuvant-induced enhancement appears to be both context-dependent and species-specific."

            "abstract": "The development of biotech drugs such as peptides and proteins that act in the central nervous system has been significantly impeded by the difficulty of delivering them across the blood-brain barrier. The surface engineering of nanoparticles with lectins opened a novel pathway to the absorption of drugs loaded by biodegradable poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (lactic acid) nanoparticles in the brain following intranasal administration. In the present study, vasoactive intestinal peptide, a neuroprotective peptide, was efficiently incorporated into the poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (lactic acid) nanoparticles modified with wheat germ agglutinin and the biodistribution, brain uptake and neuroprotective effect of the formulation were assessed. The area under the concentration-time curve of intact 125I-vasoactive intestinal peptide in brain of mice following the intranasal administration of 125I-vasoactive intestinal peptide carried by nanoparticles and wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated ones was significantly enlarged by 3.5 approximately 4.7 folds and 5.6 approximately 7.7 folds, respectively, compared with that after intranasal application of 125I-vasoactive intestinal peptide solution. The same improvements in spatial memory in ethylcholine aziridium-treated rats were observed following intranasal administration of 25 microg/kg and 12.5 microg/kg of vasoactive intestinal peptide loaded by unmodified nanoparticles and wheat germ agglutinin-modified nanoparticles, respectively. Distribution profiles of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated nanoparticles in the nasal cavity presented their higher affinity to the olfactory mucosa than to the respiratory one. Inhibition experiment with specific sugars suggested that the interaction between the nasal mucosa and the wheat germ agglutinin-functionalized nanoparticles were due to the immobilization of carbohydrate-binding pockets on the surface of the nanoparticles. The results clearly indicated wheat germ agglutinin-modified nanoparticles might serve as promising carriers especially for biotech drugs such as peptides and proteins."

In this study, we wanted to study some of the effects of shark cartilage on tumor immune response.

Then, we examined its effect on the infiltration of CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) lymphocytes into a murine tumor model. Our fraction was composed of two major proteins with molecular weights (MWs) of about 14 and 15 kDa. This fraction highly increases DTH response against sRBC in mice. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of this fraction to tumor-bearing mice could increase T-cell infiltration into the tumor. Also, there was a significant increase in the CD(4)/CD(8) ratio in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, but no such changes were found in the peripheral blood lymphocytes. According to these results, we suppose that this fraction is a good candidate for further studies in cancer therapy.

This observer-blind, randomized Phase III trial assessed the immunogenicity and safety of the MF59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine FLUAD® (aTIV) and a non-adjuvanted TIV, in healthy children (aged 6 to <72 months) from 3 centers in Mexico, during the 2014-2015 season. The primary objectives were to assess the non-inferiority of aTIV to TIV, measured by geometric mean titers (GMTs), and the safety of aTIV and TIV. Seroconversion was one of several secondary objectives. In total, 287 children were enrolled. The non-inferiority criteria for GMTs and seroconversion were met for aTIV for all 3 vaccine strains. Lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals for all 3 aTIV:TIV vaccine ratios were >2, showing that the immunogenicity of aTIV was superior to that of TIV for all 3 strains. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were experienced more frequently with aTIV than TIV by younger children (aged 6 to <36 months), but were more frequent with TIV than aTIV in older children (aged 36 to <72 months) who had been vaccinated previously. More unsolicited AEs were associated with aTIV than the TIV. All AEs were of mild or moderate severity. No deaths, serious AEs, or AEs leading to premature withdrawal were reported. Overall, aTIV was highly immunogenic and was well tolerated in healthy children 6 to <72 months of age. These results indicate that aTIV may be a beneficial addition to national pediatric vaccination programs.\n"

            "abstract": "Vaccine adjuvants and vaccines may induce autoimmune and inflammatory manifestations in susceptible individuals. To date most human vaccine trials utilize aluminum (Al) adjuvants as placebos despite much evidence showing that Al in vaccine-relevant exposures can be toxic to humans and animals. We sought to evaluate the effects of Al adjuvant and the HPV vaccine Gardasil versus the true placebo on behavioral and inflammatory parameters in female mice. Six-week-old C57BL/6 female mice were injected with either, Gardasil, Gardasil + pertussis toxin (Pt), Al hydroxide, or, vehicle control in amounts equivalent to human exposure. At 7.5 months of age, Gardasil and Al-injected mice spent significantly more time floating in the forced swimming test (FST) in comparison with vehicle-injected mice (Al, p = 0.009; Gardasil, p = 0.025; Gardasil + Pt, p = 0.005). The increase in floating time was already highly significant at 4.5 months of age for the Gardasil and Gardasil + Pt group (p ≤ 0.0001). No significant differences were observed in the number of stairs climbed in the staircase test which measures locomotor activity. These results indicate that differences observed in the FST were unlikely due to locomotor dysfunction, but rather due to depression. Moreover, anti-HPV antibodies from the sera of Gardasil and Gardasil + Pt-injected mice showed cross-reactivity with the mouse brain protein extract. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed microglial activation in the CA1 area of the hippocampus of Gardasil-injected mice. It appears that Gardasil via its Al adjuvant and HPV antigens has the ability to trigger neuroinflammation and autoimmune reactions, further leading to behavioral changes."

            "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease. Dendritic cells (DCs) are one of the most powerful antigen-presenting cells, and they play an important role in RA pathogenesis. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a potent lipid mediator that can regulate the maturation and activation of DCs, but the molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated. In this study, both in vitro and in an RA rat model, we investigated the mechanisms involved by focusing on PGE2-mediated signaling and using a novel anti-inflammatory compound, paeoniflorin-6'-O-benzene sulfonate (CP-25). PGE2 combined with tumor necrosis factor-α promoted DC maturation and activation through EP4-cAMP signaling. Treatment with CP-25 increased the endocytic capacity of DCs induced by PGE2. CP-25 inhibited the potency of DCs induced by the EP4 receptor agonist, CAY10598, to stimulate allogeneic T cells. Consistent with these findings, the CAY10598-induced upregulation of DC surface activation markers and production of IL-23 was significantly inhibited by CP-25 in a concentration-dependent manner. In vivo administration of CP-25 alleviated adjuvant arthritis (AA) in rats through inhibition of DC maturation and activation. Our results indicate that PGE2-EP4-cAMP signal hyperfunction can lead to abnormal activation of DC functions, which correlates with the course of disease in AA rats and provides a possible treatment target. The inhibition of DC maturation and activation by CP-25 interference of the PGE2-EP4 pathway may significantly contribute to the immunoregulatory profile of CP-25 when used to treat RA and other immune cell-mediated disorders."

Therefore, we aimed to assess the relative efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of an MF59-adjuvanted, quadrivalent, inactivated (subunit) influenza vaccine (aIIV4) compared with a US-licensed non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in children.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We did a multicentre, randomised controlled, observer-blinded, phase 3 trial of 146 sites including hospitals, clinics, and clinician offices in nine countries over two influenza seasons. We included children of either sex aged 6 months through 5 years. We stratified eligible participants and randomly assigned them (1:1), using a block size of four, to receive either aIIV4 or non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (ie, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV3] or quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV4]). We masked participants, parents or guardians, and outcome assessors to the administered vaccine. Designated personnel who were not masked administered aIIV4 in both seasons, or IIV3 in season one and IIV4 in season two. All vaccinations were administered intramuscularly. Children aged 6 through 35 months received one or two 0·25 mL doses, whereas those aged 3 through 5 years received one or two doses of 0·5 mL. The number of doses was dependent on previous vaccination status: vaccine-naive participants received a total of two doses of study vaccine, the first on day 1 and the second on day 29, whereas non-naive participants received only one dose on day 1. The primary outcome was relative vaccine efficacy assessed by RT-PCR-confirmed influenza due to any influenza strain in the overall study population and in prespecified age and dose subgroups.

Of these participants, 10 612 were vaccinated (n=5338 with aIIV4 and n=5274 with comparator). Relative vaccine efficacy was not different between aIIV4 and the comparator vaccines in the overall study population (relative vaccine efficacy -0·67, 95% CI -19·81 to 15·41). The relative vaccine efficacy in the 6 through 23-month subgroup was significantly greater for aIIV4 than for the comparator vaccine (relative vaccine efficacy 31·37, 95% CI 3·14-51·38). aIIV4 elicited superior immunogenic response compared with the comparator for all four vaccine strains (geometric mean titre ratios 1·91 [95% CI 1·8-2·0] for A/H1N1, 1·71 [1·6-1·8] for A/H3N2, 2·19 [2·0-2·4] for B/Yamagata, and 2·27 [2·0-2·6] for B/Victoria) and three heterologous strains (1·94 [1·6-2·3] for A/H3N2, 2·17 [1·8-2·6] for B/Yamagata, and 2·12 [1·6-2·7] for B/Victoria) in participants aged 6 months through 5 years.

Using the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) we investigated whether there was an increased risk of convulsions in children vaccinated with monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine in the 2009/10 season and also the risk after vaccination with the seasonal TIVs using the self-controlled case-series method. A total of 2366 children aged under 10 years with at least one convulsion recorded in the GPRD and who had received at least one influenza vaccine at anytime (2858 doses of TIV and 1895 doses of the monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine) were identified between May 2000 and April 2010. Over this period these 2366 children had a total of 3846 convulsion episodes. There was no increase in the incidence rate ratio (IRR) in the week after vaccination for either the monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine (IRR 0.99, 95% CI 0.61-1.60) or the first dose of TIV (IRR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53-1.52). A signal of an elevated risk in the first few days after the second dose of monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine was seen with an IRR for days 1-3 post vaccination of 3.48 (95% CI 0.86-14.07). This is consistent with findings of increased fever in a clinical trial. These results neither provide evidence of an increased risk of convulsions following TIV over a 10-year surveillance period nor following a single dose of the ASO3 adjuvanted monovalent H1N1 vaccine in 2009/10."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009 created an urgent need to develop vaccines for mass immunization. To guide decisions regarding the optimal immunization dosage and schedule for adults, we evaluated two monovalent, inactivated, unadjuvanted H1N1 influenza vaccines in independent, but simultaneously conducted, multi-center Phase 2 trials of identical design.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Healthy adults, stratified by age (18-64 years and ≥65 years), were randomized (1:1 allocation), in a double-blind, parallel-group design, to receive two intramuscular doses (21 days apart) of vaccine containing approximately 15 μg or 30 μg of hemagglutinin (HA). Primary endpoints were safety (reactogenicity for 8 days after each vaccination and vaccine-associated serious adverse events during the 7 month study) and immunogenicity (proportion of subjects, stratified by age, achieving a serum hemagglutination inhibition [HI] antibody titer ≥1:40 or a ≥4-fold rise in titer after a single injection of either dosage).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Both vaccines were well-tolerated. A single 15 μg dose induced HI titers ≥1:40 in 90% of younger adults (95% confidence interval [CI] 82-95%) and 81% of elderly (95% CI 71-88%) who received Sanofi-Pasteur vaccine (subsequently found to contain 24 μg HA in the standard potency assay), and in 80% of younger adults (95% CI 71-88%) and 60% of elderly (95% CI 50-70%) who received CSL vaccine. Both vaccines were significantly more immunogenic in younger compared with elderly adults by at least one endpoint measure. Increasing the dose to 30 μg raised the frequency of HI titers ≥1:40 in the elderly by approximately 10%. Higher dosage did not significantly enhance immunogenicity in younger adults and a second dose provided little additional benefit to either age group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These trials provided evidence for policymakers that a single 15 μg dose of 2009 A/H1N1 vaccine would likely protect most U.S. adults and suggest a potential benefit of a 30 μg dose for the elderly."

Addition of MF59 significantly boosted antibody to H5N1 to levels associated with protection. At 16 months, we undertook a follow-up study to assess the effect of H5N3 revaccination. Geometric mean titres (GMTs) of antibody by haemagglutination-inhibition (HI), microneutralisation (MN) and single radial haemolysis (SRH) indicated that protective antibody titres did not exist at 16 months after two-dose priming. Twenty-one days after revaccination, there was significant boosting of antibody compared to GMTs achieved 21 days after two-dose priming in the original study (P<0.001). MF59 significantly increased GMTs of antibody when compared to non-adjuvanted vaccine (P<0.001)."

Our primary objective was to prospectively compare the effect of IFNbeta-1a (Avonex), IFNbeta-1b (Betaseron), and glatiramer acetate (GA, Copaxone) on the relapse rate in patients with RRMS. Between August 1996 and September 1999, 156 consecutive patients with clinically definite RRMS with a Kurtzke scale (EDSS) score of 4 or less were followed for 12 months, from the time of initiating therapy or electing to remain untreated. Prior 2-year relapse history and available chart information was carefully reviewed at the time of enrolment. Thirty-three of 156 elected no treatment (mean age 32.5 years; mean EDSS 2.64) at enrolment; 40 elected IFNbeta-1a (mean age 32.4 years; mean EDSS 2.69), 41 IFNbeta-1b (mean age 32.1 years; mean EDSS 2.56), and 42 chose GA (mean age 31.5 years; mean EDSS 2.57). Annual relapse rate based upon the 2 years prior to enrolment was 1.08 in the untreated group, 1.20 in the AV group, 1.21 in the BE group, and 1.10 in the GA group. There were no statistically significant differences among the four groups at enrolment. After 12 months of treatment, patients in the untreated groups had a relapse rate of 0.97, whereas patients in the IFNbeta-1a, IFNbeta-1b, and GA groups had relapse rate of 0.85, 0.61, and 0.62, respectively. Compared to the untreated group, reduction in the relapse rate was statistically significant only in the GA (P=0.003) and IFNbeta-1b (P=0.002) groups, in contrast to the IFNbeta-1a treated patients, who did not show a significant reduction (P=0.309). Compared to the untreated patients, mean EDSS was significantly reduced only in the GA (P=0.001) and IFNbeta-1b (P=0.01), in contrast to IFNbeta-1a treated patients (P=0.51). In this prospective, controlled, open-label, non-randomized 12-month study, treatment with only GA and IFNbeta-1b significantly reduced the relapse rate compared to untreated patients, supporting early treatment in RRMS. Our results are similar to the observations made after 12 months of therapy in phase III studies of IFNbeta-1a, IFNbeta-1b, and GA. Despite some limitations of the study design, the results provide helpful clinical information regarding the relative efficacy of each therapy in mildly affected treatment-naïve RRMS patients."

            "abstract": "It has recently been recognised that vaccine adjuvants play a critical role in directing the nature of a vaccine induced effector response. In the present study, several adjuvants were evaluated for their ability to protect sheep after field vaccination with the larval-specific Haemonchus contortus antigen, HcsL3. Using a suboptimal antigen dose, aluminium adjuvant was shown to reduce the cumulative faecal egg counts (cFEC) and worm burden by 23% and 25% respectively, in agreement with a previous study. The addition of Quil A to the aluminium-adjuvanted vaccine brought cFEC back to control levels. Vaccination with the adjuvant DEAE-dextran almost doubled the protection compared to the aluminium-adjuvanted vaccine resulting in 40% and 41% reduction in cFEC and worm counts compared to controls. Examination of skin responses following i.d. injection of exsheathed L3, revealed that cFEC was negatively correlated with wheal size and tissue eosinophils for the DEAE-dextran and aluminium-adjuvanted groups respectively. These studies have for the first time shown the potential of DEAE-dextran adjuvant for helminth vaccines, and discovered significant cellular correlates of vaccine-induced protection."

It has been proposed that pre-IVF Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) adjuvant therapy may improve ovarian response and pregnancy rates in women with diminished ovarian reserve. This meta-analysis aims to investigate efficacy of DHEA as an adjuvant to improve ovarian response and IVF outcome in women with diminished ovarian reserve. Electronic databases were searched under the following terms: (DHEA) and (diminished ovarian reserve) and/or (poor response). Studies were included if they reported at least one of the following outcomes; clinical pregnancy rate, number of oocytes retrieved, miscarriage rate. We identified 22 publications determining effects of DHEA in clinical trials. Only 3 controlled studies were eligible for meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in the clinical pregnancy rate and miscarriage rates between women pre-treated with DHEA compared to those without DHEA pre-treatment (RR 1.87, 95% CI 0.96-3.64; and RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.21-1.65, respectively). The number of oocytes retrieved (WMD -1.88, 95% CI -2.08, 1.67; P < 0.001) was significantly lower in the DHEA group. In conclusion, based on the limited available evidence from a total of approximately 200 IVF cycles, there are insufficient data to support a beneficial role of DHEA as an adjuvant to controlled ovarian stimulation in IVF cycle. Well-designed, randomised controlled trials as well as more exact knowledge about DHEA mechanisms of action are needed to support use of DHEA in standard practice for poor-responders."

The first study was a phase II, randomized trial conducted in 104 children aged 6-35 months vaccinated with the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine containing 1.9 µg haemagglutinin antigen (HA) and AS03B (5.93 mg tocopherol) and the second study, a phase III, non-randomized trial conducted in 210 children and adolescents aged 3-17 years vaccinated with the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA and AS03A (11.86 mg tocopherol). Approximately one year after the first dose, all children with available data were seropositive for haemagglutinin inhibition and neutralising antibody titres, but a decline in geometric mean antibody titres was noted.

The vaccine did not raise any safety concern, though these trials were not designed to detect rare events. In conclusion, 2 doses of the AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine at 2 different dosages had a clinically acceptable safety profile, and induced high and persistent humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in children aged 6-35 months and 3-17 years.

In 24 evaluable patients, no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed in patients treated at any dose level within the first 28 days; however, grade 3 myelosuppression developed after day 28 in all 13 patients treated with 50 mg/d CC-5013. In 12 patients, dose reduction to 25 mg/d was well tolerated and therefore considered the maximal tolerated dose (MTD). Importantly, no significant somnolence, constipation, or neuropathy has been seen in any cohort. Best responses of at least 25% reduction in paraprotein occurred in 17 (71%) of 24 patients (90% confidence interval [CI], 52%-85%), including 11 (46%) patients who had received prior Thal. Stable disease (less than 25% reduction in paraprotein) was observed in an additional 2 (8%) patients. Therefore, 17 (71%) of 24 patients (90% CI, 52%-85%) demonstrated benefit from treatment. Our study therefore provides the basis for the evaluation of CC-5013, either alone or in combination, to treat patients with MM at earlier stages of disease."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Cutaneous warts are highly prevalent lesions caused by the infection of keratinocytes by different types of human papillomaviruses. Although cutaneous warts are capable of resolving spontaneously, these infections can persist for long periods of time by evading the host immune system, and, as a result, many patients choose to seek treatment. Imiquimod is an immune response modifier that is approved as a topical cream for the treatment of anogenital warts by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, the efficacy of imiquimod in the treatment of cutaneous warts has not been well established.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this article is to systematically review the published literature regarding the efficacy of imiquimod in the treatment of cutaneous warts, and to evaluate the quality and outcomes of these studies.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A literature search was performed through clinical queries PubMed (National Library of Medicine) database and the Cochrane database. All completed studies written in English and published through May 2014 were considered. Studies evaluating the use of imiquimod for anogenital warts were excluded. There were no other restrictions based on patient age, sex, ethnicity, or skin type. The studies were evaluated and assessed based on study design, patient population, treatment regimen, clinical outcome, and adverse events.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 393 records were identified in the initial search; 23 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and included in the review. Of these studies, six publications reported on immunocompromised individuals only. The highest quality study identified was a grade B, level 3 case-control cohort study in which patients with multiple warts had certain warts treated with imiquimod and others left untreated to serve as a control. The remaining studies identified were level 4 non-controlled case series (grade C) and level 5 case reports (grade D). In immunocompetent patients enrolled in non-controlled studies, the combined rate of patients achieving complete response to therapy was 44%, ranging from 27 to 89%. However, there was variation in the dose frequency and application among these studies. In immunosuppressed patients, two studies and four case reports were identified. Clinical improvement was seen in 33-50% of patients, with no patients experiencing complete clinical clearance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There have been several studies demonstrating the successful use of imiquimod to treat recalcitrant cutaneous warts, either alone or as combination therapy. However, these studies are limited in number, include small populations, and are non-controlled. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of imiquimod, dose frequency and application, and optimal combination with other therapeutic measures such as paring, salicylic acid, or other destructive procedures."

The main objective of our study was to provide data on 89 patients who used a 5% imiquimod cream for the treatment of cutaneous tumors at the Cutaneous Oncology Group of the Dermatology Department of Hospital das Clinicas from 2003 to 2008.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Here, we present our experience in the treatment of 123 cutaneous tumors of various types, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), Bowen's disease, erythroplasia of Queyrat, Paget's disease, and trichoepithelioma, with 5% imiquimod cream from 2003 to 2008 in the Cutaneous Oncology Group of the Dermatology Department of Hospital das Clinicas. Patients were divided into two separate groups according to their diagnosis and comorbidities; these comorbidities included epidermodysplasia verruciformis, xeroderma pigmentosum, albinism, basal cell nevus syndrome, Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, HIV, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, and kidney transplantation. Treatment duration, response to imiquimod, follow-up, recurrence, and local and systemic reactions associated with use of the drug were analyzed. Epidemiological data were obtained and cure rates were calculated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The ratio of women to men was 1.28:1, and the mean age was 63.1 years. Tumors were located mainly on the face, back, trunk, and legs. For patients with comorbidities, the overall cure rate was 38%. These specific patients demonstrated cure rates of 83.5% for superficial BCC and 50% for Bowen's disease. Aggressive BCC and superficial and nodular BCC did not present a good response to treatment. Trichoepitheliomas and nodular BCC showed a partial response, and erythroplasia of Queyrat showed a complete response. For patients without comorbidities, the overall cure rate was 73%. For these patients, the cure rates were 85.7% for superficial and nodular BCC, 88% for superficial BCC, 57% for Bowen's disease, 50% for nodular BCC, and 50% for aggressive BCC. One SCC lesion demonstrated a complete response, and tumors caused by Paget's disease and erythroplasia of Queyrat presented a partial response. None of the tumors considered as clinically cured recurred. Thirty-seven lesions demonstrated no response to imiquimod. Having a cutaneous comorbidity, high-risk tumors such as mixed aggressive BCC (sclerodermiform or micronodular), nodular BCC, or Bowen's disease, and presenting no local reaction to imiquimod were considered as risk factors for a worse prognosis. We demonstrate that patients with no response to imiquimod, even when they demonstrated no local reaction, can undergo another cycle of six weeks of imiquimod treatment and show a complete response. The healing pattern led to good cosmetic outcomes, and the side effects were tolerable.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our experience confirms imiquimod as an effective treatment option for several types of cutaneous tumors, especially in patients without the cutaneous comorbidities cited above and with low-risk tumors. Imiquimod has a relatively low cost compared to other therapeutic options and can be delivered via ambulatory care to patients with surgery contraindications, and its side effects are tolerable."

            "abstract": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 has been a public health concern for almost 20years due to its potential ability to become transmissible among humans. Phase I and II clinical trials have assessed safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccines. A shortage of vaccine is likely to occur during the first months of a pandemic. Hence, determining whether to give one dose to more people or two doses to fewer people to best protect the population is essential. We use hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers as an immune correlate for avian influenza vaccines. Using an established relationship to obtain a theoretical vaccine efficacy from immunogenicity data from thirteen arms of six phase I and phase II clinical trials of inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccines, we assessed: (1) the proportion of theoretical vaccine efficacy achieved after a single dose (defined as primary response level), and (2) whether theoretical efficacy increases after a second dose, with and without adjuvant. Participants receiving vaccine with AS03 adjuvant had higher primary response levels (range: 0.48-0.57) compared to participants receiving vaccine with MF59 adjuvant (range: 0.32-0.47), with no observed trends in primary response levels by antigen dosage. After the first and second doses, vaccine with AS03 at dosage levels 3.75, 7.5 and 15mcg had the highest estimated theoretical vaccine efficacy: Dose (1) 45% (95% CI: 36-57%), 53% (95% CI: 42-63%) and 55% (95% CI: 44-64%), respectively and Dose (2) 93% (95% CI: 89-96%), 97% (95% CI: 95-98%) and 97% (95% CI: 96-100%), respectively. On average, the estimated theoretical vaccine efficacy of lower dose adjuvanted vaccines (AS03 and MF59) was 17% higher than that of higher dose unadjuvanted vaccines, suggesting that including an adjuvant is dose-sparing. These data indicate adjuvanted inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine produces high theoretical efficacy after two doses to protect individuals against a potential avian influenza pandemic."

The use of recombinant human erythropoietin has led to the eradication of severe anemia in the dialysis population. Correction of anemia in these patients has been associated with better quality of life and clinical outcomes. Some hemodialysis patients have anemia that either is relatively refractory to epoetin therapy or requires very high doses of epoetin (i.e., hyporesponsiveness), despite having adequate iron stores, and are thus unable to achieve or maintain target hemoglobin levels. Several pharmacologic agents have been studied for effects on improving response to epoetin, either to counter hyporesponsiveness or simply to reduce epoetin use for purely economic reasons. This review examines the available literature regarding the efficacy of these potential pharmacologic adjuvants to epoetin in the treatment of anemia in patients on maintenance hemodialysis, with special emphasis on androgens, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), and L-carnitine. A review of published guidelines and recommendations for use of these agents in hemodialysis patients is provided."

In the case of RU 41470 (Biostim), an immunomodulator with a known structure and of biological origin affects immunocompetent cells and two essential mediators: II1 and CSF. Because of multiple interactions between anti-infectious, anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic responses, as well as the pleiotropism of mediators, there exists no absolute predictive index of activity in vivo and, independently of models of immune deficiency, experimental infections are a particularly useful pharmacological model for study of the anti-infectious activity of any immunomodulator. In this model, RU 41470 tested by oral, intraperitoneal and aerosol administration, proved to be active regardless of the type of infectious agent for extracellular bacteria, intracellular bacteria, viruses or yeasts. Because of special local features of anti-infectious defences (pulmonary, cutaneous), the target organ must be identified when studying mechanism of action. RU 41740 stimulates the metabolic activities of alveolar macrophage and the target organ is the respiratory tract. From a clinical pharmacology standpoint, stimulation of different immune components has been investigated with RU 41470 at different dosages, using double-blind versus placebo designs. Target pathology, regardless of severity, includes a risk of infection and the existence of an immunological deficiency. Chronic bronchitis is a reference pathology since patients are subject to episodes of infection, resulting in acute decompensation and contributing to worsening of the ventilatory obstructive disorder. Clinical efficacy in terms of anti-infectious prophylaxis must be evaluated by a strict methodological approach: randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials with prolonged follow-up. RU 41470 is effective in prophylaxis of respiratory infections in chronic bronchitis (reduction in the number of respiratory infections, their duration and in antibiotic consumption) and in prophylaxis of respiratory tract infections in children over one year old. Clinicians faced with the perplexity of the mechanism of action of immunomodulators and their number are preoccupied above all by the response which such an anti-infectious immunomodulator can offer in a context of clinical reality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The new diclofenac epolamine (DHEP) salt is much more soluble both in water and in lipid solvent than other diclofenac salts. The pharmaceutical addition of lecithin to DHEP leads to the formation of mixed micelles with high affinity to the cellular component, which guarantees the absorption of the active ingredient. We performed a bioavailability randomized, cross-over study to compare the plasma profiles of diclofenamic acid after repeated epicutaneous administration of the new topical formulation with those of the marketed DHEP formulation without lecithin. Based on a randomization list, 12 healthy volunteers were asked to apply one of the two formulations twice a day for 10 consecutive days. The other formulation was given after a washout period of 1 week. Blood samples were collected before the morning epicutaneous dose on days 1, 3, 5 and 8 of treatment and on day 10 at different sampling times until 24 h after the application. The pharmacokinetic analysis showed a significantly higher plasma concentration of diclofenamic acid after the application of DHEP lecithin, which indicates a better saturation of the subcutaneous tissues underlying the application site. This also indicates increased local availability of the active principle. In conclusion, the new DHEP formulation with lecithin should have a therapeutic advantage compared with the formulation without lecithin, even in cases of short- to medium-term treatments."

Epidemiological evidences in humans and animal studies suggest that DHEA(S) may have cardioprotective, antiobesity, antidiabetic, and immuno-enhancing properties. These observations led to the proposal that restoration of DHEA to young adult levels may have beneficial effects on age-related conditions. Most clinical trials of DHEA replacement have been limited due to small samples and short duration, restriction to one sex, failure to adjust for baseline endogenous hormone level and age, or lack of placebo comparison groups. We designed a double blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial to determine the acceptability, benefits, and adverse effects of 50 mg daily oral DHEA replacement for one year in 110 men and 115 women, aged 55 to 85, who were healthy and not currently using hormone therapy.

Changes in mood and well-being, cognitive function, and sexuality were assessed. Information on potentially confounding covariates such as smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, diet and dietary supplements were obtained, and potential adverse effects of DHEA administration were monitored. This study enables an examination of the benefits of DHEA administration on the health of older men and women, and the influence of gender, age, and baseline endogenous DHEA level on each outcome variable. Potential mechanisms of DHEA action, including the biotransformation of DHEA to active steroids and steroid metabolites, enhancement of IGF-I bioavailability, and inhibition of IL-6 production can also be evaluated."

PK parameters such as C(max), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity) were also determined. The formulations were considered bioequivalent if the geometric mean ratios of the log-transformed C(max) and AUC values were within the equivalence range (80%-125%) predetermined by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of the People's Republic of China. Tolerability was based on the observation of adverse events (AEs), monitoring of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, electrocardiography) and laboratory tests (hematology, blood biochemistry, hepatic function, urinalysis), and subject's interview on AEs.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The study was performed in 20 healthy Chinese male volunteers (mean [SD] age, 21.4 [2.2] years; weight, 64.1 [5.5] kg; height, 173.7 [5.3] cm; and body mass index, 21.2 [1.6] kg/m(2)). The mean (SD) C(max), T(max), AUC(0-24), and AUC(0-infinity) after administration of the test and reference formulations, respectively, were as follows: ampicillin, C(max), 13.45 (3.43) versus 15.04 (5.68) microg/mL, T(max), 1.58 (0.49) versus 1.78 (0.55) hours, AUC(0-24), 50.78 (13.39) versus 57.44 (17.27) micro/mL/h, and AUC(0-infinity), 51.95 (13.45) versus 58.74 (17.19) microg/mL/h; probenecid, C(max), 15.56 (2.94) versus 16.01 (2.88) microg/mL, T(max), 2.85 (0.78) versus 3.30 (1.51) hours, AUC(0-24), 129.23 (27.59) versus 127.29 (26.89) microg/mL/h, and AUC(0-infinity) 133.85 (28.80) versus 131.21 (28.25) microg/mL/h. On ANOVA, neither period nor sequence effects were observed for any of the PK properties. The 90% CIs of ampicillin for the log-transformed ratios of C(max), AUC(0-24), and AUC(0-infinity)) were 86.5% to 108.0%, 96.7% to 107.8%, and 83.3% to 100.7%, respectively, and the corresponding values for probenecid were 90.2% to 108.3%, 96.8% to 107.8%, and 97.2% to 108.5%. No AEs were observed or reported up to 1 week after study end.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this small study in healthy Chinese male volunteers, a single 1500-mg dose of the dispersible tablet formulation (test) of ampicillin/probenecid met the SFDA's regulatory criteria for bioequivalence to the reference capsule formulation based on the rate and extent of absorption.

            "abstract": "The inclusion complexation of melatonin (MT) with modified cyclodextrins (CDs) was studied with an objective of improving the solubility and nasal absorption of MT. The formation of inclusion complex of MT with Hydroxypropyl beta CD (HPbeta CD) and randomly methylated beta CD (RMbeta CD) was characterized in solution and solid states by phase solubility and differential scanning calorimetry analyses. The phase solubility data indicate a linear increase in the solubility of MT with CDs demonstrating Higuchi's A(L)-type phase solubility profiles. The effect of CDs on the permeation of MT across EpiAirway(TM)-100 cultures was studied using a modified nonstatic diffusion setup. CDs were employed at different concentrations with 1% w/v micronized MT suspension in hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) vehicle. At low CD concentrations (1% w/v), the permeation of MT from HPMC formulation was significantly increased (125%,p < .001). However, the permeation was significantly reduced when CDs were used at relatively high concentrations (5 to 10% w/v concentration for HPbetaCD and 10% w/v concentration for RMbetaCD,p < .001). All the tissues were viable with good tissue integrity at the end of permeation experiments, as measured by methylthiazoletetrazolium assay and transepithelial electrical resistance measurements. In conclusion, formation of inclusion complex of MT with HPbetaCD and RMbetaCD was demonstrated in solution and solid state. Both HPbetaCD and RM betaCD at 1% w/v concentration were found to improve the nasal permeability of MT from HPMC gel formulations."

            "abstract": "Lenograstim is the glycosylated recombinant form of human granulocyte colony stimulating factor. The drug is used to reduce the risk of life-threatening infection in patients with neutropenia, particularly after cytotoxic chemotherapy. Lenograstim accelerates neutrophil recovery significantly after chemotherapy, with beneficial effects on clinical end-points such as incidence of laboratory-confirmed infection and length of hospital stay. Chemotherapy dose intensity has also been increased in patients receiving lenograstim, notably those with breast or small cell lung cancer, although improvements in tumour response and survival have not been demonstrated. Lenograstim also assists neutrophil recovery in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, and stimulates the production of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) for autologous transfusion after aggressive chemotherapy. Lenograstim also mobilises CD34+ cells more efficiently in unit dose terms than filgrastim and has been used successfully to mobilise PBSCs from healthy donors for allogeneic transplantation. Randomised trials have shown increases in rates of disease remission after lenograstim therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, with no evidence of stimulation of malignant blasts. The drug has also shown potential in the mobilisation of nonmalignant PBSCs for autotransplantation in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia. Other studies show efficacy of lenograstim in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, aplastic anaemia, in children with severe chronic neutropenia and in the reversal of neutropenia related to antiviral therapy in patients with AIDS, although data are not extensive. Cost analyses of lenograstim have been carried out from a hospital perspective, although results have been inconclusive. Cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit data are lacking at present. Lenograstim is well tolerated, with bone pain and injection site reactions being reported most frequently in clinical trials.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Lenograstim has been confirmed as a valuable adjunct to minimise the haematological toxicity of myelosuppressive chemotherapy in patients with malignant disease. The drug also enhances neutrophil recovery in patients undergoing stem cell rescue, and assists PBSC mobilisation. Data indicate clinical benefit with lenograstim in myeloid disorders, with no evidence of malignant blast cell proliferation. Further studies are required to assess more fully the pharmacoeconomic implications of the use of lenograstim and other recombinant growth factors, to provide more data on the efficacy of the drug in the management of disease-related neutropenia, and to clarify fully its position relative to filgrastim."

            "abstract": "Bacterial flagellins are potent inducers of innate immune responses in the mouse lung because they bind to TLR5 expressed on the apical surfaces of airway epithelial cells. TLR engagement leads to the initiation of a signaling cascade that results in a pro-inflammatory response with subsequent up-regulation of several cytokines and leads to adaptive immune responses. We examined the ability of two soluble flagellins, a monomeric flagellin expressed in Escherichia coli and a highly purified polymeric flagellin directly isolated from Salmonella, to enhance the efficacy of influenza vaccines in mice. Here we demonstrate that both flagellins co-administered intranasally with inactivated A/PR/8/34 (PR8) virus induced robust increases of systemic influenza-specific IgA and IgG titers and resulted in a more comprehensive humoral response as indicated by the increase of IgG2a and IgG2b subclass responses. Groups immunized with the adjuvanted vaccines were fully protected against high dose lethal challenge by homologous virus whereas inactivated PR8 alone conferred only partial protection. Finally we show that shortly after immunization the adjuvanted vaccines induced a dramatic increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung, resulting in extensive lung infiltration by granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages. Our results reveal a promising perspective for the use of both soluble monomeric and polymeric flagellin as mucosal vaccine adjuvants to improve protection against influenza epidemics as well as a range of other infectious diseases."

Besides,the improvement of the blood lipid and high sensitivity C reactive protein( hs-CRP) in the trial group were better than those of the control group after treatment,and the difference was statistically significant( P< 0. 001). Funnel plots and Egger's linear regression showed that there was no publication bias. By sensitivity analysis,it showed that the results of this study were stable and reliable. No obvious adverse drug reactions were observed in all studies. TSA analysis showed that the evidence of Meta-analysis was reliable. SYC combined with routine Western medicine treatment for SAP can improve the total effective rate of angina pectoris,reduce 24 h total ischemia time,ST segment depression amplitude,duration of angina pectoris attack,frequency of angina pectoris attack and nitroglycerin dosage,and also can improve blood lipid and hs-CRP levels."

We evaluated the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of different formulations of cell-derived MF59-adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted A/H1N1 influenza vaccine in children and adolescents. This was a randomized, single-blind, multicenter study with a total of 666 healthy subjects aged 6 months-17 y in one of 3 vaccination groups, each receiving formulations containing different amounts of influenza A/H1N1 antigen with or without MF59. A booster trivalent seasonal MF59 vaccine was administered one year after primary vaccinations. Antibody titers were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization assays obtained on days 1, 22, 43, 366, and 387 (3 weeks post booster). Safety was monitored throughout the study. One vaccination with 3.75 μg of A/H1N1 antigen formulated with 50% MF59 (3.75_halfMF59) or 7.5 μg of A/H1N1 antigen formulated with 100% MF59 (7.5_fullMF59) induced an HI titer ≥1:40 in >70% of children in the 1-<3, 3-8, and 9-17 y cohorts; however, 2 vaccinations with nonadjuvanted 15 μg A/H1N1 antigen were needed to achieve this response in the 1-<3 and 3-8 y cohorts. Among children aged 6-11 months, 1 dose of 7.5_fullMF59 resulted in an HI titer ≥1:40 in >70% while 2 doses of 3.75_halfMF59 were required to achieve this result. All vaccines were well tolerated. Our findings support the immunogenicity and safety of the 3.75_halfMF59 (2 doses for children <12 months) and 7.5_fullMF59 vaccine formulations for use in children and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 y The use of the 3.75_halfMF59 could have the benefit of antigen and adjuvant sparing, increasing the available vaccine doses allowing vaccination of more people."

Fifteen case studies regarding the efficacy and safety of sulpiride, risperidone, olanzapine, lithium, lamotrigine, fluvoxamine, and bromocriptine as clozapine adjuncts were found. A total of 33 schizophrenic or schizoaffective patients were included. Of the 15 studies, 8 were associated with risperidone. The duration and dosage of previous clozapine monotherapy was adequate for 16 patients. Plasma clozapine level was assessed for only 7 patients. Outcome measures were used for only 11 patients. The outcome was positive in 13 studies. Combined treatments were generally well tolerated, and side effects never resulted in discontinuation of treatment. Most case studies favor the use of risperidone as an adjunctive agent in clozapine-resistant schizophrenic or schizoaffective patients. However, small numbers of patients and other methodological shortcomings limit the impact of evidence provided."

Potential further reductions in fracture rate should be observed through nasal spray delivery to address the poor compliance associated with patient dislike of repeated PTH 1-34 subcutaneous injections. In vitro human osteoblast-like Saos-2 cell intracellular cAMP levels were used to define PTH 1-34 nasal spray formulation bioactivity. The chemically synthesised PTH 1-34 had an EC50 of 0.76nM. Absorption enhancers polyethylene glycol (15)-hydroxystearate (Solutol® HS15), poloxamer 407, chitosan or sodium hyaluronate did not diminish the bioactivity of PTH 1-34 within an in vitro cell culture model (p >0.05). We also demonstrated the effectiveness of the transmucosal absorption enhancer Solutol® HS15 in a nasal spray formulation using a preclinical pharmacokinetic model. In Sprague-Dawley rats without the absorption enhancer the uptake of PTH 1-34 into the blood via intranasal delivery produced a Cmax of 2.1±0.5ng/ml compared to 13.7±1.6ng/ml with Solutol® HS15 enhancer (p=0.016) and a Cmax14.8±8ng/ml in subcutaneous injections. Together these data illustrate that the nasal spray formulation bioactivity in vitro is not affected by the nasal spray absorption enhancers investigated, and the Solutol® HS15 nasal spray formulation had an equivalent pharmacokinetic profile to subcutaneous injection in the rat model. The Solutol® HS15 formulation therefore demonstrated potential as a PTH 1-34 nasal spray formulation for the treatment of osteoporosis."

Peanut allergies are also on the rise and often do not spontaneously resolve, leaving individuals at-risk for potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis throughout their lifetime. Currently, two forms of peanut immunotherapy, oral immunotherapy (OIT) and epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT), are in Phase III clinical trials and have shown promise to induce desensitization in many subjects. However, there are several limitations with OIT and EPIT, such as allergic side effects, daily dosing requirements, and the infrequent outcome of long-term tolerance. Next-generation therapies for peanut allergy should aim to overcome these limitations, which may be achievable with adjuvanted immunotherapy. An adjuvant can be defined as anything that enhances, accelerates, or modifies an immune response to a particular antigen. Adjuvants may allow for lower doses of antigen to be given leading to decreased side effects; may only need to be administered every few weeks or months rather than daily exposures; and may induce a long-lasting protective effect. In this review article, we highlight examples of adjuvants and formulations that have shown pre-clinical efficacy in treating peanut allergy."

Current vaccines, mainly administered parenterally, have been shown to be suboptimal in terms of efficacy, particularly where local IgA responses are concerned. Recent investigations of virosomes as delivery systems for viral HA and NA antigens have demonstrated an improved immune response. This paper investigates the efficacy of a novel virosome-based intranasal influenza vaccine by its ability to reduce disease symptoms and its effect on viral shedding in nasal secretions of immunised ferrets. The use of ferrets in the study of influenza vaccines is based on the good comparability between ferret and human response to the disease. Intranasal, as opposed to parenteral, administration of a trivalent virosome-based subunit vaccine adjuvanted with HLT provides an almost total prevention of virus shedding combined with a high level of immunological protection against homologous virus challenge. The ease of application of an intranasal vaccine may have positive repercussions in the adoption of influenza vaccinations, particularly in 'at-risk' groups."

In protocol 1 (n = 45: AA = 13, GM = 32), 1 x 10(6) IU of HuIFN-beta was administrated intravenously once a day for 7 days. On day 2, MCNU was administrated at a dose of 2 mg/kg b.w. intravenously and from day 3, radiation was started in five weekly fractions of 2 Gy for 6 weeks. Total dose was 60 Gy. Protocol 2 (n = 19: AA = 11, GM = 8) was comparable with protocol 1 except HuIFN-beta was administrated twice a day at a dose of 1 x 10(6) IU each. Protocol 3 (n = 13: AA = 5, GM = 8) differed from protocol 2 only in a high dose-hyperfractionated radiation which was given twice a day at a dose of 1.5 Gy each and for a total dose of 66 Gy. Antitumor effects were evaluated by survival and response rate determined by decrease of tumor size. Significant improvement was obtained in patients with AAs by protocol 2 and 3. Response rates of patients with AAs and GMs were 46.2% and 50% in protocol 1, 63.6% and 50% in protocol 2, and 80% and 50% in protocol 3, respectively. One and two year survival rates in AAs were 46.4% and 34.8% in protocol 1, both 75% in protocol 2, and both 100% in protocol 3. Survival rates in GMs were not different among them. Except of radiation necrosis, which was observed in 38.5% of the patients under protocol 3, there was no significant difference in the adverse effects among the three protocols. In the present study, the efficacy of IMR therapy for patients with malignant gliomas, especially for AAs, was cofirmed. We conclude that twice a day administrations of HuIFN-beta in combination with a high dose-hyperfractionated radiation provide increased efficacy in IMR therapy."

National screening programmes and antibiotic treatment have failed to decrease incidence, and to date no vaccines against genital chlamydia have been tested in clinical trials. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity, in humans, of a novel chlamydia vaccine based on a recombinant protein subunit (CTH522) in a prime-boost immunisation schedule.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This phase 1, first-in-human, double-blind, parallel, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was done at Hammersmith Hospital in London, UK, in healthy women aged 19-45 years. Participants were randomly assigned (3:3:1) to three groups: CTH522 adjuvanted with CAF01 liposomes (CTH522:CAF01), CTH522 adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide (CTH522:AH), or placebo (saline). Participants received three intramuscular injections of 85 μg vaccine (with adjuvant) or placebo to the deltoid region of the arm at 0, 1, and 4 months, followed by two intranasal administrations of 30 μg unadjuvanted vaccine or placebo (one in each nostril) at months 4·5 and 5·0. The primary outcome was safety and the secondary outcome was humoral immunogenicity (anti-CTH522 IgG seroconversion). This study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT02787109.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Between Aug 15, 2016, and Feb 13, 2017, 35 women were randomly assigned (15 to CTH522:CAF01, 15 to CTH522:AH, and five to placebo). 32 (91%) received all five vaccinations and all participants were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. No related serious adverse reactions were reported, and the most frequent adverse events were mild local injection-site reactions, which were reported in all (15 [100%] of 15) participants in the two vaccine groups and in three (60%) of five participants in the placebo group (p=0·0526 for both comparisons). Intranasal vaccination was not associated with a higher frequency of related local reactions (reported in seven [47%] of 15 participants in the active treatment groups vs three [60%] of five in the placebo group; p=1·000). Both CTH522:CAF01 and CTH522:AH induced anti-CTH522 IgG seroconversion in 15 (100%) of 15 participants after five immunisations, whereas no participants in the placebo group seroconverted. CTH522:CAF01 showed accelerated seroconversion, increased IgG titres, an enhanced mucosal antibody profile, and a more consistent cell-mediated immune response profile compared with CTH522:AH.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      CTH522 adjuvanted with either CAF01 or aluminium hydroxide appears to be safe and well tolerated.

            "abstract": "Adjuvants have been proven to be very effective in enhancement of immune response of many antigens. However, few studies involved head-to-head comparison of their potentials in inactive rabies virus vaccine. In this study, we investigated two types of aluminum adjuvants and five other adjuvants (BLPs, AS02, AS03, MF59 and Poly I:C) on their capacity in enhancing the efficacy of rabies vaccine. The differences in immunogenicity and potency of rabies vaccines with different adjuvants were evaluated by immunizations in ICR mice. Compared with other adjuvants, nano-sized aluminum induced earlier and more vigorous production of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies and facilitated a more effective protection in the challenge test. Based on these results, to comprehensively and systematically explore the role of adjuvants in rabies vaccine immunization, blood samples from four groups were chosen to perform mRNA sequencing. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of groups were identified, both gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were conducted for these DEGs. The results showed that there were significant differences in mRNA expression between the mice after immunization with different adjuvants, but the two aluminum adjuvant vaccines induced similar gene expression. Moreover, the data of enrichment analysis indicated that adjuvants were more advantageous in activating the pathways associated with antigen processing, presentation and initial immunity. These results revealed that adjuvants can be used as an enhancer in rabies vaccination, and nano-sized aluminum may be a candidate adjuvant for the development of more effective rabies vaccines. And these data also provide a basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying adjuvants enhancement of the immune response."

            "abstract": "In spite of current influenza vaccines being immunogenic, evolution of the influenza virus can reduce efficacy and so influenza remains a major threat to public health. One approach to improve influenza vaccines is to include adjuvants; substances that boost the immune response. Adjuvants are particularly beneficial for influenza vaccines administered during a pandemic when a rapid response is required or for use in patients with impaired immune responses, such as infants and the elderly. This review outlines the current use of adjuvants in human influenza vaccines, including what they are, why they are used and what is known of their mechanism of action. To date, six adjuvants have been used in licensed human vaccines: Alum, MF59, AS03, AF03, virosomes and heat labile enterotoxin (LT). In general these adjuvants are safe and well tolerated, but there have been some rare adverse events when adjuvanted vaccines are used at a population level that may discourage the inclusion of adjuvants in influenza vaccines, for example the association of LT with Bell's Palsy. Improved understanding about the mechanisms of the immune response to vaccination and infection has led to advances in adjuvant technology and we describe the experimental adjuvants that have been tested in clinical trials for influenza but have not yet progressed to licensure. Adjuvants alone are not sufficient to improve influenza vaccine efficacy because they do not address the underlying problem of mismatches between circulating virus and the vaccine. However, they may contribute to improved efficacy of next-generation influenza vaccines and will most likely play a role in the development of effective universal influenza vaccines, though what that role will be remains to be seen."

The seroprotection rate 21 days after the first dose of vaccine ranged from 69.5% (95% CI 65.9-72.8) for the 7.5 microg adjuvant split-virion formulation to 92.8% (91.9-93.6) for the 30 microg non-adjuvant split-virion formulation. The seroprotection rate was 86.5% (796 of 920; 84.1-88.7) in recipients of one dose of the 7.5 microg non-adjuvant split-virion vaccine compared with 9.8% (140 of 1432; 8.3-11.4) in recipients of placebo (p<0.0001). One dose of the 7.5 microg non-adjuvant split-virion vaccine induced seroprotection in 178 of 232 children (aged 3 years to <12 years; 76.7%, 70.7-82.0), 211 of 218 adolescents (12 years to <18 years; 96.8%, 93.5-98.7), 289 of 323 adults (18-60 years; 89.5%, 85.6-92.6), and 118 of 147 adults older than 60 years (80.3%, 72.9-86.4), meeting the European Union's licensure criteria for seroprotection in all age-groups. In children, a second dose of the 7.5 microg formulation increased the seroprotection rate to 97.7% (215 of 220, 94.8-99.3). Adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate, and self-limited. Severe adverse effects occurred in 69 (0.6%, 0.5-0.8) recipients of vaccine compared with one recipient (0.1%, 0-0.2) of placebo. The most common severe adverse reaction was fever, which occurred in 25 (0.22%; 0.14-0.33) recipients of vaccine after the first dose and four (0.04%; 0.01-0.09) recipients of vaccine after the second dose compared with no recipients of placebo after either dose.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      One dose of non-adjuvant split-virion vaccine containing 7.5 microg haemagglutinin could be promoted as the formulation of choice against 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 for people aged 12 years or older. In children (aged <12 years), two 7.5 mug doses might be needed.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      Sinovac Biotech, Hualan Biological Bacterin, China National Biotec Group, Beijing Tiantan Biological Products, Changchun Institute of Biological Products, Changchun Changsheng Life Sciences, Jiangsu Yanshen Biological Technology Stock, Zhejiang Tianyuan Bio-Pharmaceutical, Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products, Shanghai Institute of Biological Products, and Dalian Aleph Biomedical."

The vaccine was developed primarily for use in elderly populations, but non-elderly individuals might also benefit. To evaluate this hypothesis, 301 healthy adults were assigned randomly to receive two intramuscular injections of either FLUAD (150 subjects) or a non-adjuvanted vaccine, Fluzone (151 subjects), in two trials conducted at a 1-year interval. Injections consisted of 15 micrograms per 0.5 ml dose. Vaccine composition was A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1), A/Johannesburg/33/94 (H3N2), and B/Harbin/7/94 for the first injection and A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1), A/Nanchang/933/95 (H3N2), and B/Harbin/7/94 for the second injection. Immunogenicity was evaluated at 28 and 180 days post-immunization. FLUAD was generally well tolerated in healthy adults when compared with Fluzone. FLUAD was associated with increased pain at the injection site after immunization. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of injection-site warmth, chills, myalgia, and analgesic/antipyretic use occurred in the FLUAD group after the first injection but not after the second injection. In both groups, most of these local and systemic reactions were classified as mild. FLUAD was more immunogenic than Fluzone following both injections. After the first injection, statistically significant differences were found in the percentage of subjects with four-fold rises in hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titers at 28 days post-immunization for the B antigen. After the second injection, the FLUAD group had significantly higher HI titers, a significantly higher percentage with a four-fold increase in titer, and a significantly greater percentage of subjects with titers >/=160 for the H3N2 antigen at 28 days. Only minor immunogenicity differences between the two groups were seen at 180 days. Compared with Fluzone, FLUAD was associated with increased immunogenicity and mild post-immunization reactions in healthy adults. The magnitude of increased immunogenicity in healthy adults was less than that seen in elderly populations."

We developed a dissolving microneedle patch (MicroHyala, MH) made of hyaluronic acid and showed that transcutaneous vaccination using MH induced a strong immune response against various antigens in mice. In the present study, we investigated the clinical safety and efficacy of a novel transcutaneous influenza vaccine using MH (flu-MH), which contains trivalent influenza hemagglutinins (15 μg each). Subjects of the TCI group were treated transcutaneously with flu-MH, and were compared with subjects who received subcutaneous injections of a solution containing 15 μg of each influenza antigen (SCI group). No severe local or systemic adverse events were detected in either group and immune responses against A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains were induced equally in the TCI and SCI groups. Moreover, the efficacy of the vaccine against the B strain in the TCI group was stronger than that in the SCI group. Influenza vaccination using MH is promising for practical use as an easy and effective method to replace conventional injections systems."

Its mechanism of action is not fully understood, but enhancement of the interaction between the antigen and the dendritic cell seems to be involved. When used with seasonal influenza vaccines, an increase occurs in the hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers against some, but not all, seasonal vaccine influenza strains. The adjuvant effect is more pronounced when MF59 is combined with novel influenza antigens such as H9 and H5. The use of the adjuvant is associated with an increase in the frequency of local and systemic early post-vaccine adverse events (3-7 days), but no increase in adverse events was observed thereafter. Currently, MF59 is under evaluation as an adjuvant with other antigens such as pandemic influenza antigens and cytomegalovirus antigens."

            "abstract": "Several approaches are being taken worldwide to develop vaccines against H5N1 viruses; most of them, however, pose both practical and immunological challenges. One potential strategy for improving the immunogenicity of vaccines involves the use of alphavirus replicons and VP22, a herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) protein. In this study, we analysed the antigenic peptides and homogeneity of the HA sequences (human isolates of the H5N1 subtype, from 1997 to 2003) and explored a novel alphavirus replicon system of VP22 fused with HA, to assess whether the immunogenicity of an HA-based replicon vaccine could be induced and augmented via fusion with VP22. Further, replicon particles expressing VP22, and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were individually used as controls. Cellular immune responses in mice immunised with replicons were evaluated by identifying specific intracellular cytokine production with flow cytometry (FCM). Animal-based experimentation indicated that both the IL-4 expression of CD4(+) T cells and the IFN-gamma expression of CD8(+) T cells were significantly increased in mice immunised with VPR-HA and VPR-VP22/HA. A dose titration effect vis-à-vis both IL-4 expression and IFN-gamma expression were observed in VPR-HA- and VPR-VP22/HA-vaccinated mice. Our results revealed that both VPR-VP22/HA and VPR-HA replicon particles presented a promising approach for developing vaccines against human-avian influenza, and VP22 could enhance the immunogenicity of the HA antigens to which it is fused."

Here we assess the role of AS03(A) (an oil-in-water emulsion based Adjuvant System containing tocopherol) in this prime-boost concept using H5N1 as a model shift influenza antigen. In this open, non-randomised study (NCT00506350; an extension of an earlier randomised study) we assessed immunogenicity in nine groups of 35-50 volunteers aged 19-61 years following administration of AS03(A)-adjuvanted split-virion H5N1 vaccine containing 3.75mug of haemagglutinin (HA) from the A/Indonesia/5/2005(IBCDC-RG2) clade 2.1 strain. A single booster dose of vaccine was administered to four groups primed 14 months previously with different HA levels of AS03(A)-adjuvanted clade 1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 H5N1 vaccine. Two booster doses (given 21 days apart) were administered to four groups primed 14 months previously with different HA levels of non-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 H5N1 vaccine and also to a control group of un-primed subjects. In individuals primed 14 months earlier with AS03(A)-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccines, a single booster dose of AS03(A)-adjuvanted A/Indonesia/5/2005 induced rapid immune responses (licensure criteria met in 7-14 days) comparable to that observed in the un-primed control group following two doses of adjuvanted vaccine. In contrast, individuals primed with non-adjuvanted formulations exhibited minimal immune responses which, even after two doses, were unexpectedly much lower than that observed in un-primed subjects. AS03(A) enhances the initial priming effect of pandemic influenza vaccination enabling a rapid humoral response to single dose boosting with a heterologous strain at 14 months. In contrast, priming without adjuvant appears to inhibit the response to subsequent vaccination with a heterologous strain. These findings should guide the development of vaccines to combat the present influenza A/H1N1 pandemic."

            "abstract": "Incidences of allergic disease have recently increased worldwide. Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) has long been a controversial treatment for allergic diseases. Although beneficial effects on clinically relevant outcomes have been demonstrated in clinical trials by subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), there remains a risk of severe and sometimes fatal anaphylaxis. Mucosal immunotherapy is one advantageous choice because of its non-injection routes of administration and lower side-effect profile. This study reviews recent progress in mucosal immunotherapy for allergic diseases. Administration routes, antigen quality and quantity, and adjuvants used are major considerations in this field. Also, direct uses of unique probiotics, or specific cytokines, have been discussed. Furthermore, some researchers have reported new therapeutic ideas that combine two or more strategies. The most important strategy for development of mucosal therapies for allergic diseases is the improvement of antigen formulation, which includes continuous searching for efficient adjuvants, collecting more information about dominant T-cell epitopes of allergens, and having the proper combination of each. In clinics, when compared to other mucosal routes, sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is a preferred choice for therapeutic administration, although local and systemic side effects have been reported. Additionally, not every allergen has the same beneficial effect. Further studies are needed to determine the benefits of mucosal immunotherapy for different allergic diseases after comparison of the different administration routes in children and adults. Data collected from large, well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized trials, with post-treatment follow-up, can provide robust substantiation of current evidence."

            "abstract": "The 11th Annual Conference on Vaccine Research, hosted by the National Foundation for Infectious Disease, attracted approximately 450 leaders in the fields of epidemiology, health economics, immunology and vaccinology, making it the largest scientific meeting devoted exclusively to vaccine research and technology. The conference highlighted recent advancements in vaccine design, including the discovery of new adjuvants, cytokines and regulatory pathways. Other topics included a comprehensive overview of the development and uses of cutaneous vaccination and a discussion of recently licensed vaccines against the human papillomavirus, herpes zoster virus, meningococcal disease and rotavirus and a discussion on the importance of redesigning and increasing the coverage of the influenza vaccine. Keynote remarks were provided by the demographer and economist David E Bloom (Harvard School of Public Health, USA), who argued that traditional economic evaluations of vaccine interventions have failed to account for the full range of benefits that can accrue from vaccination. These benefits are substantial in size and potentially decisive with respect to the bottom-line results of benefit-cost calculations."

Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to one of the four vaccination groups: the study group, topical imiquimod-cream followed by intradermal trivalent influenza vaccine (INF-Q-ID), or one of three control groups, topical aqueous-cream control followed by intradermal trivalent influenza vaccine (INF-C-ID), topical aqueous-cream control followed by intramuscular trivalent influenza vaccine (INF-C-IM), and topical imiquimod-cream followed by intradermal normal-saline injection (SAL-Q-ID). Randomisation was by computer-generated lists in blocks of four. The type of topical treatment was masked from volunteers and investigators, although not from the study nurse. Serum haemagglutination-inhibition and microneutralisation-antibody titres were assayed. The primary outcome was seroconversion at day 7 after treatment for three vaccine strains of influenza (A/California/07/2009 H1N1-like virus [A/California/H1N1], A/Victoria/361/2011 H3N2-like virus [A/Victoria/H3N2], and B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like virus [B/Yamagata lineage]) and four non-vaccine strains (A/HK/485197/14 [H3N2 Switzerland-like lineage], prototype A/WSN/1933 [H1N1], A/HK/408027/09 [prepandemic seasonal H1N1], and B/HK/418078/11 [Victoria lineage]).

Adverse reactions were infrequent and self-limited and did not differ between the four groups. Furthermore, the seroconversion rate against the four non-vaccine strains was better in the INF-Q-ID group than in the control groups on days 7 and 21 (p<0·0001). The most common adverse events were grade 1 redness (five participants in the INF-Q-ID group, three in INF-C-ID, one in INF-C-IM, and one in SAL-Q-ID) and grade 1 swelling (seven participants in INF-Q-ID group, five in INF-C-ID, three in INF-C-IM, and two in SAL-Q-ID.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Topical application of imiquimod before intradermal trivalent influenza vaccine significantly improved immunogenicity against the vaccine influenza strains in young healthy individuals and increased immunogenicity against the non-vaccine strains, especially the antigenically drifted H3N2 strain of 2015, which was not included in the 2013-14 recommended vaccine.

The confluence of a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus and the widespread absence of pre-existing immunity has driven the search for effective strategies for immunization in the face of a lethal pandemic. The potent adjuvant, heat labile enterotoxin from E. coli (LT), placed over the immunization site in a patch, is a novel adjuvant strategy for immune enhancement, and was evaluated using an H5N1 injectable vaccine.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this observer-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, 500 healthy adults 18-49 years of age were randomized to receive two intramuscular doses of A/Vietnam/1194/2004 A/H5N1 vaccine (5microg, 15microg or 45microg) or placebo (saline) 21 days apart. For each of the influenza vaccine doses, a 50microg LT adjuvant patch was applied over the injection site at either the second or both immunizations and the HI responses (titers) were compared to H5N1 vaccine alone. The study's primary endpoint was safety, and secondary immunogenicity endpoints were evaluated using European (CHMP) licensure criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The vaccine was safe and well tolerated, and subjects generally lacked pre-existing H5N1 immunity. The single-dose injection 45microg HA/LT patch regimen met all CHMP licensure criteria, including a 73% seroprotection rate compared to 49% seroprotection without a patch. Significant adjuvant effects were seen at all HA doses on Day 21. By contrast, only modest adjuvant effects were observed with the boosting regimen in subjects first primed with H5N1 alone and given the adjuvant patch only on the second immunization. The two-injection/two-patch 45microg HA regimen achieved significantly higher titers and GMFR compared to injection alone (GMFR 33.1 vs. 16.9, HI 226 vs. 94, p<0.05) and a 94% seroprotection rate.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The LT adjuvant patch placed over the injection site was safe, significantly enhanced the immune response to an H5N1 candidate vaccine, and achieved a 73% seroprotection rate after a single dose. The LT adjuvant patch has more modest benefits in recently primed populations similar to other candidate vaccine adjuvants, but a two-dose patch plus injection regimen resulted in robust HI responses."

Participants received two injections (D0, D21) of 7.5 microg hemagglutinin without adjuvant or 30 microg with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. Antibody responses and cytokine secretion were assessed before and after vaccination. Excluding the 6/300 non-elderly and 47/300 elderly participants with pre-existing antibodies, geometric mean titers (dil(-1)) on D42 were higher with 30 microg+Ad and were comparable between age groups. Participants with pre-existing antibodies responded strongly to the first vaccination (GMTs in the range 147-228 on D21). Vaccination increased both Th1 and Th2 T-cell responses. The predominantly Th1 profile observed before vaccination was unaffected by vaccination. H5N1 influenza vaccine is no less immunogenic in elderly adults than in younger adults and, due to a higher proportion non-naïve elderly, immunogenicity was higher in this latter group."

            "abstract": "Although most pathogens use the mucosal routes for invasion, the majority of currently available vaccines are administered parenterally. Injectable vaccines induce good systemic immunity but often unsatisfactory mucosal immunity. A non-injectable mucosal vaccine, which can be self-administered intranasally, may provide both effective systemic and mucosal immunity and can be used for vaccination of large populations within a short period of time in case of a sudden epidemic. Here, we report on a new intranasal (i.n.) influenza vaccine, based on a novel polycationic sphingolipid, N-palmitoyl D-erythro-sphingosyl carbamoyl-spermine (ceramide carbamoyl-spermine = CCS), having combined carrier and adjuvant activities, which elicits, in mice, strong systemic (serum) and local (lung and nasal) humoral and cellular responses, and provides protective immunity. In a comparative study, we show that both unmodified commercial vaccine and vaccine formulated with neutral or anionic liposomes were poorly immunogenic upon i.n. administration. Of five vaccine formulations based on well-established monocationic lipids in the form of unsized liposomes, three (DC-Chol, DDAB, and DSTAP-based) resulted in low serum and local responses, while two others (DMTAP and DOTAP-based vaccines) induced both systemic and local vigorous Th1+Th2 immune responses. However, only the vaccine formulated with CCS was equivalent or superior to the commercial vaccine co-administered with cholera toxin as an adjuvant. Furthermore, the CCS-based influenza vaccine was highly efficacious following a single or a repeated (x2) i.n. or a single i.m. administration, without an added adjuvant, in both young (2 months) and old (18 months) mice. It elicited high titers of strain cross-reactive hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies, and the high antibody titers and protective immunity persisted for at least 9 months. No systemic adverse effects, and only a mild local inflammatory response, were observed in mice and rabbits vaccinated i.n. with the CCS vaccine formulation. A similar approach may prove efficacious for i.n. vaccination against other pathogens."

Participants were allocated in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive TIV (full-dose for all age groups), adjuvanted TIV (aTIV), or placebo. Participants were stratified into age groups: 6-11, 12-35, and 36-71 months. All participants were vaccine-naïve and received two doses of study vaccine 4 weeks apart. The two independent primary objectives were to estimate the immunogenicity of TIV and of aTIV as the proportion of children with a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer of ≥1:40 to each vaccine strain at 28 days post-dose two. Safety was evaluated by solicited local and systemic reactions, unsolicited adverse events, and serious adverse events.\n## RESULTS\n296 children received TIV, aTIV, or placebo, and 235 were included in the final analysis. After two doses, children aged 6-11, 12-35, and 36-71 months receiving TIV had HI titers ≥1:40 against A/H1N1 (73.1%, 94.1%, and 97.0%), A/H3N2 (96.2%, 100.0%, and 100.0%), and B (80.8%, 97.1%, and 97.0%), respectively. After two doses, 100% children aged 6-11, 12-35, and 36-71 months receiving aTIV had ≥1:40 titers against A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B. After a single dose, the aTIV response was comparable to or greater than the TIV response for all vaccine strains. TIV and aTIV reactogenicity were similar, except for mild elevation in temperature (37.5-38.4 °C) which occurred more frequently in aTIV than TIV after each vaccine dose. TIV and aTIV had similarly increased pain/tenderness at the injection site compared to placebo.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBoth aTIV and full-dose TIV were well-tolerated and immunogenic in children aged 6-71 months. These vaccines may play a role in programmatically suitable strategies to prevent influenza in low-resource settings.\n"

            "abstract": "Traditionally, inactivated influenza vaccines have all been treated as virtually identical, at least in terms of recommendations for use. This has mostly been the case since their development over 60 years ago. The concept, still often quoted, that they are 70-90% protective against laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza comes from multiple studies carried out with different preparations in the US military; studies which ended in 1969 [1]. During this period, there were only gradual advances in improved potency and purity of the vaccines, so that it was appropriate to consider them as being comparable. However, we are currently witnessing a change, which started slowly, but is now accelerating, in which very different types of vaccine are becoming available. This has already begun in some parts of the world, but will soon be universal. The process is being accelerated by questions concerning the actual effectiveness of the current vaccines in specific risk groups. In this paper, we will take a look at the developments in the formulation of the vaccine to address the needs that have been identified. We will also consider different strategies for vaccine use which might be applied to traditional or future vaccines to improve population protection."

Each patient received a precoded 40-g tube and instructions on how to apply the trial medication to their lesions at home two times daily for five consecutive days per week. The active treatment period was six weeks. Patients were evaluated on a weekly basis. A clinically and PCR established total clearance of target warts was recorded as a cure. By the end of the treatment, 43.3% of patients and 42.8% of warts were cured. Code disclosure revealed that imiquimod cream had cured 83.3% of the treated patients and 84.3% of the tested warts, while the placebo healed one subject and four warts (p < 0.0001). Eight patients (13.3%) in the imiquimod group experienced mild to moderate, non-objective, drug-induced symptoms with no dropouts. Among the 26 cured patients, five had a relapse after 11 months.

            "abstract": "Vaccination against influenza is considered to be one of the key interventions in case of a pandemic. Unfortunately, shortages in vaccine supplies will occur because of the substantial increase in vaccine demands worldwide and the limited available supply resources. The recommended use of monovalent--instead of current trivalent--vaccines containing 15 micro g hemagglutinin (HA) per dose can theoretically triple vaccine volumes but is unlikely to meet the demand. Furthermore, previous experiences demonstrated that one dose of 15 micro g HA will not be sufficient to elicit protective antibody levels in unprimed individuals. Modified formulation approaches were investigated, that would be suitable to provide significantly higher volumes of potent vaccine within a given period of time. Low doses of HA combined with aluminum (Al) adjuvants and the use of whole virus instead of split or subunit antigens can lead to substantial increases in process yield. In addition, production of whole virus vaccines will reduce manufacturing complexity. In a dose-finding study in healthy adults and elderly, immune responses after administration of Al-adjuvanted low-dose formulations were compared to a standard split virus vaccine (Fluarix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium). All vaccines were safe and well tolerated. Antigen concentrations as low as 1.9 micro g HA/strain per dose of adjuvant-containing experimental vaccines induced protective antibody levels in primed populations. Reactogenicity profiles of Al-adjuvanted low-dose vaccines were investigated in a feasibility trial. Neither the use of Al-adjuvant nor of whole virus had a significant effect on general reactions. Studies in unprimed populations with H2N2 and H9N2 candidate vaccines showed different results, with a potential need for a two-dose schedule. Indeed, hemagglutination inhibition titers did not reach protective levels after a single vaccine dose but could be met following administration of a second dose. The same is true for Al-adjuvanted whole virus formulations with an up to eightfold-reduced antigen content. It may be concluded that the use of Al-adjuvanted whole virus vaccines with low HA content can raise protective antibody levels after two vaccine doses, which may, in turn, result in significant increases of vaccine supplies in the case of a pandemic."

            "abstract": "Most FDA-approved adjuvants for infectious agents boost humoral but not cellular immunity, and have poorly-understood mechanisms. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING, also known as MITA, MPYS, or ERIS) is an exciting adjuvant target due to its role in cyclic dinucleotide (CDN)-driven anti-viral immunity; however, a major hindrance is STING's cytosolic localization which requires intracellular delivery of its agonists. As a result, STING agonists administered in a soluble form have elicited suboptimal immune responses. Delivery of STING agonists via particle platforms has proven a more successful strategy, but the opportunity for improved formulations and bioactivity remains. In this study we evaluated the adjuvant activity of the potent STING agonist, CDN 3'3'-cGAMP (cGAMP), encapsulated in acid-sensitive acetalated dextran (Ace-DEX) polymeric microparticles (MPs) which passively target antigen-presenting cells for intracellular release. This formulation was superior to all particle delivery systems evaluated and maintained its bioactivity following a sterilizing dose of gamma irradiation. Compared to soluble cGAMP, the Ace-DEX cGAMP MPs enhanced type-I interferon responses nearly 1000-fold in vitro and 50-fold in vivo, caused up to a 104-fold boost in antibody titers, increased Th1-associated responses, and expanded germinal center B cells and memory T cells. Furthermore, the encapsulated cGAMP elicited no observable toxicity in animals and achieved protective immunity against a lethal influenza challenge seven months post-immunization when using CDN adjuvant doses up to 100-fold lower than previous reports. For these reasons, Ace-DEX MP-encapsulated cGAMP represents a potent vaccine adjuvant of humoral and cellular immunity."

            "abstract": "In randomized clinical trials comparing treatment effects on diseases such as cancer, a multi-centre trial is usually conducted to accrue the required number of patients in a reasonable period of time. While we interpret the average treatment effect, it is necessary to examine the homogeneity of the observed treatment effects across institutions, that is, treatment-by-institution interaction. If the homogeneity is confirmed, the conclusions concerning treatment effects can be generalized to a broader patient population. In this paper, a Bayesian hierarchical survival model is used to investigate the institutional effects on the efficacy of treatment as well as on the baseline risk. The marginal posterior distributions are estimated by a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, that is, Gibbs sampling, to overcome current computational limitations. The robustness of the inferences to the distributional assumption for the random effects is also examined. We illustrate the methods with analyses of data from a multi-centre cancer clinical trial, which investigated the efficacy of immunochemotherapy as an adjuvant treatment after curative resection of gastric cancer. In this trial there is little difference in the treatment effects across institutions and the treatment is shown to be effective, while there appears to be substantial variation in the baseline risk across institutions. This result indicates that the observed treatment effects might be generalized to a broader patient population."

            "abstract": "With interleukins (IL), a new class of potential drugs has been introduced into clinical research. These signal peptides are involved in the regulation of many physiological and pathophysiological processes. IL-1, -2, -3, -4, -6 and -11 have been tested in clinical trials. The growth promoting, growth inhibiting or immunomodulatory activities of interleukins represent the theoretical basis for large scale clinical testing, predominantly in malignant disease. Dose-dependent effects on numbers of peripheral blood cells and recovery from bone marrow failure have been demonstrated for IL-1, -3, -6 and -11. Phase III trials are in progress to determine their value for clinical practice. However, investigations on the immunomodulatory activities proved to be more difficult. This is because key mechanisms for successful treatment of malignant disease by immunomodulation are not clearly defined and the methodology for assessment of immunostimulatory effects is not well established. Besides treatment of renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma with IL-2, no successful trials have been reported. However, phase I clinical trials with IL-1, IL-4 and IL-6 have just been completed. Thus, it seems too early to conclude on their therapeutic potential."

            "abstract": "Reprogramming the tumor microenvironment to increase immune-mediated responses is currently of intense interest. Patients with immune-infiltrated \"hot\" tumors demonstrate higher treatment response rates and improved survival. However, only the minority of tumors are hot, and a limited proportion of patients benefit from immunotherapies. Innovative approaches that make tumors hot can have immediate impact particularly if they repurpose drugs with additional cancer-unrelated benefits. The seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended for all persons over 6 mo without prohibitive contraindications, including most cancer patients. Here, we report that unadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccination via intratumoral, but not intramuscular, injection converts \"cold\" tumors to hot, generates systemic CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity, and sensitizes resistant tumors to checkpoint blockade. Importantly, intratumoral vaccination also provides protection against subsequent active influenza virus lung infection. Surprisingly, a squalene-based adjuvanted vaccine maintains intratumoral regulatory B cells and fails to improve antitumor responses, even while protecting against active influenza virus lung infection. Adjuvant removal, B cell depletion, or IL-10 blockade recovers its antitumor effectiveness. Our findings propose that antipathogen vaccines may be utilized for both infection prevention and repurposing as a cancer immunotherapy."

We evaluated the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of different formulations of cell-derived MF59-adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted A/H1N1 influenza vaccine in children and adolescents. This was a randomized, single-blind, multicenter study with a total of 666 healthy subjects aged 6 months-17 y in one of 3 vaccination groups, each receiving formulations containing different amounts of influenza A/H1N1 antigen with or without MF59. A booster trivalent seasonal MF59 vaccine was administered one year after primary vaccinations. Antibody titers were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization assays obtained on days 1, 22, 43, 366, and 387 (3 weeks post booster). Safety was monitored throughout the study. One vaccination with 3.75 μg of A/H1N1 antigen formulated with 50% MF59 (3.75_halfMF59) or 7.5 μg of A/H1N1 antigen formulated with 100% MF59 (7.5_fullMF59) induced an HI titer ≥1:40 in >70% of children in the 1-<3, 3-8, and 9-17 y cohorts; however, 2 vaccinations with nonadjuvanted 15 μg A/H1N1 antigen were needed to achieve this response in the 1-<3 and 3-8 y cohorts. Among children aged 6-11 months, 1 dose of 7.5_fullMF59 resulted in an HI titer ≥1:40 in >70% while 2 doses of 3.75_halfMF59 were required to achieve this result. All vaccines were well tolerated. Our findings support the immunogenicity and safety of the 3.75_halfMF59 (2 doses for children <12 months) and 7.5_fullMF59 vaccine formulations for use in children and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 y The use of the 3.75_halfMF59 could have the benefit of antigen and adjuvant sparing, increasing the available vaccine doses allowing vaccination of more people.\n"

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of CHM combined with conventional chemotherapy (CT) in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Publications in 11 electronic databases were extensively searched, and 24 trials were included for analysis. A sum of 2,109 patients was enrolled in these studies, at which 1,064 patients participated in CT combined CHM and 1,039 in CT (six patients dropped out and were not reported the group enrolled). Compared to using CT alone, CHM combined with CT significantly increase one-year survival rate (RR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.15-1.60, p = 0.0003). Besides, the combined therapy significantly increased immediate tumor response (RR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.19-1.56, p<1.0E-5) and improved Karnofsky performance score (KPS) (RR = 2.90, 95% CI = 1.62-5.18, p = 0.0003). Combined therapy remarkably reduced the nausea and vomiting at toxicity grade of III-IV (RR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.12-0.50, p = 0.0001) and prevented the decline of hemoglobin and platelet in patients under CT at toxicity grade of I-IV (RR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.51-0.80, p<0.0001). Moreover, the herbs that are frequently used in NSCLC patients were identified. This systematic review suggests that CHM as an adjuvant therapy can reduce CT toxicity, prolong survival rate, enhance immediate tumor response, and improve KPS in advanced NSCLC patients. However, due to the lack of large-scale randomized clinical trials in the included studies, further larger scale trials are needed."

Aligning our studies with the adjuvanted proteins evaluated in a prime-boost schedule with ALVAC in the ongoing HVTN (HIV Vaccine Trials Network) 702 efficacy trial, we selected the bivalent clade C Env immunogens gp120 C.1086 and gp120 TV1 in combination with the MF59 adjuvant. However, we hypothesized that the adjuvant system AS01, that is included in the pediatric RTS,S malaria vaccine, would promote Env-specific antibody responses superior to those of the oil-in-water MF59 emulsion adjuvant. In a second study arm, we compared two emulsions, glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant formulated in a stable emulsion (GLA-SE) and 3M-052-SE, containing Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and TLR7/TLR8 (TLR7/8) ligand, respectively. The latter adjuvant had been previously demonstrated to be especially effective in activating neonatal antigen-presenting cells. Our results demonstrate that different adjuvants drive quantitatively or qualitatively distinct responses to the bivalent Env vaccine. AS01 induced higher Env-specific plasma IgG antibody levels than the antigen in MF59 and promoted improved antibody function in infants, and 3M-052-SE outperformed GLA-SE by inducing the highest breadth and functionality of antibody responses. Thus, distinct adjuvants are likely to be required for maximizing vaccine-elicited immune responses in infants, particularly when immunization in infancy aims to elicit both perinatal and lifelong immunity against challenging pathogens such as HIV.IMPORTANCE Alum remains the adjuvant of choice for pediatric vaccines. Yet the distinct nature of the developing immune system in infants likely requires novel adjuvants targeted specifically at the pediatric population to reach maximal vaccine efficacy with an acceptable safety profile. The current study supports the idea that additional adjuvants for pediatric vaccines should be, and need to be, tested in infants for their potential to enhance immune responses. Using an infant macaque model, our results suggest that both AS01 and 3M-052-SE can significantly improve and better sustain HIV Env-specific antibody responses than alum. Despite the limited number of animals, the results revealed interesting differences that warrant further testing of promising novel adjuvant candidates in larger preclinical and clinical studies to define the mechanisms leading to adjuvant-improved antibody responses and to identify targets for adjuvant and vaccine optimization."

The clinical course of acute infections was favourable both in placebo and in treatment group, but recovery was quicker with pidotimod than with placebo. Antibiotic therapy and time of hospitalization were shorter in the patients taking pidotimod, and main symptomatic parameters (pharyngalgia, dysphagia, mucous membrane inflammation, adenopathy, anorexia) receded quickly. In patients receiving the drug as well as in placebo group changes in laboratory parameters, indicating recovery from the acute infectious events, were observed. A significant trend to normalization of the immune response, evidenced by chemotaxis and leukocyte phagocytosis index, was found only in patients treated with pidotimod. A significant decrease in the risk of relapses was observed in patients treated with pidotimod (35%), as well as a reduction of hospitalization (86%) and a decreased antibiotic therapy (47%). If a relapse occurred, the response of treated patients was quicker (fever, antibiotic therapy, hospitalization). These findings allow to correlate the individual immune response activation to the resistance to recurrent infections and also to a better response to therapy in case of clinically relevant disease. No side effects were observed. Only in 12 patients (5 pidotimod, 7 placebo) mild reactions were observed, but they were attributed to concomitant antibiotic treatment or other factors.

Investigated was the effect of treatment with active vitamin D on the prevention of posttransplantation bone loss. Forty adult men who were recent renal transplant recipients were enrolled onto the study. Patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 received daily alfacalcidol 0.5 micro g by mouth, and group 2 (control) received placebo. Every patient in both groups received daily 500-mg calcium carbonate supplements. Parameters of bone metabolism and bone mineral density measured at three sites were assessed before and after the study period. Bone mineral density was increased by 2.1%, 1.8%, and 3.2% at lumbar spine, femoral neck, and forearm, respectively, in group 1, whereas it decreased by 3.2%, 3.8%, and 1.8% at the same sites in the control group (P < 0.05). Serum intact parathyroid hormone level decreased significantly in group 1 compared with the control group (P = 0.003). Early bone loss that occurs during the first 1 yr after renal transplantation could be prevented by alfacalcidol. Use of alfacalcidol early after transplantation is safe and well tolerated."

The formulations were administered by intramuscular (IM) (2 inoculations - at baseline and after 14 days) and intranasal (IN) (3 inoculations at 7 days) immunization pathways. All IM immunized groups were able to induce similar response to these formulations as well as to VA-MENGOC-BC® vaccine - containing Al(OH)3 adjuvant (used as positive control of the trial). In all groups, the induced inflammation (IP) rate was statistically higher than in the negative control group (CN) (p < 0.05). Immunogenicity, measured by HSR and CD4+ lymphocyte increase was equivalent to the control vaccine and most important, granuloma reactogenicity at the site of injection was eliminated, fact demonstrated by histological study. All groups of animals immunized by IN route showed HSR reactions and statistically significant differences with respect to the CN group. However, IP values were lower, with statistical differences (p < 0.05) for the same adjuvant formulation IM administered, except the AIF2-nCh formulation that generated statistically similar induction (p > 0.05) by both immunization pathways, suggesting it to be the best candidate for the next IN trial. Proteoliposome and cochleate formulations tested were able to mount potent Th-1 immune response, equivalent to the original vaccine formulation, with the advantage of less reactogenicity in the site of the injection, caused by the toxicity of Al(OH)3 adjuvant gel."

The literature on the cost effectiveness of these is often confusing and contradictory. There is a lack of quality evidence enabling the comparison of different DMTs. There are scarce randomized controlled trials which look at one DMT compared with another that is not IFN or GA. There is also a lack of systematic reviews comparing the efficacy and safety of different DMTs. This makes it difficult to perform good quality cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs). Furthermore, CEAs in and of themselves are difficult to interpret or compare due to the variation in methods and cost estimations as well as the use of outcome measures which cannot be proven over a reasonable timeframe. This review looks at the different DMTs available for MS and attempts to draw some conclusions on their cost-effectiveness. It also considers the costs and benefits of front loading the cost of treatment for MS by using more expensive and effective treatment earlier on."

The past decade has seen significant progress in developing new vaccine candidates, but the most fundamental questions in understanding disease progression and protective host responses that are responsible for controlling Mtb infection still remain poorly resolved. Current TB treatment requires intense chemotherapy with several antimicrobials, while the only approved vaccine is the classical viable whole-cell based Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) that protects children from severe forms of TB, but fails to protect adults. Taken together, there is a growing need to conduct basic and applied research to develop novel vaccine strategies against TB. This review is focused on the discussion surrounding current strategies and innovations being explored to discover new protective antigens, adjuvants, and delivery systems in the hopes of creating an efficacious TB vaccine."

At present there is no approved vaccine for individuals below the age of six months given previous studies showing a failure of these individuals to efficiently seroconvert. Given the major impact of influenza on infant health, it is critical that we develop vaccines that will be safe and effective in this population. Using a nonhuman primate (NHP) model, we have evaluated the ability of an inactivated influenza virus vaccine adjuvanted with flagellin to result in long term immune responses in neonates. To evaluate this critical attribute, neonate NHP were vaccinated and boosted with inactivated influenza virus in combination with either flagellin or a mutant inactive flagellin control. Our studies show that inclusion of flagellin resulted in a significant increase (5-fold, p=0.04) in influenza virus-specific IgG antibody at 6months post-vaccination. In addition, the antibody present at this late time was of higher affinity (2.4-fold, p=0.02). Finally a greater percentage of infants had detectable neutralizing antibody. These results support the use of flagellin in neonates as an adjuvant that promotes long-lived, high affinity antibody responses."

In this dose-ranging, factorial design trial, we report the safety and immunogenicity of different combinations of adjuvanted (ATIV) and non-adjuvanted trivalent (TIV) and quadrivalent (QIV) influenza vaccines in 480 healthy children 6 to <36 months of age. The results show that the second B strain added to TIV was immunogenic and did not affect immunogenicity of the other strains. The addition of the MF59(®) adjuvant promoted robust immune responses with notable elevations in antibodies observed even after one dose. A dose-response relationship was observed between the antibody response and MF59 adjuvant. No patterns in safety and tolerability emerged with different adjuvant and antigen doses nor with the addition of a second B strain. MF59-adjuvanted QIV offers potential advantages to young children."

            "abstract": "The emergence of a new influenza A virus (H1N1) variant in 2009 led to a worldwide vaccination program, which was prepared in a relatively short period of time. This study investigated the humoral immunity against this virus before and after vaccination with a 2009 influenza A virus (H1N1) monovalent MF59-adjuvanted vaccine, as well as the persistence of vaccine-induced antibodies. Our prospective longitudinal study included 498 health care workers (mean age, 43 years; median age, 44 years). Most (89%) had never or only occasionally received a seasonal influenza virus vaccine, and 11% were vaccinated annually (on average, for >10 years). Antibody titers were determined by a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay at baseline, 3 weeks after the first vaccination, and 5 weeks and 7 months after the second vaccination. Four hundred thirty-five persons received two doses of the 2009 vaccine. After the first dose, 79.5% developed a HI titer of ≥40. This percentage increased to 83.3% after the second dose. Persistent antibodies were found in 71.9% of the group that had not received annual vaccinations and in 43.8% of the group that had received annual vaccinations. The latter group tended to have lower HI titers (P=0.09). With increasing age, HI titers decreased significantly, by 2.4% per year. A single dose of the 2009 vaccine was immunogenic in almost 80% of the study population, whereas an additional dose resulted in significantly increased titers only in persons over 50. Finally, a reduced HI antibody response against the 2009 vaccine was found in adults who had previously received seasonal influenza virus vaccination. More studies on the effect of yearly seasonal influenza virus vaccination on the immune response are warranted."

            "abstract": "Oil-in-water adjuvants have been shown to improve immune responses against pandemic influenza vaccines as well as reduce the effective vaccine dose, increasing the number of doses available to meet global vaccine demand. Here, we use genome fragment phage display libraries and surface plasmon resonance to elucidate the effects of MF59 on the quantity, diversity, specificity, and affinity maturation of human antibody responses to the swine-origin H1N1 vaccine in different age groups. In adults and children, MF59 selectively enhanced antibody responses to the hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) globular head relative to the more conserved HA2 domain in terms of increased antibody titers as well as a more diverse antibody epitope repertoire. Antibody affinity, as inferred by greatly diminished (≥10-fold) off-rate constants, was significantly increased in toddlers and children who received the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine. Moreover, MF59 also improved antibody affinity maturation after each sequential vaccination against avian H5N1 in adults. For both pandemic influenza vaccines, there was a close correlation between serum antibody affinity and virus-neutralizing capacity. Thus, MF59 quantitatively and qualitatively enhances functional antibody responses to HA-based vaccines by improving both epitope breadth and binding affinity, demonstrating the added value of such adjuvants for influenza vaccines."

The relation between outcome and the following clinical characteristics was also studied: sex, age, range of motion for maximal mouth opening, TMJ pain, TMJ noise, tenderness of masticatory muscles, locking duration, intercuspal occlusions, angle of posterior slope of articular eminence and degenerative bony changes of the condyle. Logistic regression analysis revealed that pumping with injection of sodium hyaluronate was related to a good outcome. Clinical characteristics of presentation significantly related to a good outcome were a large maximal mouth opening, a short locking duration, and a steep posterior slope of articular eminence.

            "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have linked fish oil consumption to a decreased incidence of cancer. The anticancer effects of fish oil are mostly attributed to its content of omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). However, DHA, because of its unique effect of altering membrane composition, is often regarded as the major omega-3 fatty acid involved in anticancer activity. Although use of DHA as an anticancer drug to prevent or treat human cancer in clinical settings has not yet been well established, recent studies suggest that DHA can be very effective as an adjuvant with other anticancer agents. In this article, we present studies that show the role of DHA in improving anticancer drug efficacy. Several in vitro and animal studies suggest that combining DHA with other anticancer agents often improves efficacy of anticancer drugs and also reduces therapy-associated side effects. Incorporation of DHA in cellular membranes improves drug uptake, whereas increased lipid peroxidation is another mechanism for DHA-mediated enhanced efficacy of anticancer drugs. In addition, several intracellular targets including cyclooxygenase-2, nuclear factor kappa B, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, mitogen-activated protein kinase, AKT, and BCL-2/BAX are found to play an important role in DHA-mediated additive or synergistic interaction with anticancer drugs. The data suggest that DHA is a safe, natural compound that can greatly improve the anticancer properties of anticancer drugs. Use of DHA with anticancer treatments provides an avenue to therapeutic improvement that involves less risk or side effects for patients and reduced regulatory burden for implementation."

Available evidence suggests that no single vaccine type is universally appropriate; rather, different types may be more appropriate for different population strata. However, while the concept of appropriateness/preferential use of single vaccines is usually adopted at the central level, little is known about the attitudes of physicians on the matter. A pilot survey of Italian physicians (N = 372) revealed that most (about 90%) were aware that the available vaccines were different, and that particular vaccines were more appropriate for specific groups. The availability of explicit guidelines on which vaccine to administer to a given population group was deemed desirable by 93.2% of respondents. The results were consistent with the 2018 Italian and UK normative documents, which indicate adjuvanted vaccines as the most appropriate choice for the elderly, and quadrivalent formulations for the younger age-classes.

Clinical data have highlighted the role of adjuvants in improving vaccine efficacy. As uremic patients are especially vulnerable to infections, it is recommended that they should be vaccinated yearly against influenza. This paper presents the results of a pilot clinical trial, conducted in hemodialyzed patients with an adjuvated pandemic H1N1v influenza vaccine alone and combined with Thymosin-alpha 1.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Subjects were subdivided into 3 treatment groups receiving: the adjuvated pandemic influenza vaccine (Focetria) only (first treatment group), and the Vaccine+Thymosin alpha 1 (Zadaxin) at a dose of 3.2 and 6.4 mg (second and third treatment groups respectively). The immunoresponse was assessed on days 0, 21, 42, 84 and 168 after vaccine administration by means of Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI), Microneutralization (MN) and Single Radial Hemolysis (SRH) assays. The CHMP regards HI as the gold standard test to evaluate the immune response to influenza vaccines before influenza vaccines are licensed. The CHMP criteria are slightly different in adults (18-60-year-old subjects) and the elderly (>60 years old). Indeed, 40% of seroconversion, 70% of subjects seroprotected 21 days after vaccination, and a 2.5-fold increase in GMR (Geometric Mean Ratio) are required in adults, while in the elderly, the corresponding threshold values are: 30%, 60% and a 2-fold increase. All these criteria must be met for the licensing of a pandemic influenza vaccine. Safety evaluation was performed by means of Adverse Event (AE) recording, laboratory assays (hematology and chemistry), electrocardiogram, and assessment of vital signs.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Three populations were considered: Intention-To-Treat (ITT) (94 patients), Per Protocol (PP) (82 patients), and Safety population (99 patients). With regard to the Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) and the Geometric Mean Ratio (GMR) of HI on Day 21 in the ITT population, both \"Vaccine+Thymosin alpha 1\" groups presented better results than the \"Vaccine only\" group. A large proportion of ITT patients in the two Vaccine+Thymosin alpha 1 groups achieved seroconversion by Day 21. On Day 42, the decrease in the GMT of HI was greater in the Vaccine+Thymosin alpha 1 groups than in the vaccine only group. Similar results were obtained in the PP population. The CHMP criteria were fully met in the groups treated with Vaccine+Thymosin alpha 1. No AE was found to be related to Thymosin alpha 1 nor to the Focetria vaccine.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although further studies in larger hemodialyzed populations are necessary, it can be concluded that Thymosin alpha 1 enhanced the immunogenicity of the pandemic influenza vaccine used.

The 2009 H1N1/2009pdm 'swine flu' pandemic reinforced the need for innovation in pandemic vaccine design. We report on insights gained during rapid development of a pandemic vaccine based on recombinant haemagglutinin (rHA) formulated with Advax™ delta inulin adjuvant (Panblok-H1/Advax). Panblok-H1/Advax was designed and manufactured within 1 month of the pandemic declaration by WHO and successfully entered human clinical testing in under 3 months from first isolation and sequencing of the novel pandemic virus, requiring several major challenges to be overcome. Panblok-H1/Advax successfully induced neutralising antibodies against the pandemic strain, but also induced cross-neutralising antibodies in a subset of subjects against an H1N1 strain (A/Puerto Rico/8/34) derived from the 1918 Spanish flu, highlighting the possibility to use Advax to induce more broadly cross-protective antibody responses. Interestingly, the rHA from H1N1/2009pdm exhibited variants in the receptor binding domain that had a major impact on receptor binding and hemagglutination ability. We used an in silico structural modeling approach to better understand the unusual behavior of the novel hemagglutinin, thereby demonstrating the power of computational modeling approaches for rapid characterization of new pandemic viruses. While challenges remain in ensuring ultrafast vaccine access for the entire population in response to future pandemics, the adjuvanted recombinant Panblok-H1/Advax vaccine proved its utility during a real-life pandemic situation."

One strategy to prevent these congenital defects is prophylactic vaccination in young women. A candidate vaccine antigen is glycoprotein B (gB). This antigen is abundant on the virion surface and is a major target of neutralization responses in human infections. Here, we have evaluated in a challenge model of congenital guinea pig CMV (GPCMV) infection, GPCMV-gB vaccines formulated with the clinically relevant Adjuvant Systems AS01B and AS02V, or with Freund's adjuvant (FA). Fifty-two GPCMV-seronegative female guinea pigs were administered three vaccine doses before being mated. GPCMV-challenge was performed at Day 45 of pregnancy (of an estimated 65 day gestation). Pup mortality rates in the gB/AS01B, gB/AS02V, and gB/FA groups were 24% (8/34), 10% (4/39) and 36% (12/33), respectively, and in the unvaccinated control group was 65% (37/57). Hence, efficacies against pup mortality were estimated at 64%, 84% and 44% for gB/AS01B (p<0.001), gB/AS02V (p<0.001) and gB/FA (p=0.014), respectively. Efficacies against GPCMV viremia (i.e. DNAemia, detected by PCR) were estimated at 88%, 68% and 25% for the same vaccines, respectively, but were only significant for gB/AS01B (p<0.001), and gB/AS02V (p=0.002). In dams with viremia, viral load was approximately 6-fold lower with vaccination than without. All vaccines were highly immunogenic after two and three doses. In light of these results and of other results of AS01-adjuvanted vaccines in clinical development, vaccine immunogenicity was further explored using human CMV-derived gB antigen adjuvanted with either AS01B or the related formulation AS01E. Both adjuvanted vaccines were highly immunogenic after two doses, in contrast to the lower immunogenicity of the unadjuvanted vaccine. In conclusion, the protective efficacy and immunogenicity of adjuvanted vaccines in this guinea pig model are supportive of investigating gB/AS01 and gB/AS02 in the clinic."

The use of Pidotimod determined a significant reduction of surgical tonsillectomy's treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This approach had a strong impact on the children's quality of life; a significant decrement in the use of antipyretic drugs, as well as a lower rate of antibiotic prescription, were also noted. It also had a dramatic impact on families' lives, because the treatment lowers the number of absences of family members from work or school/kindergarten."

The model was parameterized using vaccine efficacy data from randomized clinical trials and up-to-date incidence, costs and health-related quality of life data from national datasets. We used a time horizon of 15 years, and the analysis was conducted from the societal perspective.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At a coverage of 50%, vaccination with two doses of HZ/su was estimated to prevent 4335 to 10,896 HZ cases, depending on the cohort age. In comparison, this reduction was estimated at 400-4877 for ZVL and 427-6466 for ZVL with a booster. The maximum vaccine cost per series of HZ/su to remain cost-effective to a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained ranged from €109.09 for 70-year-olds to €63.68 for 50-year-olds. The cost-effectiveness of ZVL changed considerably by age, with corresponding maximum vaccine cost per dose ranging from €51.37 for 60-year-olds to €0.73 for 80-year-olds. Adding a ZVL booster after 10 years would require a substantial reduction of the maximum cost per dose to remain cost-effective as compared to ZVL single dose. Sensitivity analyses on the vaccine cost demonstrated that there were scenarios in which vaccination with either HZ/su (two doses), ZVL single dose or ZVL + booster could be the most cost-effective strategy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A strategy with two doses of HZ/su was superior in reducing the burden of HZ as compared to a single dose or single dose + booster of ZVL. Both vaccines could potentially be cost-effective to a conventional Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold for preventive interventions. However, whether HZ/su or ZVL would be the most cost-effective alternative depends largely on the vaccine cost."

            "abstract": "Traditional vaccination approaches (e.g. live attenuated or killed microorganisms) are among the most effective means to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. These approaches, nevertheless, have failed to yield successful vaccines against many important pathogens. To overcome this problem, methods have been developed to identify microbial components, against which protective immune responses can be elicited. Subunit antigens identified by these approaches enable the production of defined vaccines, with improved safety profiles. However, they are generally poorly immunogenic, necessitating their administration with potent immunostimulatory adjuvants. Since few safe and effective adjuvants are currently used in vaccines approved for human use, with those available displaying poor potency, or an inability to stimulate the types of immune responses required for vaccines against specific diseases (e.g. cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) to treat cancers), the development of new vaccines will be aided by the availability of characterized platforms of new adjuvants, improving our capacity to rationally select adjuvants for different applications. One such approach, involves the addition of microbial components (pathogen-associated molecular patterns; PAMPs), that can stimulate strong immune responses, into subunit vaccine formulations. The conjugation of PAMPs to subunit antigens provides a means to greatly increase vaccine potency, by targeting immunostimulation and antigen to the same antigen presenting cell. Thus, methods that enable the efficient, and inexpensive production of antigen-adjuvant fusions represent an exciting mean to improve immunity towards subunit antigens. Herein we review four protein-based adjuvants (flagellin, bacterial lipoproteins, the extra domain A of fibronectin (EDA), and heat shock proteins (Hsps)), which can be genetically fused to antigens to enable recombinant production of antigen-adjuvant fusion proteins, with a focus on their mechanisms of action, structural or sequence requirements for activity, sequence modifications to enhance their activity or simplify production, adverse effects, and examples of vaccines in preclinical or human clinical trials."

A total of 56 animals were divided into four groups of 14 each; an additional 10 were employed for blood transfusion (BT). Intestinal anastomoses were performed on all animals; the following postoperative treatments were administered: none (control group); BT; intra-abdominal (IA) levamisole; and BT + levamisole. After recording the mortality of each group, a relaparotomy was performed on one-half of the animals on the 3rd postoperative day and on the remaining half on the 7th postoperative day. Findings of IA sepsis, resistance of the anastomosis, bursting pressure, and hydroxyproline values were evaluated. Statistical comparison of the groups was accomplished by analysis of variance. In the transfused group an increase in sepsis was determined and the bursting pressure was significantly lower than in the control group. IA levamisole application following BT reduced the mortality by diminishing IA sepsis and anastomotic abscess formation and increased anastomotic pressure and recovery (P < 0.01). Histopathologic recovery in levamisole groups was better than in the group that received BT only. Levamisole application without BT resulted in equal mortality and morbidity to that of the control group. We conclude that clinical use of levamisole should be considered only in intestinal anastomoses in which BT is inevitable."

Animal reservoir for influenza viruses and repeatedly occurring human infections with avian influenza viruses since 1997 indicate that there is a real threat of pandemic, but it is no possible to predict when this outbreak begins. Every year 330-990 millions of people are ill due to influenza worldwide. In Poland there are registered from a few hundred to few millions of cases and suspected cases of influenza each epidemic season. WHO coordinates the international Global Influenza Surveillance Network consisting of international WHO reference centres for influenza in London, Atlanta, Tokyo, Melbourne and 115 national influenza centres in 86 countries all over the world. One of such National Influenza Centers is located in Poland at the National Institute of Hygiene in Warsaw Influenza surveillance provides information on the currently circulating strains of influenza viruses, including new variants and their spreading that allows to choose appropriate strains to include into the vaccine for the next epidemic season. Regional influenza surveillance networks also exist, as the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS). The epidemic season 2004/2005 was the first season when the integrated system of virological and epidemiological surveillance SENTINEL started to work in Poland, according to EISS indications. In this system there are included the selected family physicians representing the entire country, Voivodship Sanitary-Epidemiological Stations and the National Influenza Center. Data obtained by the SENTINEL system are then forwarded to EISS and WHO. Widely available way of prophylaxis against influenza is vaccination. Inactivated influenza vaccines prevent illness in 70%-90% healthy adults under 65 and in children. They also prevent post-influenza complications. Attenuated nasal influenza vaccines are registered to use in Russia and the United States. In Poland, vaccinations against influenza are considered in the Program of the Preventive Vaccinations as recommended since 1994. Vaccination against influenza is especially recommended for people who highly risk occurrence of post-influenza complications as well as for some groups of people due to epidemiological indications. Vaccine is administered before epidemic season, but it is also possible during the epidemic season when virus already circulates in the population. There are performed studies to improve currently vaccines, e.g. studies on the safe adjuvants (aluminium, MF59, virosoms), DNA vaccines, use of hemagglutinins and neuraminidase obtained by genetic recombination and expression in insect cells, studies on the production of influenza vaccines in the cell culture MDCK and Vero instead of currently used chicken embryos. There are available specific antiviral-antiinfluenza drugs of new generation: oseltamivir and zanamivir that are neuraminidase inhibitors and old generation drugs: amantadine and rimantadine that are inhibitors of M2 protein."

In clinical settings, this malfunction is identified as mild cognitive impairment. Previous studies have suggested that cognitive impairment could be the result of a reduction in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and/or immune dysfunction. Copolymer-1 (Cop-1) is an FDA-approved synthetic peptide capable of inducing the activation of Th2/3 cells, which are able to release BDNF, as well as to migrate and accumulate in the brain. In this study, we evaluated the effect of Cop-1 immunization on improvement of cognition in adult rats. For this purpose, we performed four experiments. We evaluated the effect of Cop-1 immunization on learning/memory using the Morris water maze for spatial memory and autoshaping for associative memory in 3- or 6-month-old rats. BDNF concentrations at the hippocampus were determined by ELISA. Cop-1 immunization induced a significant improvement of spatial memory and associative memory in 6-month-old rats. Likewise, Cop-1 improved spatial memory and associative memory when animals were immunized at 3 months and evaluated at 6 months old. Additionally, Cop-1 induced a significant increase in BDNF levels at the hippocampus. To our knowledge, the present investigation reports the first instance of Cop-1 treatment enhancing cognitive function in normal young adult rats, suggesting that Cop-1 may be a practical therapeutic strategy potentially useful for age- or disease-related cognitive impairment."

The sera were tested for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies, neuraminidase inhibition (NI) antibodies and virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies. Nasal swab samples were tested for influenza-specific IgA antibodies. All volunteers were immunologically naïve to the vaccine strain influenza A/Singapore/1/57 (H2N2). The vaccine was well tolerated. HI titers reached protective levels (geometric mean titer (GMT) >1:40) after two vaccine doses. In the group immunized with the lowest antigen dose the seroprotection rate was 82%. Although the immune response tends to be lower for vaccine formulations with reduced antigen content, the immunogenicity criteria as defined by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) were met with all antigen formulations after two vaccine doses. Significant increases in HI, NI and VN titers were observed, however, no significant local immune response was detected. The use of a low-dose whole virus influenza vaccine, adjuvanted with aluminum appears to be a viable approach to increase vaccine supplies in a pandemic situation."

Mice were immunized intramuscularly with inactivated influenza vaccine with and without the adjuvant MF59 and then challenged with H1N1 influenza. Age was the major factor affecting the inflammatory profile after vaccination: neonatal mice had more interleukin-1α (IL-1α), C-reactive protein (CRP) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), young adults more tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF), and elderly mice more interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), IL-2RA and interferon-γ-induced protein 10 (IP10).

Age also had an impact on the efficacy of vaccination: neonatal and young adult mice were protected against challenge, but aged mice were not. There were striking differences in the localization of the cytokine response depending on the route of exposure: vaccination led to a high serum response whereas intranasal infection led to a low serum response but a high lung response. In conclusion, we demonstrate that age affects the inflammatory response to both influenza vaccination and infection.

The primary outcome was total NMBA dose used to achieve a clinically acceptable depth of neuromuscular block.

Thirty-one perioperative RCTs met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis (n=1962). No studies were conducted in critically ill patients. Reduction in NMBA dose was associated with use of magnesium (SMD: -1.10 [-1.44 to -0.76], P<0.001; I2=85%; GRADE=moderate), dexmedetomidine (SMD: -0.89 [-1.55 to -0.22]; P=0.009; I2=87%; GRADE=low), and clonidine (SMD: -0.67 [-1.13 to -0.22]; P=0.004; I2=0%; GRADE=low) but not lidocaine (SMD: -0.46 [-1.01 to -0.09]; P=0.10; I2=68%; GRADE=moderate). Meta-analyses for nicardipine, diltiazem, and dexamethasone were not possible owing to the low numbers of studies. We estimated that 30-50 mg kg-1 magnesium preoperatively (8-15 mg kg h-1 intraoperatively) reduces rocuronium dose by 25.5% (inter-quartile range, 14.7-31).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Magnesium, dexmedetomidine, and clonidine may confer a clinically relevant sparing effect on the required dose of neuromuscular block ing drugs in the perioperative setting.\n    \n\n\n          Systematic review registration:\n        \n      \n      PROSPERO: CRD42020183969."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Despite the heightened risk of serious influenza during infancy, vaccination is not recommended in infants younger than 6 months. We aimed to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of maternal immunisation with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine for protection of infants against a first episode of laboratory-confirmed influenza.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We did this prospective, active-controlled, observer-blind, randomised phase 4 trial at six referral centres and community health centres in Bamako, Mali. Third-trimester pregnant women (≥28 weeks' gestation) were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated, centre-specific list with alternate block sizes of six or 12, to receive either trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine or quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine. Study personnel administering vaccines were not masked to treatment allocation, but allocation was concealed from clinicians, laboratory personnel, and participants. Infants were visited weekly until age 6 months to detect influenza-like illness; laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosed with RT-PCR. We assessed two coprimary objectives: vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza in infants born to women immunised any time prepartum (intention-to-treat population), and vaccine efficacy in infants born to women immunised at least 14 days prepartum (per-protocol population). The primary outcome was the occurrence of a first case of laboratory-confirmed influenza by age 6 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01430689.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      We did this trial from Sept 12, 2011, to Jan 28, 2014. Between Sept 12, 2011, and April 18, 2013, we randomly assigned 4193 women to receive trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (n=2108) or quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (n=2085). There were 4105 livebirths; 1797 (87%) of 2064 infants in the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine group and 1793 (88%) of 2041 infants in the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine group were followed up until age 6 months. We recorded 5279 influenza-like illness episodes in 2789 (68%) infants, of which 131 (2%) episodes were laboratory-confirmed influenza. 129 (98%) cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza were first episodes (n=77 in the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine group vs n=52 in the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine group). In the intention-to-treat population, overall infant vaccine efficacy was 33·1% (95% CI 3·7-53·9); in the per-protocol population, vaccine efficacy was 37·3% (7·6-57·8). Vaccine efficacy remained robust during the first 4 months of follow-up (67·9% [95% CI 35·1-85·3] by intention to treat and 70·2% [35·7-87·6] by per protocol), before diminishing during the fifth month (57·3% [30·6-74·4] and 60·7 [33·8-77·5], respectively). Adverse event rates in women and infants were similar among groups. Pain at the injection site was more common in women given quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine than in those given trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (n=253 vs n=132; p<0·0001), although 354 [92%] reactions were mild. Obstetrical and non-obstetrical serious adverse events were reported in 60 (3%) women in the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine group and 61 (3%) women in the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine group. Presumed neonatal infection was more common in infants in the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine group than in those in the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine group (n=60 vs n=37; p=0·02). No serious adverse events were related to vaccination.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Vaccination of pregnant women with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in Mali-a poorly resourced country with high infant mortality-was technically and logistically feasible and protected infants from laboratory-confirmed influenza for 4 months. With adequate financing to procure the vaccine, implementation will parallel the access to antenatal care and immunisation coverage of pregnant women with tetanus toxoid.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation."

The trial quality was generally poor and a high level of statistical heterogeneity was evident. The subgroup analysis of bacterial IS studies produced similar results, with lower heterogeneity.

However, due to significant heterogeneity and the poor quality of the trials this positive result should be interpreted with caution. The safety profile of IS appears to be good. Further high-quality trials are needed and we encourage national health authorities to conduct large, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials on the role of IS in the prevention of ARTIs."

            "abstract": "Since the first case of human avian influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in 2013, five H7N9 epidemics have occurred in China, all of which caused severe diseases, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the fatality rates of these epidemics were as high as 30-40%. To control the prevalence of H7N9 influenza, an effective vaccine is urgently needed. In the present study, we used chitosan and recombinant human interleukin-2 as an adjuvant (JY) to promote the systemic and mucosal immune responses induced by the H7N9 vaccine. Mice were immunized intranasally with the inactivated split influenza A (H7N9) virus (A/Shanghai/02/2013) vaccine with or without JY. The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers of mice immunized with the JY-adjuvanted vaccine were significantly higher than those of mice immunized with the vaccine without adjuvant (21.11 ± 9.58 vs. 5.04 ± 3, P < 0.05). The JY-adjuvanted H7N9 nasal spray vaccine induced higher HI titers (8 ± 0.82 vs. 6.7 ± 0.67, P = 0.0035) than those did the poly (I:C)-adjuvanted H7N9 vaccine or the LTB-adjuvanted H7N9 vaccine (8 ± 0.82 vs. 6.9 ± 0.88, P = 0.0186). The optimal immunization regimen for the nasal spray H7N9 vaccine was determined to be a 21-day interval between the primary immunization and booster, with a dose of 4.5 μg hemagglutinin per mouse. The immunogenicities of the nasal spray H7N9 vaccine and intramuscular vaccine (containing only the inactivated split virus) were compared in mice. Two doses of the nasal spray H7N9 vaccine induced higher titers of HI (6.7 ± 0.67 vs. 5.3 ± 1.16, P = 0.004) and anti-HA IgG in sera (19.26 ± 0.67 vs. 13.97 ± 0.82, P < 0.0001) and of anti-HA sIgA (7.13 ± 2.54 vs. 0, P = 0.0000) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) than one dose of intramuscular H7N9 vaccine 3 weeks after the last immunization. However, when we immunized the mice with two doses of both vaccines separately, the nasal spray H7N9 vaccine induced higher titers of anti-HA IgG (19.26 ± 0.67 vs. 17.56 ± 0.57, P < 0.0001) and anti-HA sIgA (7.13 ± 2.54 vs. 4.02 ± 0.33, P = 0.0026) than did the intramuscular H7N9 vaccine, and there was no difference in HI titer between the two groups (P = 0.3745). This finding indicates that the JY-adjuvanted nasal spray H7N9 vaccine induced not only the systemic immune response but also a local mucosal response, which may improve the efficacy of H7N9 influenza prevention through respiratory tract transmission."

We performed a meta-analysis to assess the effect of recent immunization with SIV on serum H5 hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses after influenza A/H5N1 vaccination using data from a series of randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome was seroconversion measured by HAI assays following receipt of 2 doses of H5N1 vaccine. The geometric mean titer (GMT) of serum HAI antibody after vaccination was the secondary outcome. Analyses were performed using propensity score (PS) matching. The PS for each individual in the meta-analysis cohort was calculated using logistic regression and covariates included age, gender, race, antigen dose, adjuvant, statin use and vaccine manufacturer. 2015 subjects enrolled in 7 clinical trials were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis cohort; among these, 915 (45%) were RV. 901 RV subjects were matched (1:1) with replacement to a subject who was NRV. Subjects who received SIV within the previous season were significantly less likely to seroconvert following H5N1 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio 0.76; 95%CI 0.60-0.96; p = 0.024), and the GMT was 18% higher among NRV subjects (GM ratio of HAI antibody 1.18; 95%CI 1.04-1.33; p = 0.008).

However, in order to induce sufficient antibody production with inactivated vaccine, testing of the safety and efficacy of the use of inactivated antigen plus adjuvant is needed. Here, we assessed various types of adjuvants in eyedrop as an anti-influenza serum and mucosal Ab production-enhancer in BALB/c mice. Among the adjuvants, poly (I:C) showed as much enhancement in antigen-specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA antibody production as cholera toxin (CT) after vaccinations with trivalent hemagglutinin-subunits or split H1N1 vaccine antigen in mice. Vaccination with split H1N1 eyedrop vaccine antigen plus poly(I:C) showed a similar or slightly lower efficacy in inducing antibody production than intranasal vaccination; the eyedrop vaccine-induced immunity was enough to protect mice from lethal homologous influenza A/California/04/09 (H1N1) virus challenge. Additionally, ocular inoculation with poly(I:C) plus vaccine antigen generated no signs of inflammation within 24 hours: no increases in the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines nor in the infiltration of mononuclear cells to administration sites. In contrast, CT administration induced increased expression of IL-6 cytokine mRNA and mononuclear cell infiltration in the conjunctiva within 24 hours of vaccination. Moreover, inoculated visualizing materials by eyedrop did not contaminate the surface of the olfactory bulb in mice; meanwhile, intranasally administered materials defiled the surface of the brain. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the use of eyedrop inactivated influenza vaccine plus poly(I:C) is a safe and effective mucosal vaccine strategy for inducing protective anti-influenza immunity."

            "abstract": "High fatality rates and multiple cases of transmission of avian H5N1 influenza viruses to humans illustrate the urgent need for an efficacious, cross-protective vaccine against H5N1 strains. Extensive genetic characterization of H5N1 strains has elucidated the natural evolutionary relationship of these strains, linking groups known as clades to a common ancestor. Although the clades and subclades probably differ sufficiently in their antigenic structure to warrant the preparation of different vaccines, there is some evidence that cross-reactive immunity can be afforded. We aimed to assess the immunogenicity of a clade 1 H5N1 (NIBRG-14) whole-virus vaccine with an aluminum phosphate adjuvant and to determine whether it can induce cross-reactive immunity against antigenically drifted clade 2 H5N1 strains, both those derived by reverse genetics and wild-type isolates. A total of 88 (44 adult and 44 elderly) subjects, who received one dose (6 microg) of the vaccine, were studied. As judged by U.S. and European licensing criteria based on hemagglutination inhibition, the subjects developed cross-reactive immunity against all studied H5N1 strains belonging to a clade different from that of the strain utilized to produce the vaccine. Our findings highlight the importance of stockpiling, since cross-immune reactions induced by prepandemic vaccines will likely reduce morbidity and mortality in case of a pandemic."

The severity of nasal blockage, sneezing and rhinorrhoea was recorded twice daily in a diary and visual analogue assessments (VAS) made at each clinic visit. Nasal provocation testing (NPT) was performed with increasing concentrations of the same extract of D. pteronyssinus as used in the hyposensitization injections, and changes in nasal airways resistance measured by passive anterior rhinomanometry. VAS was recorded and NPT was performed on entry to the study and after the fifth, ninth and final monthly injection. Conjuvac injections were well tolerated. Large local reactions (greater than 5 cm) occurred within 30 min in only 1% of patients but later in 23%. No systemic reactions or anaphylaxis occurred within 30 min of injections, but urticaria or worsening of asthma and rhinitis was reported later in 3% of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

None of the 100 young adults who received two doses of the hepatitis A vaccine 1 year apart mounted a significant (greater than fourfold) antiphospholipid antibody response.

Aluminum salts have long been used but are not considered satisfactory. This has led to the development of other possible compounds, sometimes on the basis of new knowledge concerning the mechanisms regulating the immune response to infections. Some of the new adjuvants (emulsions and virosomes) have been widely evaluated, and the apparently good results have led to the registration of adjuvanted influenza vaccines for use in humans, at least in some countries and in some subjects. In other cases, the adjuvants have been mainly or exclusively studied in experimental animals, and are unlikely to be used in humans in the near future. However, even in the case of those for which a considerable amount of data are available, assessments of their superiority over conventional influenza vaccines have mainly been based on immunogenicity studies, and have not been confirmed by comparative, randomized, double-blind clinical trials. Moreover, the very few human data comparing different adjuvants are frequently conflicting. The aim of this review is to discuss the characteristics and advantages of the adjuvants that have so far been used and to describe some of the new adjuvants that are still in the development phase."

One of the most promising nutritional supplements is β-glucan, a well-known immunomodulator with positive effects on the function of immunocompetent cells. In this double blind, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the effect of pleuran, an insoluble β-(1,3/1,6) glucan from mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus, on selected cellular immune responses and incidence of URTI symptoms in athletes. Fifty athletes were randomized to pleuran or placebo group, taking pleuran (commercial name Imunoglukan(®)) or placebo supplements during 3 months. Venous whole blood was collected before and after 3 months of supplementation and additionally 3 months after supplementation period was completed. Incidence of URTI symptoms together with characterization of changes in phagocytosis and natural killer (NK) cell count was monitored during the study. We found that pleuran significantly reduced the incidence of URTI symptoms and increased the number of circulating NK cells. In addition, the phagocytosis process remained stable in pleuran group during the study in contrast to placebo group where significant reduction of phagocytosis was observed.

Sixty patients were chosen from the same familiar nucleus of the treated subjects and they were used as controls since they all had undergone traditional vaccination against H1N1 influenza.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Forty two out of 52 patients, treated with alkylglycerols did not report any influenza-like symptoms, while 10 out of 52 showed mild influenza-like symptoms which disappeared after 48-72 hours without the use of any drug. In the control group, 20 out of 60 patients did not show any influenza-like symptoms, while 40 out of 60 patients did.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Alkylglycerols may bring therapeutical benefits, support the immunitary system and prevent influenza-like symptoms. Further clinical studies are needed, not only to understand if alkylglycerols can be a valid alternative to vaccination to prevent influenza, but also to study their possible application to treat other pathological conditions."

Two 7.5 μg vaccinations induced seroprotection rates in adult and elderly subjects of 90.9% and 89.1%, respectively. The robust immune response to vaccination was confirmed by analyses of neutralizing antibody titers. Both HI and MN antibodies persisted for ≥ 6 months post-vaccination. Between 34% and 49% of subjects had seroprotective levels of H1N1 A/California/07/2009 antibodies at baseline. Higher baseline HI titers were associated with receipt of the 2008-09 or 2009-10 seasonal influenza vaccine.

Recent studies evaluating the host response to influenza vaccines have revealed key differences in live versus inactivated influenza vaccines, identified early transcriptional signatures that predict hemagglutinin antibody production following vaccination, increased our understanding of how adjuvants enhance the immune response to influenza vaccine antigens, and demonstrate biologic variability in the response to vaccination due to host factors. These studies demonstrate the potential for influenza transcriptomics to be applied to clinical care, understanding the mechanisms of infection, and informing vaccine development."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      IgA deficiency (IgAD) is the most common primary antibody deficiency. Although two-third of the cases are reported to be asymptomatic, some IgAD children may have frequent infections that urge the clinicians to search for prophylactic measures. OM-85 BV is one of these agents that is known to stimulate mucosa associated lymphoid tissue, and upregulate Th-1 response. This study was performed to determine a possible role of OM-85 BV in triggering autoimmunity in IgAD children within a four-year-follow up period.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Sixty-three children (34 males (54%), 29 females (46%)) with sporadic IgAD and recurrent febrile infections were included. Patients were carefully screened for autoimmunity both on admission and in follow-up: Those with autoimmune features or under immunosuppressant treatment were excluded. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: Group I received bacterial lysate propylaxis (OM-85 BV) (n:37), and Group 2 received no prophylactic regimen (n:26). Development of clinical autoimmune findings or autoantibodies (anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), ANA profile (14 antigens), anti-cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-cardiolipin antibodies IgG and IgM (aCL), rheumatoid factor (RF), direct Coombs test, anti-thyroglobulin (anti-T) and anti-thyroid microsomal antigen (anti-M)) were evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Mean age of the study group, age at the onset of infectious symptoms and at admission were 102.9±42.2, 27.1±24.9, and 55.2±25.1 months, respectively. Follow-up duration of the whole study group was 48.3±23.1 months. Number of infections was 6.2±2.7 per year in the whole study group. Sixteen patients (25.4%) of the whole study group showed ANA positivity in different patterns and titers. Frequency of ANA, ANCA and RF positivity was 24.3%, 5.4%, 2.7% in Group 1, and 26.9%, 11.5%, 3.8% in Group 2, respectively. Statistical comparisons revealed no significant difference between the two groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Significant clinical or laboratory markers for autoimmunity in follow-up were not observed between receivers or non-receivers of OM-85 BV. Frequency of ANA positivity was comparable to the previously reported values in IgAD children which was not affected by OM-85 BV usage. Possible effect of triggering autoimmunity with repeated cures of bacterial lysates needs to be further clarified. Side effects requiring the cessation of treatment were not recorded."

At three and six weeks, the extent of the adhesions and the healing of the tendon were evaluated macroscopically and histologically. The range of movement of the toe and tensile strength of the repaired tendons were measured at 20 weeks. The least adhesions were observed in group 4 but no significant difference was found in the healing of the tendons. Overall, the intra-operative application of a combination of hyaluronic acid and amniotic membrane appears to be effective in preventing adhesions of the flexor tendon."

The following review of the genital HSV-2 glycoprotein D (gD2t, t is for truncated) subunit vaccine formulated with a new adjuvant (AS04) containing alum and 3-O deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) provides a background in which to evaluate the vaccine as well as a brief review of other approaches to herpes vaccines. The gD2t-AS04 vaccine has been demonstrated to be safe in several large clinical trials. In two trials, the vaccine reduced genital herpes disease by 73 and 74%, but only in females with no previous HSV infection.

            "abstract": "We have recently developed an enzyme-directed immunostimulant (EDI) prodrug motif, which is metabolized to active immunostimulant by cancer cells and, following drug efflux, activates nearby immune cells, resulting in immunogenicity. In this study, we synthesized several EDI prodrugs featuring an imidazoquinoline immunostimulant resiquimod (a Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist) covalently modified with glycosidase enzyme-directing groups selected from substrates of β-glucuronidase, α-mannosidase, or β-galactosidase. We compared the glycosidase-dependent immunogenicity elicited by each EDI in RAW-Blue macrophages following conversion to active immunostimulant by complementary glycosidase. At a cellular level, we examined EDI metabolism across three cancer cell lines (B16 melanoma, TC2 prostate, and 4T1 breast cancer). Comparing the relative immunogenicity elicited by each EDI/cancer cell combination, we found that B16 cells produced the highest EDI prodrug immunogenicity, achieving >95% of that elicited by unmodified resiquimod, followed by TC2 and 4T1 cells (40% and 30%, respectively). Immunogenicity elicited was comparable for a given cell type and independent of the glycosidase substrate in the EDIs or differences in functional glycosidase activity between cell lines. Measuring drug efflux of the immunostimulant payload and efflux protein expression revealed that EDI/cancer cell-mediated immunogenicity was governed by efflux potential of the cancer cells. We determined that, following EDI conversion, immunostimulant efflux occurred through both P-glycoprotein-dependent and P-glycoprotein-independent transport mechanisms. Overall, this study highlights the broad ability of EDIs to couple immunogenicity to the metabolism of many cancers that exhibit drug efflux and suggests that designing future generations of EDIs with immunostimulant payloads that are optimized for drug efflux could be particularly beneficial."

            "abstract": "Influenza viruses continue to be a major public health concern, despite the availability of vaccines. Currently licensed influenza vaccines aim at the induction of antibodies that target hemagglutinin, the major antigenic determinant on the surface of influenza virions that is responsible for attachment of the virus to the host cell that is to be infected. Currently licensed influenza vaccines come as inactivated or live attenuated influenza vaccines and are trivalent or quadrivalent as they contain antigens of two influenza A and one or two influenza B strains that circulate in the human population, respectively. In this review we briefly compare trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV and QIV) with live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV). The use of the latter vaccine type in children age 2-8 has been disrecommended recently by the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention due to inferior vaccine effectiveness in this age group in recent seasons. This recommendation will favor the use of TIV and QIV over LAIV in the near future. However, there is much evidence from studies in humans that illustrate the benefit of LAIV and we discuss some of the mechanisms that contribute to broader protection against influenza viruses of different subtypes induced by natural infection and LAIV. The future challenge will be to apply these insights to allow induction of broader and long-lasting protection provided by TIV and QIV vaccines, for example, by the use of adjuvants or combining LAIV with TIV and QIV. Other immune factors than serum hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies have shown to correlate with protection provided by TIV and QIV, which illustrates the need for other correlates of protection than hemagglutination inhibition by serum antibodies and justifies more focus on influenza antigens in the TIV and QIV other than hemagglutinin."

The MF59-adjuvanted glycoprotein B (gB) protein subunit vaccine (gB/MF59) is the most efficacious vaccine tested to date for this indication. We previously identified that gB/MF59 vaccination elicited poor neutralizing antibody responses and an immunodominant response against gB antigenic domain 3 (AD-3). Thus, we sought to test novel gB vaccines to improve functional antibody responses and reduce AD-3 immunodominance. Groups of juvenile New Zealand White rabbits were administered 3 sequential doses of the full-length gB protein with an MF59-like squalene-based adjuvant, the gB ectodomain protein (lacking AD-3) with squalene adjuvant, or lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding full-length gB. All vaccines were highly immunogenic with similar kinetics and comparable peak gB-binding and functional antibody responses. The AD-3-immunodominant IgG response following human gB/MF59 vaccination was closely mimicked in rabbits. Though gB ectodomain subunit vaccination eliminated targeting of epitopes in AD-3, it did not improve vaccine-elicited neutralizing or nonneutralizing antibody functions. gB nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP-immunized rabbits exhibited an enhanced durability of vaccine-elicited antibody responses. Furthermore, the gB mRNA-LNP vaccine enhanced the breadth of IgG binding responses against discrete gB peptides. Finally, low-magnitude gB-specific T cell activity was observed in the full-length gB protein and mRNA-LNP groups, though not in ectodomain-vaccinated rabbits. Altogether, these data suggest that the use of gB nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccines is a viable strategy for improving on the partial efficacy of gB/MF59 vaccination and should be further evaluated in preclinical models.IMPORTANCE Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common infectious cause of infant birth defects, resulting in permanent neurological disability for one newborn child every hour in the United States. After more than a half century of research and development, we remain without a clinically licensed vaccine or immunotherapeutic to reduce the burden of HCMV-associated disease. In this study, we sought to improve upon the glycoprotein B protein vaccine (gB/MF59), the most efficacious HCMV vaccine evaluated in a clinical trial, via targeted modifications to either the protein structure or vaccine formulation. Utilization of a novel vaccine platform, nucleoside-modified mRNA formulated in lipid nanoparticles, increased the durability and breadth of vaccine-elicited antibody responses. We propose that an mRNA-based gB vaccine may ultimately prove more efficacious than the gB/MF59 vaccine and should be further evaluated for its ability to elicit antiviral immune factors that can prevent HCMV-associated disease."

Use of these vaccines will protect individuals and reduce the impact on health services to more manageable levels. The majority of the severely ill will be from known risk groups and the best strategy will be to start vaccinating in line with the recommendation from the European Union Health Security Committee prioritizing adults and children with chronic conditions, pregnant women and healthcare workers. The composition of authorized vaccines is reviewed in this article. The vaccine strain in all authorized pandemic vaccines worldwide is based on the same initial isolate of influenza A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v but the vaccines differ in conditions for virus propagation, antigen preparation, antigen content and whether they are adjuvanted or not. The vaccines are likely to be effective since no significant genetic or antigenic drift has occurred and there are already mechanisms for estimating clinical effectiveness. Influenza vaccines have good safety records and no safety concerns have so far been encountered with any of the vaccines developed. However, special mechanisms have been devised for the early detection and rigorous investigation of possible significant side effects in Europe through post-marketing surveillance and analysis. Delivery of the vaccines to the risk groups will pose difficulties where those with chronic illnesses are not readily identifiable to the healthcare services. There is considerable scope for European added value through Member States with excess vaccines making them available to other states."

The exact mechanism of action is unclear, although increasing the viscoelasticity of the synovial fluid appears to play a role. Clinical experience and studies of the two hyaluronic acid products available, hyaluronan and hylan G-F 20, are inconclusive but seem to indicate beneficial effects with minimal adverse reactions in a significant number of patients. The exact indications for viscosupplementation are still evolving, but it currently can be considered for use in patients who have significant residual symptoms despite traditional nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments. In addition, patients who are intolerant of traditional treatments (e.g., gastrointestinal problems related to anti-inflammatory medications) can be considered for these injections.

Based on data retrieved from the regional administrative databases, the statistical analysis was performed using the Cox proportional-hazards model, adjusting for the propensity score to account for the potential confounding effect due to the socio-demographic characteristics and the clinical and reproductive history of women. A total of 100,332 pregnant women were eligible for the analysis. Of these, 2003 (2.0%) received the A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccination during the second or third trimester of gestation. We did not observe any statistically significant association between the A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccination and different maternal outcomes (hospital admissions for influenza, pneumonia, hypertension, eclampsia, diabetes, thyroid disease, and anaemia), fetal outcomes (fetal death after the 22nd gestational week) and neonatal outcomes (pre-term birth, low birth weight, low 5-min Apgar score, and congenital malformations). Pre-existing health-risk conditions (hospital admissions and drug prescriptions for specific diseases before the onset of pregnancy) were observed more frequently among vaccinated women, thus suggesting that concomitant chronic conditions increased vaccination uptake. The results of this study add some evidence on the safety of A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccination during pregnancy but, because of the reduced statistical power, meta-analyses and large multi-centres studies are needed in order to obtain more conclusive results, especially for rare outcomes."

            "abstract": "Conjugation of small molecule agonists of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) to proteins, lipids, or polymers is known to modulate potency, and the physical form or formulation of these conjugates is likely to have a major effect on their immunostimulatory activity. Here, we studied the effect of formulation on potency of a 1,2‑di‑(9Z‑octadecenoyl)‑sn‑glycero‑3‑phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) conjugated TLR7 agonist (DOPE-TLR7a) alongside assessing physical form using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Nanosight Particle Tracking (NTA) analysis and Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). A very high potency of DOPE-TLR7a conjugate (EC50 around 9 nM) was observed either when prepared by direct dilution from DMSO or when formulated into 400-700 nm large multilamella liposomes containing dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide salt (DDA) and DOPE. When prepared by dissolution in DMSO followed by dilution in aqueous culture medium, 93 ± 5 nm nanoparticles were formed. Without dilution from solution in DMSO, no nanoparticles were observed and no immunostimulatory activity could be detected without this formulation step. SAXS analysis of the conjugate after DMSO dissolution/water dilution revealed a lamellar order with a layer spacing of 68.7 Å, which correlates with arrangement in groups of 3 bilayers. The addition of another immunostimulatory glycolipid, trehalose‑6,6‑dibehenate (TDB), to DOPE:DDA liposomes gave no further increase in immunostimulatory activity beyond that provided by incorporating DOPE-TLR7a. Given the importance of nanoparticle or liposomal formulation for activity, we conclude that the major mechanism for increased potency when TLR7 agonists are conjugated to macromolecules is through alteration of physical form."

Other topics to be addressed included a comparison of egg- and cell culture-based influenza vaccines, technical issues related to vaccine strain development and vaccine potency, and the status of development of prototype influenza vaccines using new technologies. Pandemic A (H1N1) vaccines were safe in young children, pregnant women and immunocompromized individuals. Overall effectiveness of inactivated A (H1N1) vaccines for all ages was found to vary between 72% and 100% in different countries and with different vaccine preparations. Effectiveness of pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 live attenuated vaccine was estimated to be approximately 80% in pediatric populations in the USA. A single dose of inactivated vaccine adjuvanted with AS03, MF59 or AF03 induced protective immunity in young children and pregnant women. However, unadjuvanted vaccines as well as low dose adjuvanted vaccines (1.9 μg HA) required two doses to elicit protective antibody levels in these populations. Clinical trials of influenza vaccines developed using new technologies showed they were well tolerated and induced antibody and/or T cell immune responses to viral proteins. Further studies are warranted to validate novel immunological criteria for evaluation and licensing of such new influenza vaccine concepts. On the regulatory side, work should be undertaken to harmonize the results of serological tests used to evaluate the immunogenicity of traditional influenza vaccines."

A paucity of information exists regarding the effects of different therapies to prevent and treat bone loss in the renal transplant recipients. We constructed a design to study the effect of different modalities of treatment on bone mass in our renal transplant children. Among 93 patients who underwent renal transplantation at the age of 17 yr or less and were subjected to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), we blindly randomized 60 patients who had osteopenia or osteoporosis (T-score = -1 by DEXA) in a prospective study. Their mean age at time of transplantation was 13.4 +/- 4.3 yr. The mean duration after transplantation was 48 +/- 34 months. The patients were classified randomly into four groups. Each group consisted of 15 patients: group 1 was the control group, group 2 received oral alfacalcidol 0.25 microg daily, group 3 received oral alendronate 5 mg daily, and group 4 received 200 IU/day nasal spray calcitonin. Parameters of bone turnover, calcium metabolism, and DEXA were measured before and after 12 months of treatment duration. The characteristics of all groups were comparable at the beginning of the study. At the lumber spine, bone mass density decreased from -2.4 to -2.8 in group 1, increased from -2.3 to -0.5 in group 2, from -2.3 to -1.9 in group 3, and from -2.3 to -1.0 in group 4. The four groups had similar patient profiles, serum creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, and deoxypyridinoline. This study confirmed the value of alfacalcidol and antiresorptive agents in the treatment of osteopenia and osteoporosis in young renal transplant recipients.These therapies were safe, tolerable, simple to administer and potentially applicable to other renal transplant patients."

            "abstract": "Older adults (> or =65 years of age) are particularly vulnerable to influenza illness. This is due to a waning immune system that reduces their ability to respond to infection, which leads to more severe cases of disease. The majority ( approximately 90%) of influenza-related deaths occur in older adults and, in addition, catastrophic disability resulting from influenza-related hospitalization represents a significant burden in this vulnerable population. Current influenza vaccines provide benefits for older adults against influenza; however, vaccine effectiveness is lower than in younger adults. In addition, antigenic drift is also a concern, as it can impact on vaccine effectiveness due to a mismatch between the vaccine virus strain and the circulating virus strain. As such, vaccines that offer higher and broader protection against both homologous and heterologous virus strains are desirable. Approaches currently available in some countries to meet this medical need in older adults may include the use of adjuvanted vaccines. Future strategies under evaluation include the use of high-dose vaccines; novel or enhanced adjuvantation of current vaccines; use of live attenuated vaccines in combination with current vaccines; DNA vaccines; recombinant vaccines; as well as the use of different modes of delivery and alternative antigens. However, to truly evaluate the benefits that these solutions offer, further efficacy and effectiveness studies, and better correlates of protection, including a precise measurement of the T cell responses that are markers for protection, are needed. While it is clear that vaccines with greater immunogenicity are required for older adults, and that adjuvanted vaccines may offer a short-term solution, further research is required to exploit the many other new technologies."

Economic losses have occurred from early infection and co-infection with other pathogens. Therefore, H9N2 vaccination of broiler chicks as young as 7 days old was recommended. The current inactivated H9N2 vaccines (0.5 ml/bird) administered at a reduced dose (0.25 ml/bird) do not guarantee the delivery of an effective dose for broilers. In this study, the efficacy of the reduced-dose volume (0.3 ml/bird), compared with the regular vaccine dose (0.5 ml/bird) of inactivated H9N2 vaccines using two different commercially available adjuvants, was investigated. The vaccines were prepared from the local H9N2 virus (Ck/EG/114940v/NLQP/11) using the same antigen content: 300 hemagglutinating units. Postvaccination (PV) immune response was monitored using the hemagglutination inhibition test. At 4 wk PV, both vaccinated groups were challenged using the homologous H9N2 strain at a 50% egg infective dose (EID50) of 10(6) EID50/bird via the intranasal route. Clinical signs, mortality, and virus shedding in oropharyngeal swabs were monitored at 2, 4, 6, and 10 days postchallenge (DPC). The reduced-dose volume of vaccine induced a significantly faster and higher immune response than the regular volume of vaccine at 2 and 3 wk PV. No significant difference in virus shedding between the two vaccine formulas was found (P ≥ 0.05), and both vaccines were able to stop virus shedding by 6 DPC. The reduced-dose volume of vaccine using a suitable oil adjuvant and proper antigen content can be used effectively for early immunization of broiler chicks."

It is recognized that pandemic vaccines have their greatest impact as a preventive strategy when administered before or near the peak incidence of cases in an outbreak. Therefore, vaccination campaigns should be in place when influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccines are available.

However, IPV is significantly more expensive than OPV. One strategy to make IPV more affordable is to reduce the dose by adding adjuvants, compounds that augment the immune response to the vaccine. No adjuvants are currently utilized in stand-alone IPV; however, several have been explored over the past six decades. From aluminum, used in many licensed vaccines, to newer and more experimental adjuvants such as synthetic DNA, a diverse group of compounds has been assessed with varying strengths and weaknesses.

Associated with some cases of GWI are increased incidences of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurological disorders. Whereas many environmental factors have been linked to GWI, the role of the anthrax vaccine has come under increasing scrutiny. Among the vaccine's potentially toxic components are the adjuvants aluminum hydroxide and squalene. To examine whether these compounds might contribute to neuronal deficits associated with GWI, an animal model for examining the potential neurological impact of aluminum hydroxide, squalene, or aluminum hydroxide combined with squalene was developed. Young, male colony CD-1 mice were injected with the adjuvants at doses equivalent to those given to US military service personnel. All mice were subjected to a battery of motor and cognitive-behavioral tests over a 6-mo period postinjections. Following sacrifice, central nervous system tissues were examined using immunohistochemistry for evidence of inflammation and cell death. Behavioral testing showed motor deficits in the aluminum treatment group that expressed as a progressive decrease in strength measured by the wire-mesh hang test (final deficit at 24 wk; about 50%). Significant cognitive deficits in water-maze learning were observed in the combined aluminum and squalene group (4.3 errors per trial) compared with the controls (0.2 errors per trial) after 20 wk. Apoptotic neurons were identified in aluminum-injected animals that showed significantly increased activated caspase-3 labeling in lumbar spinal cord (255%) and primary motor cortex (192%) compared with the controls. Aluminum-treated groups also showed significant motor neuron loss (35%) and increased numbers of astrocytes (350%) in the lumbar spinal cord. The findings suggest a possible role for the aluminum adjuvant in some neurological features associated with GWI and possibly an additional role for the combination of adjuvants."

Recently, prophylactic vaccines have been developed to prevent infections with cancer-associated HPV types (HPV16 and HPV18). The aim of this study was to analyze the changes in the immune system that occur within four weeks of the first dose of HPV-16/18 ASO4-adjuvanted vaccine. Assessment of the percentages of selected cell populations in peripheral blood of 20 healthy volunteers vaccinated with Cervarix was performed using flow cytometry. The analysis revealed an increase in the proportion of activated B and CD4+ T helper cells and an absence of significant differences in cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes, indicating activation of the humoral response after vaccination, without a significant effect on cellular response. There were no significant changes in the NK cell population, and there was a reduction of the percentage of NKT-like cells, which may result from expiry of the primary response at the time of analysis. The presented results are preliminary, and in the context of the increasing use of the anti-HPV vaccine, it would be worth continuing the study in larger groups of patients and at earlier and later time points in combination with the measurement of specific anti-HPV16 and -HPV18 antibody levels. Such an assessment could therefore contribute not only to better understanding of the exact mechanism of action of the vaccine, but also to defining the immunological parameters that determine its effectiveness."

The 186 adults were assigned to three treatment groups, i.e., one 15 μg hemagglutination (HA) antigen dose, two 15 μg or 30 μg HA doses in 3 weeks apart, and the 107 elders were treated with two 15 μg or 30 μg doses in 3 weeks apart. Prior to the vaccination, 4.8% subjects had hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody titers of 1:40 or more. By day 21 post-vaccination of one dose of 15 μg HA, the seroprotective rate was 95.1% and 75.5% in subjects <60 and >65 years of age, respectively; by day 21 post the second 15 μg HA dose, the seroprotective rates were 93.2% and 73.1%, respectively. The seroprotective rates for recipients of 30 μg HA antigen by day 21 were 95.2% for subjects <60 years and 81.1% for subjects >65 years of age, that was boosted to 98.3% and 80.4%, respectively with a second dose of 30 μg HA antigen. No vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred. The data indicated a single 15 μg HA dose of the vaccine induced a protective immune response in most adults, including the elders >60 years of age, and a booster dose at the third week did not render a higher level of antibody response."

            "title": "Clinical trials to assess adjuvant therapeutics for severe malaria.",
            "abstract": "Despite potent anti-malarial treatment, mortality rates associated with severe falciparum malaria remain high. To attempt to improve outcome, several trials have assessed a variety of potential adjunctive therapeutics, however none to date has been shown to be beneficial. This may be due, at least partly, to the therapeutics chosen and clinical trial design used. Here, we highlight three themes that could facilitate the choice and evaluation of putative adjuvant interventions for severe malaria, paving the way for their assessment in randomized controlled trials. Most clinical trials of adjunctive therapeutics to date have been underpowered due to the large number of participants required to reach mortality endpoints, rendering these study designs challenging and expensive to conduct. These limitations may be mitigated by the use of risk-stratification of participants and application of surrogate endpoints. Appropriate surrogate endpoints include direct measures of pathways causally involved in the pathobiology of severe and fatal malaria, including markers of host immune and endothelial activation and microcirculatory dysfunction. We propose using circulating markers of these pathways to identify high-risk participants that would be most likely to benefit from adjunctive therapy, and further by adopting these biomarkers as surrogate endpoints; moreover, choosing interventions that target deleterious host immune responses that directly contribute to microcirculatory dysfunction, multi-organ dysfunction and death; and, finally, prioritizing where possible, drugs that act on these pathways that are already approved by the FDA, or other regulators, for other indications, and are known to be safe in target populations, including children. An emerging understanding of the critical role of the host response in severe malaria pathogenesis may facilitate both clinical trial design and the search of effective adjunctive therapeutics."

Both the antigen and adjuvant were filled in separate multi-dose vials within 4 months of use, and on the day of vaccination, the contents of antigen and adjuvant vials were mixed. Seventy-eight adults aged 18-64 years were scheduled to receive two doses of hemagglutinin-antigen (3.75μg) given 21 days apart. Antibody responses were assessed by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay according to age (18-30 years, 31-40 years, 41-50 years, and 51-64 years).

AutoAb occurrence and autoimmune thyroid diseases are also frequently detected in MS patients free of any treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between IFN-beta 1b treatment, autoAb occurrence, and autoimmune diseases in MS. Thyroid and liver function and serum autoAb (antithyroid, antinuclear, anti-liver, anti-kidney microsomes, anti-smooth muscle and parietal cell antigens) occurrence were evaluated in 156 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients before and every 3 months after starting IFN-beta 1b treatment (8 MIU subcutaneously [s.c.] on alternate days). The probability of having liver or thyroid function alteration or autoAb occurrence was analyzed longitudinally with the generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach. At baseline, 16.1% of patients had autoAb. During treatment, autoAb occurred de novo in 7.2% of patients. GEE analysis showed that the probability of having autoAb at any time during IFN-beta 1b treatment did not change significantly compared with baseline. AutoAb occurring de novo rarely persisted during treatment and significantly less than those already present at baseline. Positivity for autoAb at baseline or during treatment was not correlated with the development of thyroid or liver function alteration during IFN-beta 1b treatment. Our study indicates that IFN-beta treatment is a safe treatment for MS patients, free of risk of autoimmunity and of associated liver or thyroid function alteration."

The selected virtual hits were experimentally tested in TLR2-reporter cells and their activity in phagocytes and DCs was characterized.

Biacore experiments indicated that AG1-AG4 are ago-allosteric modulators of TLR2 and AG2 bound TLR2 with high affinity (KD 0.8μM).

            "abstract": "Acute exercise prior to vaccination can improve the antibody response to influenza vaccination. However, both the optimal exercise protocol and the mechanisms underpinning this adjuvant effect remain unclear. The aim of the current study was to determine whether exercise intensity influenced the efficacy of the intervention. One hundred and sixty healthy young adults were randomly assigned to a resting control group or one of three intervention groups, who exercised at an intensity of 60%, 85%, or 110% of their pre-determined concentric one repetition maxima. The exercise groups performed 50 repetitions of the eccentric portion of both bicep curl and lateral raise movements. All participants then immediately received a reduced dose (50% recommended dose) influenza vaccine. Antibody titres to the three viral strains contained in the vaccine were measured at baseline and at 28 days post-vaccination. Compared to the control group, exercise enhanced the antibody response to the least immunogenic of the three strains (B/Florida). In addition, the exercise groups showed an augmented response to the A/Uruguay strain compared to control; however, this effect was observed only in men. The intervention had no effect on the antibody responses to the most immunogenic strain, A/Brisbane. Finally, antibody responses were unrelated to the intensity of the exercise bout. In conclusion, our findings provide further evidence of exercise as an adjuvant to enhance vaccination responses. The results further show that responses to the low-immunogenic antigens are particularly responsive to augmentation by acute eccentric exercise."

At the 5% confidence level, a statistically significant reduction in sickness absence due to influenza was found in this vaccinated group when compared with a control group of 918 employees. This trend was observed at both establishments. Some confirmation was thus obtained of serological predictions that protection would last two to three years or longer after inoculation.

Despite the nonoptimal coverage, even in subjects at risk like the elderly, pregnant women, etc., these vaccines significantly reduce the burden of mortality and morbidity linked to the influenza infection. Importantly, these vaccines have also contributed to reduce the impact of the last pandemics. Nevertheless, the performance of these vaccines can be improved mainly in those age groups, like children and the elderly, in which their efficacy is suboptimal. The use of adjuvants has proven effective to this scope. Oil-in-water adjuvants like MF59 and AS03 have been licensed and widely used, and shown efficacious in preventing influenza infection in the last pandemic. MF59-adjuvanted inactivated vaccine was more efficacious than non-adjuvanted vaccine in preventing influenza infection in young children and in reducing hospitalization due to the influenza infection in the elderly. Other adjuvants are now at different stages of development and some are being tested in clinical trials. The perspective remains to improve the way inactivated vaccines are prepared and to accelerate their availability, mainly in the case of influenza pandemics, and to enhance their efficacy/effectiveness for a more successful impact at the public health level."

Both studies were randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trials. Study 1 compared liquid, aluminum-adjuvanted V710 (30 μg) with liquid, non-adjuvanted V710 (30 μg) in a 1:1 ratio in 64 healthy adults (18-70 years). Study 2 compared non-adjuvanted lyophilized V710 (60 μg) with saline placebo in a 4:1 ratio in 51 healthy adults (18-80 years). Blood was collected at screening and up to Day 360 postvaccination in Study 1, and at screening and up to Day 84 postvaccination in Study 2. Sera were analyzed for IsdB-specific antibodies using a total IgG assay. The primary endpoints in Study 1 were the proportion of patients with a positive immune response (≥2-fold rise in IsdB-specific IgG antibody level) the geometric mean concentration (GMC), and the geometric mean-fold rise (GMFR), all from baseline at Day 14. The primary endpoint in Study 2 was the GMFR in IsdB-specific IgG antibody concentration from baseline at Day 14. In Study 1, 84.4% responded in the adjuvanted V710 group, and 71.9% in the non-adjuvanted V710 group. The GMC was 115.4 μg/mL in the adjuvanted group and 99.1 μg/mL in the nonadjuvanted group. The GMFR in antibody concentration in the group receiving aluminum-adjuvanted V710 was 4.5 and the GMFR in the group receiving non-adjuvanted V710 was 4.0. In Study 2, the GMFR in antibody concentration in the V710 group was 5.3, and 80.5% had a positive immune response. None responded in the placebo group. Positive immune response was seen in the active treatment groups over the full duration of each study. There were no serious adverse experiences (AE) in either study, and no patients discontinued due to an AE. There were no clinically meaningful differences in AEs between groups in either study. In conclusion, V710, both with and without aluminum adjuvant, and in both liquid and lyophilized formulations, was immunogenic within 14 days of vaccination.

The 2009 pandemic provided us with the opportunity to evaluate the immune response to vaccination in a unique setting. We evaluated both antibody and T cell responses in a cohort of public health care workers (18-52 years) during two consecutive influenza seasons from 2009 to 2011 and compared the MF59-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine with the unadjuvanted seasonal subunit vaccine that included the pandemic strain [The study was registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR2070)]. Antibody responses were determined in serum by a hemagglutination inhibition assay. Vaccine-specific T cell responses were evaluated by detecting IFN-γ producing peripheral blood mononuclear cells using whole influenza virus or vaccine-specific peptide pools as stimulating antigens. Mixed effects regression models were used to correct the data for influenza-specific pre-existing immunity due to previous infections or vaccinations and for age and sex. We show that one dose of the pandemic vaccine induced antibody responses sufficient for providing seroprotection and that the vaccine induced T cell responses. A second dose further increased antibody responses but not T cell responses. Nonetheless, both could be boosted by the seasonal vaccine in the subsequent season. Furthermore, we show that the seasonal vaccine alone is capable of inducing vaccine-specific T cell responses, despite the fact that the vaccine did not contain an adjuvant. In addition, residual antibody levels remained detectable for over 15 months, while T cell levels in the blood had contracted to baseline levels by that time. Hereby, we show that pandemic as well as seasonal vaccines induce both humoral and cellular responses, however, with a different profile of induction and waning, which has its implications for future vaccine design."

Although progress has been made in understanding qualitatively how repeated exposures shape the antibody mediated immune response, quantitative understanding remains limited. We developed a set of mathematical models describing short-term antibody kinetics following influenza infection or vaccination and fit them to haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres from 5 groups of ferrets which were exposed to different combinations of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV with or without adjuvant), A/H3N2 priming inoculation and post-vaccination A/H1N1 inoculation. We fit models with various immunological mechanisms that have been empirically observed but have not previously been included in mathematical models of antibody landscapes, including: titre ceiling effects, antigenic seniority and exposure-type specific cross reactivity. Based on the parameter estimates of the best supported models, we describe a number of key immunological features. We found quantifiable differences in the degree of homologous and cross-reactive antibody boosting elicited by different exposure types. Infection and adjuvanted vaccination generally resulted in strong, broadly reactive responses whereas unadjuvanted vaccination resulted in a weak, narrow response. We found that the order of exposure mattered: priming with A/H3N2 improved subsequent vaccine response, and the second dose of adjuvanted vaccination resulted in substantially greater antibody boosting than the first. Either antigenic seniority or a titre ceiling effect were included in the two best fitting models, suggesting a role for a mechanism describing diminishing antibody boosting with repeated exposures. Although there was considerable uncertainty in our estimates of antibody waning parameters, our results suggest that both short and long term waning were present and would be identifiable with a larger set of experiments. These results highlight the potential use of repeat exposure animal models in revealing short-term, strain-specific immune dynamics of influenza."

            "abstract": "A prospective economic analysis of lenograstim and placebo was performed as part of a randomised double-blind trial in 162 patients receiving chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The primary clinical end-point was the percentage of patients experiencing > or = 1 documented infection in each treatment group. The cost of hospitalisation and the cost of medical services used were the primary economic end-points. Economic analysis was based on the French Hospital perspective. Over the 56-day study period, patients in the placebo group received more days of inpatient intravenous (8.9 vs 5.3 days; p < 0.01) and oral (5.3 vs 4.2 days) antibiotic therapy than those in the lenograstim group. This difference was due to a higher rate of documented infection in the placebo group. Patients treated with placebo also spent more days in hospital for reasons other than administration of chemotherapy (18.5 vs 14.4; p < 0.05). The number of days of chemotherapy was significantly greater in the lenograstim group than in the placebo group (19.4 vs 17.5; p < 0.001) because of shorter delays between chemotherapy cycles in the lenograstim group. The use of lenograstim to prevent chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with NHL was associated with a reduction in total direct medical costs (excluding the cost of lenograstim) of FF7297 as a result of reduced patient morbidity. Furthermore, the higher rate of completion of chemotherapy in the lenograstim group may lead to better long term survival; this observation deserves further clinical investigation."

A series of experiments have demonstrated that E. purpurea extracts do indeed demonstrate significant immunomodulatory activities. Among the many pharmacological properties reported, macrophage activation has been demonstrated most convincingly. Phagocytotic indices and macrophage-derived cytokine concentrations have been shown to be Echinacea-responsive in a variety of assays. Activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and natural killer cells has also been reasonably demonstrated. Changes in the numbers and activities of T- and B-cell leukocytes have been reported, but are less certain. Despite this cellular evidence of immunostimulation, pathways leading to enhanced resistance to infectious disease have not been described adequately. Several dozen human experiments--including a number of blind randomized trials--have reported health benefits. The most robust data come from trials testing E. purpurea extracts in the treatment for acute upper respiratory infection. Although suggestive of modest benefit, these trials are limited both in size and in methodological quality. Hence, while there is a great deal of moderately good-quality scientific data regarding E. purpurea, effectiveness in treating illness or in enhancing human health has not yet been proven beyond a reasonable doubt."

All vaccines exhibited a very good immunogenic effect as judged from the number of volunteers with at least a four-fold rise in antibodies in the HI-test and those reaching titres that are considered to be sufficiently high for protection against disease. The best results were obtained with the aqueous subunit vaccine. All four vaccines also stimulated the formation of neuraminidase-inhibiting antibodies.

            "abstract": "Annually influenza virus infections are responsible for hospitalization and mortality, especially in high risk groups. Constant antigenic changes in seasonal influenza viruses resulted from antigenic shifts and antigenic drifts, enable emerging of novel virus subtypes that may reduce current vaccine efficacy and impose the continuous revision of vaccine component. Currently available vaccines are usually limited by their production processes in terms of rapid adaptation to new circulating subtypes in high quantities meeting the global demand. Thus, new approaches to rapidly manufacture high yields of influenza vaccines are required. New technologies to reach maximal protection with minimal vaccine doses also need to be developed. In this study, we evaluated the systemic and local immunogenicity of a new double-adjuvanted influenza vaccine administered at the site of infection, the respiratory tract. This vaccine combines a plant-produced H1N1 influenza hemagglutinin antigen (HAC1), a silica nanoparticle-based (SiO₂) drug delivery system and the mucosal adjuvant candidate bis-(3',5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). Mice were vaccinated by intratracheal route with HAC1/SiO₂ or HAC1/c-di-GMP (single-adjuvanted vaccine) or HAC1/SiO₂/c-di-GMP (double-adjuvanted vaccine) and evaluated for target-specific immune responses, such as hemagglutination inhibition and hemagglutinin-specific IgG titers, as well as local antibody (IgG and IgA) titers in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Furthermore, the HAC1-specific T-cell re-stimulation potential was assessed using precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) of vaccinated mice. The double-adjuvanted vaccine induced high systemic antibody responses comparable to the systemic vaccination control. In addition, it induced local IgG and IgA responses in the BAL. Furthermore, HAC1 induced a local T-cell response demonstrated by elevated IL-2 and IFN-γ levels in PCLS of c-di-GMP-vaccinated mice upon re-stimulation. Overall, the present study showed the potential of the double-adjuvanted vaccine to induce systemic humoral immune responses in intratracheally vaccinated mice. Furthermore, it induced a strong mucosal immune response, with evidence of antigen-primed T-cells in the lung."

            "abstract": "The barrier function of the skin is related to the unique composition of the stratum corneum (SC) lipids and their complex structural arrangement. The high content of ceramides would seem to be ideally suited for the formation of ordered impermeable membrane. Skin penetration enhancers (PE) are molecules which reversibly remove the barrier resistance of the SC. Interactions with SC intercellular lipids are of crucial importance for the effectiveness of PE action. Their mode of action on the lipid bilayer may involve interactions at two sites, i.e., at or near the polar head groups of the lipid bilayer and/or between the hydrophobic tails of the bilayer. This paper discusses the local effect of four PE, among the most investigated, limonene, ethanol, oleic acid and DMSO. FTIR is used in this study to highlight the local effect of the PE on ceramides films. Lipophilic PE, i.e., oleic acid and limonene, both present a direct fluidizing action on the alkyl chains and an indirect action on the polar head groups resulting in a more spacing lipid packing. Hydrophilic PE, i.e., ethanol and DMSO, have no interaction on the lipid bilayer but show a complex action on the polar headgroup, weakening the H-bonds. Our most significant finding is that each PE we investigated interacted with the ceramide packing, depending of these structures. Such modifications contribute a share to interpretation, at the molecular level, of the decrease of skin barrier properties with PE described in published data."

Subjects received either vaccine containing 15 μg of haemagglutinin (HA) of each of three influenza strains for the 2003-2004 season on days 0 and 14, or 30 μg on day 0 and saline placebo on day 14, or placebo on days 0 and 14. Vaccination was well tolerated, with similar reactogenicity as placebo. Compared to placebo, statistically significant increases in mean serum haemagglutinin inhibition reciprocal titers and salivary secretory IgA to all 3 antigens were seen on day 28 for both vaccine dose groups. The incidence of culture-positive influenza and fever >37.8°C and cough and one or more of sore throat, runny nose or nasal congestion, muscle or joint ache, headache, fatigue, or chills or culture positive influenza and at least two of these symptoms was low (16/1349; 1.2%). In the intent-to-immunize population too few febrile culture-confirmed illness events (n=4) occurred to perform analysis. Fever occurred infrequently, even in the presence of positive cultures and disabling multi-symptom disease. In participants receiving all doses of either vaccine regimen the incidence of culture-confirmed influenza with respiratory symptoms and with or without fever was 0.77% (7/904) vs. 2.03% (9/443) in placebo recipients (p=0.045, Fisher's exact test; relative risk reduction 62%), despite circulation of a drift variant A/H3N2 that was poorly matched to vaccine. An OMP-TIV vaccine was well tolerated and reduced risk of symptomatic culture confirmed influenza. Vaccine efficacy will need to be validated in a season with a higher attack rate."

Controls were matched to cases on age, sex and type of underlying medical condition(s) and drawn from an extensive general practitioner network. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the vaccine effectiveness (VE = 1 - OR).

It was estimated that 22% of the cases and 28% of the controls received vaccination more than 7 days before the date of onset of symptoms in cases. A significant number of breakthrough infections were observed. The VE was estimated at 19% (95%CI -28-49). After restricting the analysis to cases with controls suffering from severe underlying medical conditions, the VE was 49% (95% CI 16-69).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The number of breakthrough infections, resulting in modest VE estimates, suggests that the MF-59™ adjuvanted vaccine may have had only a limited impact on preventing 2009 influenza A/H1N1-related hospitalisation in this setting. As the main aim of influenza vaccination programmes is to reduce severe influenza-related morbidity and mortality from influenza in persons at high risk of complications, a more effective vaccine, or additional preventive measures, are needed."

            "abstract": "Notwithstanding the progress recently made in immunology and virology, there is yet no effective, specific treatment for the common cold. Symptomatic treatment is minimally effective. An anecdotal report of rapid clearing of the common cold of recent onset after intranasal application of imiquimod in several subjects by one of the authors, made us test the hypothesis that this treatment works through the secretion of interferon by the nasal mucosa. We decided to do an animal study in primates (Indian Macaca Mulata): 5 treatment and 3 control animals were used. Imiquimod or placebo was massaged into the nares of the animals and periodic samples of post-nasal fluid were taken and measurements for Interferon alpha (IFNalpha) and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFalpha) were made by ELISA methods, and kinetic studies. mRNA IFNalpha was also isolated and analyzed by quantitative competitive RT-PCR. The internal standard was constructed to be complementary to and compete with oligonucleotide primers and for amplification of target sequences. One intranasal application of imiquimod rapidly (1-4 Hours) induced high levels of mRNA for IFNalpha, and minimal levels in the control animals. Rapid induction of INFalpha, and proportional increase of TNFalpha sustained for 4 and 6 hours respectively were noted. No adverse reactions to treatment were found in macaques during this short period of intranasal imiquimod usage (except in one macaque with a short period of lacrimation). No animal had cytotoxic effects when examined at 6 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr or 48 hr, except one animal, which had an episode of lacrimation for 6 hr post treatment. Thus both safety and efficacy of short treatment with imiquimod is proven in this animal model. Proof of principle for intranasal treatment of the common cold with imiquimod is shown. We think that this work will encourage a number of double blind clinical trials to confirm the effectiveness of the intranasal treatment of the common cold with imiquimod."

Therapeutic administration of noni-ppt significantly enhanced the duration of survival of inbred syngeneic LLC tumour bearing mice. It did not exert significant cytotoxic effects in an adapted culture of LLC cells, LLC1, but could activate peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) to impart profound toxicity when co-cultured with the tumour cells. This suggested the possibility that noni-ppt may suppress tumour growth through activation of the host immune system. Concomitant treatment with the immunosuppressive agent, 2-chloroadenosine (C1-Ade) or cyclosporin (cys-A) diminished its activity, thereby substantiating an immunomodulatory mechanism. Noni-ppt was also capable of stimulating the release of several mediators from murine effector cells, including tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-10, IL-12 p70, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and nitric oxide (NO), but had no effect on IL-2 and suppressed IL-4 release. Improved survival time and curative effects occurred when noni-ppt was combined with sub-optimal doses of the standard chemotherapeutic agents, adriamycin (Adria), cisplatin (CDDP), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and vincristine (VCR), suggesting important clinical applications of noni-ppt as a supplemental agent in cancer treatment."

Using a novel manufacturing platform based on transient expression of influenza surface glycoproteins in Nicotiana benthamiana, we have recently demonstrated that a candidate Virus-Like Particle (VLP) vaccine can be generated within 3 weeks of release of sequence information. Herein we report that alum-adjuvanted plant-made VLPs containing the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of H5N1 influenza (A/Indonesia/5/05) can induce cross-reactive antibodies in ferrets. Even low doses of this vaccine prevented pathology and reduced viral loads following heterotypic lethal challenge. We further report on safety and immunogenicity from a Phase I clinical study of the plant-made H5 VLP vaccine in healthy adults 18-60 years of age who received 2 doses 21 days apart of 5, 10 or 20 µg of alum-adjuvanted H5 VLP vaccine or placebo (alum). The vaccine was well tolerated at all doses. Adverse events (AE) were mild-to-moderate and self-limited. Pain at the injection site was the most frequent AE, reported in 70% of vaccinated subjects versus 50% of the placebo recipients. No allergic reactions were reported and the plant-made vaccine did not significantly increase the level of naturally occurring serum antibodies to plant-specific sugar moieties. The immunogenicity of the H5 VLP vaccine was evaluated by Hemagglutination-Inhibition (HI), Single Radial Hemolysis (SRH) and MicroNeutralisation (MN). Results from these three assays were highly correlated and showed similar trends across doses. There was a clear dose-response in all measures of immunogenicity and almost 96% of those in the higher dose groups (2 × 10 or 20 µg) mounted detectable MN responses. Evidence of striking cross-protection in ferrets combined with a good safety profile and promising immunogenicity in humans suggest that plant-based VLP vaccines should be further evaluated for use in pre-pandemic or pandemic situations.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00984945."

The method of BCG administration varies in each facility and even with each doctor.

These polymers can influence innate and cell-mediated immunity through interactions with T cells, monocytes, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes. The ability to modulate the immune response in an appropriate way can enhance the host's immune response to certain infections. In addition, this strategy can be utilized to augment current treatment regimens such as antimicrobial therapy that are becoming less efficacious with the advent of antibiotic resistance.

The A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 seroconversion and seroprotection rates were ≥ 90% and geometric mean titres (GMTs) increased 3.2-14.9 times without any statistically significant between-group differences; however, the seroconversion and seroprotection rates against the B strain were significantly higher in the children receiving either ID-TIV dose (p<0.05) without any differences between them. GMT against B virus was significantly higher in the children receiving the highest dose (p<0.05). Local reactions were significantly more common among the children receiving either ID-TIV dose (p<0.05), but systemic reactions were relatively uncommon in all three groups.

The framework identifies conditions whereby EVPI may be calculated numerically, where the one-level algorithm sufficiently approximates the two-level algorithm, and whereby metamodelling techniques may accurately approximate the original simulation model. Metamodelling techniques, including linear regression, neural networks and Gaussian processes (GP), were systematically reviewed and critically appraised. Linear regression metamodelling, GP metamodelling and the one-level EVPI approximation were used to estimate partial EVPIs using the ScHARR MS cost-effectiveness model.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The review of metamodelling approaches suggested that in general the simpler techniques such as linear regression may be easier to implement, as they require little specialist expertise although may provide only limited predictive accuracy. More complex methods such as Gaussian process metamodelling and neural networks tend to use less-restrictive assumptions concerning the relationship between the model inputs and net benefits, and therefore may permit greater accuracy in estimating EVPIs. Assuming independent treatment efficacy, the 'per patient' EVPI for all uncertainty parameters within the ScHARR MS model is 8855 British pounds. This leads to a population EVPI of 86,208,936 British pounds, which represents the upper estimate for the overall EVPI over 10 years. Assuming all treatment efficacies are perfectly correlated, the overall per patient EVPI is 4271 British pounds. This leads to a population EVPI of 41,581,273 British pounds, which represents the lower estimate for the overall EVPI over 10 years. The partial EVPI analysis, undertaken using both the linear regression metamodel and Gaussian process metamodel clearly, suggests that further research is indicated on the long-term impact of these therapies on disease progression, the proportion of patients dropping off therapy and the relationship between the EDSS, quality of life and costs of care.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The applied methodology points towards using more sophisticated metamodelling approaches in order to obtain greater accuracy in EVPI estimation. Programming requirements, software availability and statistical accuracy should be considered when choosing between metamodelling techniques. Simpler, more accessible techniques are open to greater predictive error, whilst sophisticated methodologies may enhance accuracy within non-linear models, but are considerably more difficult to implement and may require specialist expertise. These techniques have been applied in only a limited number of cases hence their suitability for use in EVPI analysis has not yet been demonstrated. A number of areas requiring further research have been highlighted. Further clinical research is required concerning the relationship between the EDSS, costs of care and health outcomes, the rates at which patients drop off therapy and in particular the impact of disease-modifying therapies on the progression of MS. Further methodological research is indicated concerning the inclusion of epidemiological population parameters within the sensitivity analysis; the development of criteria for selecting a metamodelling approach; the application of metamodelling techniques within health economic models and in the specific application to EVI analyses; and the use of metamodelling for EVSI and ENBS analysis."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Shigella remains in the top four pathogens responsible for moderate to severe diarrhoea in children below 5 years of age. The shigella O-specific polysaccharide (O-SP) is a promising vaccine target. We developed a conjugate vaccine prototype incorporating a unique well defined synthetic oligosaccharide hapten, chemically designed for optimal antigenic, conformational, structural, and functional mimicry of the O-SP from Shigella flexneri 2a (SF2a). We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of this original synthetic oligosaccharide-based vaccine candidate, SF2a-TT15, conceived to drive the antibody response towards the key protective determinants of the native lipopolysaccharide antigen, in a first-in-human phase 1 study.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We did a first-in-human, dose-escalating, single-blind, observer-masked, randomised, placebo-controlled study at the Clinical Research Center of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Israel). Participants were healthy adults aged 18-45 years with low titres of serum SF2a-specific IgG antibodies. 64 eligible participants were assigned to one of two cohorts. 32 participants in each of the two cohorts were randomly assigned via computer-generated algorithm in a stepwise manner to receive the 2 μg (cohort 1) and 10 μg oligosaccharide dose (cohort 2) of the SF2a-TT15 vaccine candidate non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide (alum) or matching placebos. The vaccine was administered as three single intramuscular injections into the arm, 28 days apart. The primary outcome was the incidence and severity of adverse events, which were assessed in the intention-to-treat safety population analysis including all participants who were randomly assigned and received at least one vaccine or placebo injection. The immunogenicity endpoints were secondary outcomes and were analysed in all participants who were randomly assigned, received all of the assigned injections before the time of the immunogenicity assessment, and provided blood samples for immunological follow-up (per-protocol immunogenicity analysis). The study is registered with ClinicalStudies.gov, NCT02797236 and is completed.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Of 203 volunteers initially screened, 64 participants were enrolled between Sept 20, 2016, and Sept 26, 2017. In each of the two cohorts, 12 participants received the adjuvanted vaccine, 12 received the non-adjuvanted vaccine and eight received the matching placebo (four each). The SF2a-TT15 glycoconjugate was well tolerated at both doses. No serious or severe adverse events occurred. Overall, seven (88%) of eight to 12 (100%) of 12 in each group of volunteers had one adverse event or more after receiving the study agents with the majority of adverse events, 300 (98%) of 307, considered mild in intensity. Of the seven adverse events defined as moderate in severity, one (nausea) was suspected to be related to the vaccine candidate. At all post-immunisation days and for both oligosaccharide doses, whether adjuvanted or not, SF2a-TT15 induced significantly higher serum IgG anti-SF2a lipopolysaccharide geometric mean titres (GMTs) as compared with baseline or with the corresponding GMTs in placebo recipients (p<0·01). After one injection, the non-adjuvanted 10 μg oligosaccharide dose induced a 27-times increase in IgG GMT (5080 vs 189) and the non-adjuvanted 2 μg oligosaccharide dose induced a five-times increase (1411 vs 283), compared with baseline. Alum enhanced the specific IgG response at 2 μg oligosaccharide dose after the third injection (GMTs 3200 vs 1176, p=0.045).\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      SF2a-TT15 was safe and well tolerated and induced high titres of anti-SF2a LPS IgG antibodies. These results support further evaluation of this original synthetic oligosaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine candidate for safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy in target populations.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      The European Union Seventh Framework Programme."

            "abstract": "Emerflu is an inactivated, split-virion pandemic preparedness vaccine, containing 30 μg of hemagglutinin (HA) and 600 μg of aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. It is administered in two doses, 3 weeks apart. Only moderate immunogenicity was evident from clinical studies with the vaccine in adults, and HA antibody responses were below the criteria established by the EMA and US FDA for licensure. With the exception of Australia, the vaccine remains unlicensed. Further clinical development appears to have been suspended, and newer adjuvants such as MF59 and AS03 have since demonstrated safety and superior immunogenicity with lower HA doses. Emerflu is symbolic of the failure of aluminum salts as an adjuvant for influenza vaccines. Reasons for this failure are unclear, and may reflect problems with the adjuvant-antigen complex or interference in the immune response by heterosubtypic immunity."

In two studies, a total of 261 healthy adults (≤60 years old) were randomized to receive two doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 μg of hemagglutinin (HA) or nonadjuvanted vaccine containing 15 μg of hemagglutinin (in study A) or 3.75 μg of hemagglutinin (in study B) 21 days apart. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody, memory B-cell, and CD4+/CD8+ T-cell responses were characterized up to 1 year following dose 1. We also assessed the effects of age and seasonal influenza vaccination history. AS03-adjuvanted (3.75 μg HA) vaccine and nonadjuvanted vaccine at 15 μg but not at 3.75 μg HA elicited HI antibody responses persisting at levels that continued to meet European licensure criteria through month 12. At month 12, the geometric mean titer for AS03-adjuvanted vaccine was similar to that for nonadjuvanted (15-μg) vaccine in study A (1:86 and 1:88, respectively) and higher than that for nonadjuvanted (3.75-μg) vaccine in study B (1:77 and 1:35, respectively). A(H1N1)pdm09-specific CD4+ T-cell and B-cell responses were stronger in AS03-adjuvanted groups and persisted only in these groups for 12 months at levels exceeding prevaccination frequencies. Advancing age and a seasonal vaccination history tended to reduce HI antibody and memory B-cell responses and, albeit less consistently, CD4+ T-cell responses. Thus, AS03 seemed to enhance the persistence of humoral and cell-mediated responses to A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine, allowing for antigen sparing and mitigating potential negative effects of age and previous seasonal vaccination.

Recently, we developed a hydrogen peroxide-inactivated vaccine against S. agalactiae with moderate efficacy, with the possibility to improve vaccine efficacy by adding adjuvants. The current study compared the efficacy of aluminum hydroxide and Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) incorporated into a novel hydrogen peroxide-inactivated intraperitoneal vaccine against S. agalactiae for Nile tilapia fingerlings. The relative percentage survival (RPS) for aluminum hydroxide-adjuvanted vaccine (59.3%), and FIA-adjuvanted vaccine (77.8%) were higher than the vaccine without adjuvant (40.7%). In addition, fish immunized with aluminum hydroxide-adjuvanted vaccine had significantly higher levels of specific antibodies than control fish at 4 weeks post vaccination (wpv). Blood lymphocytes counts showed a decrease in vaccinated groups when compared to control fish, suggesting white cells migration to the tissues where antigen presentation is ongoing. Fish that received FIA-adjuvanted vaccine exhibited persistence of adjuvant deposits on intraperitoneal surfaces for at least 4 wpv that may be related to its superior performance compared to aluminum hydroxide adjuvanted vaccine, which did not evidence any type of deposit at any sampling times. The results observed in this study demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide-inactivated vaccine administered with either aluminum hydroxide or FIA induce optimal levels of protection, with a superior performance for FIA vaccine, which could be a good alternative to conventional formaldehyde-inactivated vaccines against S. agalactiae, due to its shorter manufacture time, and less toxicity."

Approximately 400,000 people in the United States are affected by MS. Although several forms of MS exist, the most common course is known as relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), which affects about 85% of MS patients. This form of MS is characterized by relapses of neurologic symptoms followed by periods of recovery. Progression of disease can lead to increasingly severe disability. Since the introduction of immunomodulatory biologic agents, such as interferon betas and glatiramer acetate, treatment has helped to change the course of the disease. Under budgetary constraints, health services payers are challenged to differentiate the economic value of these agents for formulary selection and/or placement.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate the 2-year cost-effectiveness of 4 disease modifying drugs (DMDs) used as first-line treatment of RRMS: glatiramer acetate, interferon (IFN) Beta-1a IM injection, IFN Beta-1a SC injection, and IFN Beta-1b SC injection.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An Excel-based model was developed to compare the relative effectiveness and cost components of relapses, disability progression, and DMDs in the treatment of RRMS over a 2-year time horizon. The relative risk reduction (RRR) method was used to compare reduction in relapse rates and disease progression data from pivotal randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials of the DMDs. RRRs for relapses and disability progression, respectively, were calculated as the relative difference (treatment vs. placebo) in relapse rates and disease progression rates from placebo-controlled clinical trials. These RRRs were applied to the weighted average rates of relapse and number of disability progression steps seen in the placebo arms of the pivotal studies. The evaluation was conducted from the perspective of a U.S. health care payer (only direct medical costs considered). Medical savings were calculated as costs saved due to relapses avoided and prevention in disability progression steps. In the base case analysis, we assumed 89.4% persistence, a cost per relapse of $4,682, and a cost per disability progression step of $1,788. Monthly cost of therapy was defined as wholesale acquisition cost ($0 contractual discounts and $25 patient copayment assumed in the base case analysis) plus routine monitoring costs as assessed by an expert panel. The primary economic endpoint was cost per relapse avoided. Costs and outcomes occurring in the second year were discounted 3% to bring to 2008 present values. Oneway and multiway probabilistic (Monte Carlo) sensitivity analyses were conducted on key input variables to assess their impact on cost per relapse avoided.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Without DMD treatment, patients were predicted to experience 2.55 relapses and 0.44 disability progression steps over a 2-year period (discounted values).

The 2-year reductions in disability progression steps for treatment with glatiramer acetate, IFN Beta-1a IM injection, IFN Beta-1a SC injection, and IFN Beta-1b were 0.05, 0.15, 0.12, and 0.11, respectively. In the base case analysis, IFN Beta-1a SC injection, IFN Beta-1b SC injection, and glatiramer acetate had the most favorable costs per relapse avoided ($80,589; $87,061; and $88,310; respectively) and IFN Beta-1a IM injection had the least favorable cost-effectiveness ratio ($141,721 per relapse avoided). Sensitivity analyses showed that these results were robust to changes in key input parameters, such as the number of relapses and disease progression steps in untreated patients, the RRR in clinical relapse and progression rates, the rate of persistence, the average cost of relapse, and the average cost of a disease progression step.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This evaluation suggests that IFN Beta-1a SC injection, IFN Beta-1b SC injection, and glatiramer acetate represent the most cost-effective DMDs for the treatment of RRMS, where cost-effectiveness is defined as cost per relapse avoided, assuming that (a) the RRR in relapses and disease progression steps calculated from multiple DMD placebo-controlled clinical trials reflect real differences among DMDs over 2 years; and (b) resource unit costs derived from published sources reflect economic consequences of relapses and disease progression."

            "abstract": "Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is one of the oldest and most commonly administered vaccines worldwide. Different BCG vaccine strains exist as a result of genetic changes that occurred during repeated subculture in different countries before lyophilisation was introduced for storage of seed lots in the 1960s. Increasing evidence suggests that these genetically divergent BCG vaccine strains are associated with different protective efficacy against tuberculosis (TB), different rates of adverse events and variable susceptibility to anti-tuberculous drugs. Information on which BCG vaccine strains are used in each country worldwide has not previously been collated. This report summarises data from the EuroTB network and from WHO/UNICEF in the first map depicting the BCG vaccine strains used globally. In 83 (44%) of 188 countries, more than one BCG vaccine strain was used during the five year period. In the countries that used only one strain, BCG Denmark was used in 32, BCG Russia/Bulgaria in 30, BCG Japan in eight, BCG Connaught in two. Twelve countries used their locally-produced BCG vaccine strains. The considerable variation in BCG vaccine strains used worldwide highlights the importance of documenting the particular vaccine strain used on an individual, local and national level. This is important for the interpretation of changes in the epidemiology of adverse events after BCG immunisation, for the management of adverse events after BCG immunisation, to interpret differences in the protective efficacy of BCG, and to inform the design of trials investigating novel TB vaccines."

            "abstract": "The producers of influenza vaccines are not capable today to meet the global demand for an influenza vaccine in case of pandemic, so the World Health Organization recommends to develop the own influenza vaccine production in each country. A domestic preservative- and adjuvant-free trivalent split vaccine against seasonal influenza was developed at the Research Institute for Biological Safety Problems. The paper presents the results of assessing safety and immunogenicity of the influenza split vaccine after single immunization of healthy volunteers aged 18-50 years in the course of Phase I Clinical Trials. This study was randomized, blind, and placebo-controlled. The volunteers were intramuscularly vaccinated with a dose of split vaccine or placebo. The study has shown that all local and systemic reactions had low degree of manifestation and short-term character, so there was no need in medication. Serious side effects were not observed. On day 21 post vaccination the portion of vaccinated persons with fourfold seroconversions to influenza А/H1N1pdm09 virus was 100.0%, to influenza А/H3N2 virus-95.5%, to influenza B virus-81.8%, and in placebo group this index was 0%. Seroprotection rates against influenza А/H1N1pdm09, А/H3N2 and B viruses were 95.5, 86.3, and 72.7%, respectively. Geometric mean titers (GMT) of antibodies by day 21 post vaccination reached 175.7 for influenza А/H1N1pdm09 virus, 64.2 for influenza А/H3N2 virus, and 37.6 for influenza B virus; in placebo group GMT growth was not observed. So, the seasonal influenza split vaccine is well tolerated and fits all immunogenicity criteria for human influenza vaccines."

In addition to intervention, increasing interest is focusing on immunomodulatory therapy for recurrent RTIs, which indicate a reduced defense capacity of the respiratory mucosa. LW 50020, an oral immunomodulator that contains the antigens of seven bacteria common in RTIs, has reduced the number, duration, and severity of RTIs in children and adults. This 56-week placebo-controlled, double-blind study in 188 children investigated whether the efficacy of the standard schedule (immunization cycle + one booster cycle) would be enhanced by additional booster cycles. Efficacy and safety over the long term were also assessed. The rate of infection was reduced by 50% with the standard schedule and could not be further decreased by two consecutive booster cycles. With both schedules, this reduction was sustained during a 28-week treatment-free observation period that followed the 28-week treatment period. The number of adverse drug reactions was low, and all were transient, expected, and nonserious. These results confirm that LW 50020 is an effective and safe strategy for RTIs."

However, with the increasing availability of historical data, incorporating existing information into trials with small sample sizes is appealing in order to increase the power.

We used power priors derived from historical individual control data for baseline parameters of Weibull and piecewise exponential models, while we used a mixture prior to summarise aggregate information obtained on the relative treatment effect.

Patients with acute respiratory illness presenting to inpatient and outpatient facilities affiliated with four collaborating institutions were prospectively recruited, consented, and tested for influenza. Analyses were restricted to October 2009 through April 2010, when pandemic vaccine was available. Patients testing positive for pandemic influenza by real-time RT-PCR were cases; those testing negative were controls. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated in logistic regression models adjusted for study community, patient age, timing of illness, insurance status, enrollment site, and presence of high-risk medical conditions. Pandemic virus was detected in 1,011 (15%) of 6,757 enrolled patients. Fifteen (1%) of 1,011 influenza positive cases and 1,042 (18%) of 5,746 test-negative controls had record-verified pandemic vaccination >14 days prior to illness onset. Adjusted effectiveness (95% confidence interval) for pandemic vaccines combined was 56% (23%, 75%). Adjusted effectiveness for inactivated vaccines alone (79% of total) was 62% (25%, 81%) overall and 32% (-92%, 76%), 89% (15%, 99%), and -6% (-231%, 66%) in those aged 0.5 to 9, 10 to 49, and 50+ years, respectively. Effectiveness for the live attenuated vaccine in those aged 2 to 49 years was only demonstrated if vaccination >7 rather than >14 days prior to illness onset was considered (61%∶ 12%, 82%). Inactivated non-adjuvanted pandemic vaccines offered significant protection against confirmed pandemic influenza-associated medical care visits in young adults."

            "abstract": "Both seasonal and pandemic influenza cause considerable morbidity and mortality globally. In addition, the ongoing threat of new, unpredictable influenza pandemics from emerging variant strains cannot be underestimated. Recently bioCSL (previously known as CSL Biotherapies) sponsored a symposium 'New Wisdom to Defy an Old Enemy' at the 4th Influenza Vaccines for the World Congress in Valencia, Spain. This symposium brought together a renowned faculty of experts to discuss lessons from past experience, novel influenza vaccine developments, and new methods to increase vaccine acceptance and coverage. Specific topics reviewed and discussed included new vaccine development efforts focused on improving efficacy via alternative administration routes, dose modifications, improved adjuvants, and the use of master donor viruses. Improved safety was also discussed, particularly the new finding of an excess of febrile reactions isolated to children who received the 2010 Southern Hemisphere (SH) trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). Significant work has been done to both identify the cause and minimize the risk of febrile reactions in children. Other novel prophylactic and therapeutic advances were discussed including immunotherapy. Standard IVIg and hIVIg have been used in ferret studies and human case reports with promising results. New adjuvants, such as ISCOMATRIX™ adjuvant, were noted to provide single-dose, prolonged protection with seasonal vaccine after lethal H5N1 virus challenge in a ferret model of human influenza disease. The data suggest that adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines may provide broader protection than unadjuvanted vaccines. The use of an antigen-formulated vaccine to induce broad protection between pandemics that could bridge the gap between pandemic declaration and the production of a homologous vaccine was also discussed. Finally, despite the availability of effective vaccines, most current efforts to increase influenza vaccine coverage rates to higher levels (i.e., above 70-80%) have been ineffective in highly developed countries where the vaccine is used, hindered by the public's skepticism towards vaccines in general. New educational and social media methods to increase vaccine acceptance and coverage were discussed. While the first priority should be the development of improved influenza vaccines, a particular focus on the aging global population is critical. It is also important to draw lessons from other academic disciplines that can help to inform vaccine education programs, policy, and communication. By tailoring communications and patient education using an understanding of cognitive bias and the model of preferred cognitive styles, the likelihood of effecting desirable health decisions can be maximized, leading to improved vaccine coverage and control of influenza and other vaccine-preventable diseases."

            "abstract": "Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is an important protease that is widely expressed on the surface of human cells and plays a key role in immune-regulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, cell adhesion, and apoptosis by targeting different substrates. DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) are commonly used as hypoglycemic agents. However, in addition to their hypoglycemic effect, DPP-4i have also shown potent activities in the cardiovascular system, particularly in the regulation of blood pressure (BP). Previous studies have shown that the regulatory actions of DPP-4i in controlling BP are complex and that the mechanisms involved include the functional activities of the nerves, kidneys, hormones, blood vessels, and insulin. Recent work has also shown that inflammation is closely associated with the elevation of BP, and that the inhibition of DPP-4 can reduce BP by regulating the function of the immune system, by reducing inflammatory reactions and by improving oxidative stress. In this review, we describe the potential anti-hypertensive effects of DPP-4i and discuss potential new anti-hypertensive therapies. Our analysis indicated that DPP-4i treatment has a mild anti-hypertensive effect as a monotherapy and causes a significant reduction in BP when used in combined treatments. However, the combination of DPP-4i with high-dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) can lead to increased BP. We suggest that DPP-4i improves vascular endothelial function in hypertensive patients by suppressing inflammatory responses and by alleviating oxidative stress. In addition, DPP-4i can also regulate BP by activating the sympathetic nervous system, interfering with the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), regulating Na/H2O metabolism, and attenuating insulin resistance (IR)."

Influenza vaccines are the primary method for the control of influenza and its complications. We conducted a multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of H1N1 vaccine (Green Cross Co.) in young adults (18 to 64 years) and the elderly (≥ 65 years) using a two-dose regimen, with the doses administered 21 days apart. Three different regimens of hemagglutinin antigen were comparatively analyzed: 3.75 μg (MF59 adjuvanted) versus 7.5 μg (MF59 adjuvanted) versus 15 μg (nonadjuvanted) in young adults and 3.75 μg (MF59 adjuvanted) versus 7.5 μg (MF59 adjuvanted) in the elderly. In young adults, all three vaccine regimens met the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMA) criteria after the first dose. In the elderly, on day 21 after the first dose, the rates of seroprotection and seroconversion were significantly higher for the 7.5-μg dose of MF59 adjuvanted vaccine than for the 3.75-μg dose (58.0% versus 44.3% [P = 0.03] and 53.7% versus 37.2% [P < 0.01], respectively). After the second dose, the geometric mean titer (GMT) increment was blunted with a 15-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine, whereas the GMT increased about 2-fold with MF59 adjuvanted vaccines. In conclusion, a single 7.5-μg dose of MF59 adjuvanted vaccine would have a practical advantage over a two-dose, 3.75-μg, MF59 adjuvanted vaccine priming schedule. Following a two-dose priming schedule, the increase in hemagglutinin inhibition titers was higher with MF59 adjuvanted vaccine than with nonadjuvanted vaccine."

However, age had a larger effect than naive CD4 T cells, i.e., in comparing young and elderly groups the log antibody titer decreased by 1.73 due to the increase in age but only 0.40 due to the decrease in naive CD4 T cells.

The mean rate of metabolic recovery by three distinct measures was similar between groups, and the sample had 80% power to detect differences of 14% to 29% in these measures.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We found no evidence that adjunctive bicarbonate improved clinical outcome in children with severe DKA. The rate of metabolic recovery and complications were similar in patients treated with and without bicarbonate, and prolonged hospitalizations were noted in the bicarbonate group. We conclude that adjunctive bicarbonate is unnecessary and potentially disadvantageous in severe pediatric DKA."

            "abstract": "Aluminum-containing adjuvants used in vaccine formulations suffer from low cellular immunity, severe aggregation, and accumulation in the brain. Conventional aluminosilicates widely used in the chemical industry focus mainly on acidic sites for catalytic applications, but they are rarely used as adjuvants. Reported here is an innovative \"ligand-assisted steric hindrance\" strategy to create a high density of six-coordinate VI Al-OH groups with basicity on dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles as new nanoadjuvants. Compared to four-coordinate IV Al-modified counterparts, VI Al-OH-rich aluminosilicate nanoadjuvants enhance cellular delivery of antigens and provoke stronger cellular immunity. Moreover, the aluminum accumulation in the brain is more reduced than that with a commercial adjuvant. These results show that coordination chemistry can be used to control the adjuvanticity, providing new understanding in the development of next-generation vaccine adjuvants."

            "abstract": "The immunogenicity benefit of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) adjuvanted by squalene over non-adjuvanted aqueous IIV was explored in a meta-analysis involving 49 randomised trials published between 1999 and 2017, and 22,470 eligible persons of all age classes. Most vaccines contained 15 μg viral haemagglutinin per strain. Adjuvanted IIV mostly contained 9.75 mg squalene per dose. Homologous pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean titres (GMTs) of haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody were recorded for 290 single influenza (sub-)type arms. The adjuvant effect was expressed as the ratio of post-vaccination GMTs between squalene-IIV and aqueous IIV (GMTR, 145 estimates). GMTRs > 1.0 favoured squalene-IIV over aqueous IIV. For all influenza (sub-)types, the adjuvant effect proved negatively associated with pre-vaccination GMT and mean age. The adjuvant effect appeared most pronounced in young children (mean age < 2.5 years) showing an average GMTR of 3.7 (95% CI: 2.5 to 5.5). With increasing age, GMTR values gradually decreased towards 1.4 (95% CI: 1.0 to 1.9) in older adults. Heterologous antibody titrations simulating mismatch between vaccine and circulating virus (30 GMTR estimates) again showed a larger adjuvant effect at young age. GMT values and their variances were converted to antibody-predicted protection rates using an evidence-based clinical protection curve. The adjuvant effect was expressed as the protection rate differences, which showed similar age patterns as corresponding GMTR values. However for influenza B, the adjuvant effect lasted longer than for influenza A, possibly due to a generally later influenza B virus exposure. Collectively, this meta-analysis indicates the highest benefit of squalene-IIV over aqueous IIV in young children and decreasing benefit with progressing age. This trend is similar for seasonal influenza (sub-)types and the 2009 pandemic strain, by both homologous and heterologous titration. The impact of pre-seasonal immunity on vaccine effectiveness, and its implications for age-specific vaccination recommendations, are discussed."

            "abstract": "Among the different drugs used for sparing steroids in steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) with frequent relapses and steroid dependency, levamisole is the least toxic and the least expensive. However, it is neither approved for this indication nor widely used in Europe. This may be explained by the difficulty in obtaining levamisole in some countries and the lack of good quality evidence for its effectiveness. Evidence is limited to three clinical trials that all suffered from methodological limitations. Statistical synthesis of these trials showed that levamisole reduces the risk of a relapse during treatment (relative risk 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.45-0.79). From the available information, no conclusions can be drawn on the steroid-sparing effect, the long-term efficacy, and safety, as well as possible differences in efficacy in different subgroups of SSNS patients. The confirmation of a favorable effect of levamisole on the reduction of the frequency of relapses and on sparing steroids in an adequately powered, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center clinical trial will promote consensus on the place of levamisole in the treatment of SSNS of childhood. Follow-up should be at least 1 year to evaluate long-term efficacy and side effects. If the results of such a clinical trial confirm the beneficial effects of levamisole in nephrotic syndrome, this may allow registration for this indication and interest companies other than Jansen-Cilag, which only recently has decided to stop its production."

Children with stage 2 tuberculous meningitis received oral thalidomide for 28 days in a dose-escalating study, in addition to standard four-drug antituberculosis therapy, corticosteroids, and specific treatment of complications such as raised intracranial pressure. Clinical and laboratory evaluations were carried out. Fifteen patients (median age, 34 months) were enrolled. Thalidomide was administered via nasogastric tube in a dosage of 6 mg/kg/day, 12 mg/kg/day, or 24 mg/kg/day. The only adverse events possibly related to the study drug were transient skin rashes in two patients. Levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the cerebrospinal fluid decreased markedly during thalidomide therapy. Clinical outcome and neurologic imaging showed greater improvement than that experienced with historical controls. Thalidomide appeared safe and well tolerated in children with stage 2 tuberculous meningitis and could have important anti-inflammatory effects. These promising results have led us to embark on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy of thalidomide in tuberculous meningitis."

Here, we explored the impact of TLR agonists on the B cell response to a prototypic thymus-independent (TI) antigen: a Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide (PS). In adult mice, all TLR agonists (and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides [ODN] in particular) enhance the PS antibody response, provided that their administration is delayed until the second day after PS vaccination. In infant mice, CpG ODN not only potentiated the PS3 antibody response but also restored responsiveness to PS3 vaccination. Moreover, the immune protection induced by the plain PS3 vaccine adjuvanted by CpG ODN was comparable to that conferred by the conjugate vaccine in terms of efficiency and longevity. CpG ODN exert their adjuvant effect by increasing the survival rate of antigen-stimulated B cells as well as the output of plasmablasts.

There was an average 16-fold increase in HI titer for the three components of the vaccine with no significant differences among strains. The increased serum antibodies correlated with an increase in protection against infection. The threonyl-MDP (t-MDP) component of the adjuvant played no role in this activity. The vehicle, in contrast, was so effective that it could be diluted 1:202 (in the presence of (t-MDP) and still retain a statistically significant effect. Vaccine and adjuvant could be stored together at 4 degrees C for 2 years without a statistically significant change in potency. Mice were given a priming immunization with TIV, PBS, or adjuvanted TIV (AIV). A year later, the mice were boosted with heterotypic TIV or AIV. The nature of the priming immunization made no difference in the strong antibody response to an AIV boost. However, priming significantly improved the response to TIV with AIV being the best primer. The enhancement in the antibody response to AlShanghai of the unprimed (PBS) elderly mice caused by AIV (14-fold improvement over TIV) was similar to that in young mice.

Two studies tested intravenous homeopathic complex preparations containing Echinacea angustifolia D1 (study 1) and D4 (study 5). Two studies (2 and 3a) tested oral alcoholic extracts of roots of E. purpurea, one study an extract of E. pallida roots (study 3b), and one study an extract of E. purpurea herb (study 4). Test and placebo preparations were applied for four (study 5) or five (studies 1-4) consecutive days. The primary outcome measure for immunomodulatory activity was the relative phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PNG), measured in studies 1 and 2 with a microscopic method and in studies 3, 4, and 5 with two different cytometric methods. The secondary outcome measure was the number of leukocytes in peripheral venous blood. Safety was assessed by a screening program of blood and other objective parameters as well as by documentation of all subjective side effects. In studies 1 and 2 the phagocytic activity of PNG was significantly enhanced compared with placebo [maximal stimulation 22.7% (95% confidence interval 17.5-27.9%) and 54.0% (8.4-99.6%), respectively], while in the other studies no significant effects were observed. Analysis of intragroup differences revealed significant changes in phagocytic activity during the observation periods in five test and three control groups. Leukocyte number was not influenced significantly in any study. Side effects due to the test preparations could not be detected. Our studies provide evidence for immunomodulatory activity of the homeopathic combination tested in study 1 and the E. purpureae radix extract tested in study 2. The negative results of the other three studies are difficult to interpret due to the different methods for measuring phagocytosis, the relevant changes in phagocytic activity within most placebo and treatment groups during the observation period, and the small sample sizes. Future studies should be performed on patients rather than healthy volunteers and use standardized or chemically defined monopreparations of Echinacea."

            "abstract": "Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been used successfully in a number of immunological diseases because of their immunomodulatory effect. Preliminary studies have shown them to be effective in the treatment of idiopathic ulcerative colitis. We assessed the efficacy or oral chloroquine in the treatment of idiopathic ulcerative colitis of mild to moderate severity in a randomized, controlled, blinded trial. Forty patients were assigned to receive chloroquine phosphate (500 mg/day) or sulfasalazine (3 g/day). The outcome of therapy was monitored at the end of 2 wk and 4 wk by symptom assessment and sigmoidoscopic examination. An objective scoring system was used for the evaluation, and patients were categorized into those showing complete remission, partially responding, and nonresponders. There was a sequential improvement in the individual scores as well as total activity score in both groups at 2 wk and 4 wk. With chloroquine, 12 patients (60%) showed complete remission at 4 wk, whereas six (30%) had a partial response. With sulfasalazine, 11 patients (55%) had complete remission at 4 wk, and eight (40%) showed partial response. There was no significant difference in the response to the two drugs (p > 0.05). Five (25%) patients in the chloroquine group had side effects, compared with eight (40%) in the sulfasalazine group (p > 0.05). All side effects were minor and transient, not requiring withdrawal of the drug. We conclude that short-duration chloroquine therapy is a safe and effective alternative to sulfasalazine in the treatment of mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis."

There was no difference in antibody response to either influenza A or B in 64 patients who received GM-CSF at vaccination, compared with the 53 who did not. In the subgroup of allogeneic SCT patients, HAI showed that the response rate to the influenza B vaccine was significantly higher in the treatment group (P<.05). ELISA showed that autologous SCT patients with breast cancer who received GM-CSF had a better response to influenza A (P<.05) and B (P<.01).

The complex showed immunomodulatory properties in mice, rats, and chickens, inducing maturation and differentiation of thymocytes. It was recently found that Colostrinin is a cytokine-like factor that acts as an inducer of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and other cytokines in human peripheral blood and cord blood leukocyte cultures and has psycho-immuno-enhancing activity in volunteers. These observations prompted us to study the effect of Colostrinin on patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Forty six AD patients were divided into 3 groups and randomly assigned to receive orally either Colostrinin (100 microg per tablet, every second day), commercially available bioorganic selenium (100 microg selenium per tablet, every second day) or placebo tablets. One cycle of the treatment lasted 3 weeks and was separated from the next cycle by a 2 week hiatus. Each patient received 10 cycles of treatment during the year of the clinical trial. Outcomes were assessed by psychiatrists blinded to the treatment assignment. Eight of the 15 AD patients treated with Colostrinin improved and in the 7 others the disease had stabilized. In contrast, none of the 31 patients from the selenium or placebo groups with similar mild or moderate AD improved. The administration of selenium promoted stabilization in 13 of the 15 patients, whereas in the placebo group only 8 of the 16 patients were stabilized at the 12 month trials end-evaluation. Colostrinin was found to be a remarkably safe drug. Mild and transient effects were anxiety, stimulation, insomnia, and tiredness. The results obtained showed that oral administration of Colostrinin improves the outcome of AD patients with mild to moderate dementia. The results are very encouraging and deserve further research."

We had offered a monovalent non-adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccine to transplant recipients. Here we compared the pre- and post-vaccination seroresponses of 151 transplant recipients to that of 71 hemodialysis patients and 30 healthy controls. Baseline seroprotection was similar between groups but was significantly different at 1 month (44, 56, and 87%, respectively). Seroconversion was significantly less common for transplant recipients (32%) than dialysis patients (45%) and healthy controls (77%). After adjusting for age and gender, dialysis patients were significantly more likely (2.7-fold) to achieve new seroprotection than transplant recipients. The likelihood of seroprotection in transplant recipients was significantly reduced by mycophenolate use (adjusted odds ratio 0.24), in a dose-dependent manner, and by reduced eGFR (adjusted odds ratio 0.16 for worst to best). Seroprotection and geometric mean antibody titers increased substantially in 49 transplant recipients who subsequently received the 2010 seasonal influenza vaccine. Thus, patients requiring renal replacement therapy had reduced seroresponses to vaccination with the monovalent vaccine compared with healthy controls.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The availability of H5N1 vaccines that can elicit a broad cross-protective immunity against different currently circulating clade 2 H5N1 viruses is a pre-requisite for the development of a successful pre-pandemic vaccination strategy. In this regard, it has recently been shown that adjuvantation of a recombinant clade 1 H5N1 inactivated split-virion vaccine with an oil-in-water emulsion-based adjuvant system also promoted cross-immunity against a recent clade 2 H5N1 isolate (A/Indonesia/5/2005, subclade 2.1). Here we further analyse the cross-protective potential of the vaccine against two other recent clade 2 isolates (A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 and A/Anhui/1/2005 which are, as defined by WHO, representatives of subclades 2.2 and 2.3 respectively).\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      Two doses of the recombinant A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1, clade 1) vaccine were administered 21 days apart to volunteers aged 18-60 years. We studied the cross-clade immunogenicity of the lowest antigen dose (3.8 microg haemagglutinin) given with (N = 20) or without adjuvant (N = 20). Immune responses were assessed at 21 days following the first and second vaccine doses and at 6 months following first vaccination. Vaccination with two doses of 3.8 microg of the adjuvanted vaccine induced four-fold neutralising seroconversion rates in 85% of subjects against A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (subclade 2.2) and 75% of subjects against A/Anhui/1/2005 (subclade 2.3) recombinant strains. There was no response induced against these strains in the non-adjuvanted group. At 6 months following vaccination, 70% and 60% of subjects retained neutralising antibodies against the recombinant subclade 2.2 and 2.3 strains, respectively and 40% of subjects retained antibodies against the recombinant subclade 2.1 A/Indonesia/5/2005 strain.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In addition to antigen dose-sparing, adjuvantation of inactivated split H5N1 vaccine promotes broad and persistent cross-clade immunity which is a pre-requisite for a pre-pandemic vaccine.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00309634."

            "abstract": "Immunosenescence is characterised by reduced B and T cell responses. Evidence shows that booster vaccinations are less effective in elderly people, but data on the efficacy of primary immunisation are sparse. We conducted a monocentric, open label, phase IV trial to compare immune responses to primary vaccinations using the inactivated, adjuvanted Japanese Encephalitis vaccine by 30 elderly people (mean 69, range 61-78 years) and 30 younger people (mean 24, range 18-30 years). Humoral and cellular immune responses were analysed in relation to age and cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity. Vaccine-specific antibody titres were significantly lower in elderly participants and 47% of them were non- or low responders after the two doses of the vaccine neo-antigen. The reduced humoral immune responses in elderly people correlated with reduced cytokine production, such as interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in vitro, as well as higher frequencies of late-differentiated effector and effector memory T cells and T regulatory cells. These cellular changes and lower antibody titres were particularly prominent in CMV-seropositive elderly participants. If primary vaccination before the age of 60 is not possible, elderly patients may require different vaccination strategies to ensure sufficient long-lasting immunity, such as adapted or accelerated schedules and the use of different adjuvants."

Post-Dose 2, 96.0% of vaccinees in the H5N1-AS03 group demonstrated a four-fold increase in neutralising antibody titres against the vaccine strain A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and 91.4% against strain A/Indonesia/05/2005.

Lot-to-lot consistency of the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine combinations was demonstrated. The AS03-adjuvanted vaccine was well tolerated, induced a high frequency of immune responses to the vaccine strain, allowed antigen sparing and promoted cross-clade immunity.

            "abstract": "An adjuvanted vaccine containing inactivated equine influenza, herpesvirus antigens, and tetanus toxoid was administered to young seronegative foals of 8 months of age by deep intramuscular injection in the neck (Group A). The first two vaccinations were given 4 weeks apart. The third was administered 6 months later. Another group of foals (Group B) was vaccinated according to the same scheme at the same time with monovalent equine herpes virus (EHV) vaccine (EHV1.4) vaccine. Antibody responses to the equine influenza (single radial haemolysis; SRH) and tetanus (ToBi ELISA) components of the vaccines were examined from first vaccination until 1 year after the third vaccination. The influenza components of the combination vaccine induced high antibody titres at two weeks after the second vaccination whereafter titres declined until the time of the third vaccination. After the third vaccination, the titres rose rapidly again to remain high for at least 1 year. Antibody titres against tetanus peaked only after the third vaccination but remained high enough to offer protective immunity for at least 1 year. Foals vaccinated with monovalent EHV1.4 remained seronegative for influenza and tetanus throughout the study. Four and a half months after the third vaccination of groups A and B, a third group of animals was vaccinated twice with monovalent EHV1.4 vaccine 4 weeks apart (Group C). Two weeks after the administration of the second dose in the later group, all groups (A, B, C and an unvaccinated control group D) were challenged with EHV-4. Vaccinated foals (Group A, B, C) showed a clear reduction of clinical symptoms and virus excretion after EHV-4 challenge compared with the unvaccinated control foals. No difference could be demonstrated among the vaccinated groups, suggesting that the combination vaccine protects as well as the monovalent vaccine. In EHV1.4-vaccinated foals both antigenic fractions induced clear protection up to 6 months after vaccination (9). It can therefore be anticipated that the efficacy of the combination vaccine against EHV-1 challenge is similar to the efficacy against EHV-1 induced by EHV1.4 vaccination."

            "abstract": "Despite the availability of potent antitubercular drugs, tuberculosis (TB) still remains one of the world's leading causes of death. The current antitubercular therapy (ATT) suffers from a drawback of longer duration that imposes a major challenge of patient non compliance and resistance development. The current scenario necessitates alternative strategies with potential to shorten treatment duration that could pave the way for improved clinical outcomes. In recent years, host directed adjunctive therapies have raised considerable attention and emerged as a promising intervention which targets clinically relevant biological pathways in hosts to modulate pathological immune responses. Few of the approved drugs namely statins, metformin, ibuprofen, aspirin, valproic acid, adalimumab, bevacizumab, zileuton and vitamin D3 have shown promising results in clinical outcomes during their preliminary screening in TB patients and can be potentially repurposed as antitubercular drugs. This review highlights clinical and non clinical evidences of some already existing drug and their targets in hosts that could help in shortening treatment duration and reducing bacterial burden at minimal doses."

Evaluation was based on those whose immunization records showed that they had received either three doses of an adsorbed DT vaccine (n = 388) or a non-adsorbed DT-pertussis vaccine (DTP) (n = 69) for primary series vaccination. No differences in systemic reactions to the booster between the two groups were observed. Local reactions were significantly (p < 0.001) more common 1 day after vaccination in children who had received DT for primary series vaccination: redness, 73% compared with 23%; swelling, 56% versus 15%; and itching, 47% versus 21%. One and 2 weeks after the booster, itching was still more pronounced in the group who had received DT for primary series vaccination (p < 0.001 and 0.014, respectively). The study indicates that there was a real basis for the increase in spontaneous notifications of local side-effects to the school DT booster in Sweden. The most likely cause for the increase seems to be the aluminium adjuvant in the vaccine given for primary vaccination, a late and unexpected consequence of a change in the infant immunization programme."

Eighteen healthy adults without present or past H. pylori infection were enrolled in a double blind, randomized, ascending dose study to receive either urease (60 mg), or urease (60 mg) + LT (5 or 25 microg). The immunization preparation was administered per rectum on days 0, 14 and 28. Serum, stool and saliva anti-urease and anti-LT IgG and IgA antibodies (Abs) were measured and urease-specific and LT-specific antigen secreting cells (ASCs) were counted in peripheral blood at baseline and 7 (ASC counts) or 14 days (antibody levels) after each dosing. Peripheral blood lymphoproliferation assays were also performed at baseline and at the end of the study. Rectally delivered urease and LT were well tolerated. Among the 12 subjects assigned to urease+LT, 2 (16.7%) developed anti-urease IgG Abs, 1 (8.3%) developed anti-urease IgA Abs, and 3 (25%) showed urease-specific IgA(+) ASCs. Immune responses to LT were more vigorous, especially in subjects exposed to 5 microg LT. In the urease+ 5 microg LT group, anti-LT IgG and IgA Abs developed in 60 and 80% of the subjects, respectively, while LT-specific IgG(+) and IgA(+) ASCs were detected in all subjects. The magnitude of the anti-LT response was much higher than the response to urease. No IgA anti-urease or anti-LT Abs were detected in stool or saliva and lymphocyte proliferative responses to urease were unsatisfactory. In conclusion, rectal delivery of 5 microg LT is safe and induces vigorous systemic anti-LT immune responses. Further studies are needed to determine if LT can be an effective adjuvant for rectally delivered antigens."

Rarely, adverse side-effects arise from the various factor concentrates that patients on ITT receive or from adjuvant immunosuppressive agents used during ITT. Most adverse side-effects of ITT are related to the need for frequent and repetitive venous access, which often results in the need for central venous access devices (CVAD). These devices greatly facilitate the ability to give repeated doses of factor concentrates to patients and are particularly useful in young children who often have small and poorly functioning peripheral veins. These devices can become infected, can malfunction or can lead to venous thrombosis. These complications, although rarely causing mortality, may lead to significant morbidity including the need to have the devices removed and new ones inserted.

            "abstract": "Influenza remains a serious cause of illness and death among certain populations. Influenza vaccines in use at present are of limited effectiveness due to the high variability of the virus, and trials all over the world are in progress to enhance their immunogenicity. Conflicting results, in fact, have been reported about the immune response to influenza vaccination in diverse populations. In this paper we analyzed the antibody response to the hemagglutinin (HA) of the H3N2 A/Shangai 16/89 strain, which was included into the trivalent 1991-92 influenza vaccine, in four groups of subjects: 8 healthy young, 13 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and 37 elderly healthy people, 9 of whom were treated with thymopentin (TP-5). Our results show levels of anti-HA IgG before vaccination in HIV-infected and elderly people significantly lower than those of normal young subjects. After vaccination, HIV-infected and elderly healthy people showed a significant increase of specific antibodies, whereas a failure in the specific response in normal young subjects was observed, thus differences among the groups were no longer present. Moreover, the spectrotypic analysis of antibody response, by isoelectric focusing and reverse blotting, showed oligoclonal but polymorphic pattern in the majority of subjects, irrespective of the group, and more frequently lack of expansion of the spectrotype after vaccination, thus demonstrating the lack of the recruitment of antigen-specific B cells. Finally, the treatment with TP-5 did not influence the outcome of the vaccination in the group of elderly people. These results further emphasize the limited immunogenicity of influenza vaccination and the inefficacy of TP-5 as immunoadjuvant, in this model of vaccination."

Although trastuzumab and pertuzumab have been approved for clinical use, patients often develop resistance to these therapies. We have advanced a new paradigm in immunotherapy that focuses on humoral responses based on conformational B-cell epitope vaccines.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      The vaccine is comprised of two chimeric HER-2 B-cell peptide vaccines incorporating a \"promiscuous T-cell epitope.\" Patients were immunized with the vaccine constructs emulsified with nor-muramyl-dipeptide adjuvant in a water-in-oil Montanide ISA 720VG vehicle. Eligible patients with metastatic and/or recurrent solid tumors received three inoculations every 3 weeks.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Forty-nine patients with a median of 4 prior lines of chemotherapy received at least 1 vaccination. Twenty-eight patients completed the 3 vaccination regimens. Six patients received 1 six-month boost after the regimen, and one patient received 7 six-month boosts. No serious adverse reactions or dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The vaccine was well tolerated with dose level 2 as the recommended phase II dose. The most common related toxicity in all patients was injection-site reactions (24%). Two patients had a partial response, 14 had stable disease, and 19 had progressive disease.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The study vaccine is safe, exhibits antitumor activity, and shows preliminary indication that peptide vaccination may avoid therapeutic resistance and offer a promising alternative to monoclonal antibody therapies."

            "abstract": "Clinical trials of vaccines differ from those of drugs both practically and ethically. Influenza vaccine trials pose additional challenges which flow from the seasonality of the disease and vaccine programmes and the changeability of circulating strains and epidemic size. Serological correlates are widely used in evaluating influenza vaccines but interpreting such responses is also difficult. Development and testing of vaccines for deployment in an influenza pandemic combines all these obstacles with extreme unpredictability, enormous urgency and the need for very large numbers of doses. Advances in manufacturing technology, diagnostics, identification of stable protective antigens and epitopes, new adjuvants and improved understanding of indirect and downstream effects may help to alleviate these difficulties in the future."

Eight hundred and three patients were entered. Neutrophil recovery was quicker with G-CSF (P < 0.0001), but this did not lead to differences in the number, severity or duration of infections. There were no substantial supportive care savings, although G-CSF patients spent 2 d less in hospital (P = 0.01). Complete remission (CR) rates were similar between arms (73% G-CSF, 75% placebo, P = 0.5), as were reasons for failure (induction death: P = 0.7; resistant disease: P = 0.5) and, for remitters, 5-year disease-free survival (34% vs. 38%, P = 0.3).

            "abstract": "We have designed a therapeutic HIV-1 vaccine concept based on peptides together with the adjuvant CAF01. Peptides represented 15 HLA-supertype-restricted subdominant and conserved CD8 T cell epitopes and three CD4 T-helper cell epitopes. In this phase I clinical trial, safety and immunogenicity were assessed in untreated HIV-1-infected individuals in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa. Twenty-three HIV-1-infected individuals were randomized to receive placebo (n=5) or vaccine (n=18). Safety was appraised by clinical follow-up combined with monitoring of biochemistry, hematology, CD4 T cell counts, and HIV-1 viral loads. T cell immunogenicity was monitored longitudinally by interferon (IFN)-γ ELISpot. New vaccine-specific T cell responses were induced in 6/14 vaccinees for whom ELISpot data were valid. CD4 T cell counts and viral loads were stable. The study shows that therapeutic immunization is feasible and safe in Guinea-Bissau and that it is possible to redirect T cell immunity with CAF01-adjuvanted HIV-1 peptide vaccine during untreated HIV-1 infection in some patients. However, relatively few preexisting and vaccine-induced HIV-1 T cell responses to CD8 T cell epitopes were detected against HIV-1 using IFN-γ ELISpot in this chronically infected African population."

Vaccination is a key countermeasure for disease; however, little data assessing vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the pandemic H1N1 virus are available. We conducted a matched case-control study to assess effectiveness of the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 monovalent vaccine against laboratory-confirmed, medically attended influenza patients. Subjects included in the study were ≥ 10 years of age and were treated at five university hospitals in the Republic of Korea (ROK) from December 2009 through March 2010. For subjects visiting outpatient clinics with influenza-like illness (ILI), real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was used to diagnose 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection. Subjects with positive rRT-PCR were classified as cases, while those testing negative were controls. A valid vaccination corresponded to ≥ 14 days between receiving a dose of vaccine and symptom onset. Overall, 416 ILI subjects were analyzed, and 60 (14.4%) were vaccinated with the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 monovalent vaccine. The overall VE against pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 virus illness after adjustment for age group and presence of chronic medical conditions was 73.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]=49.1-86.1%). Both vaccine formulations (unadjuvanted and MF-59 adjuvanted) showed a statistically significant VE. In conclusion, the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 monovalent vaccine was substantially protective against pandemic influenza in the ROK during the 2009-2010 season."

Common are genomically-encoded resistance mechanisms to polymyxins, specifically colistin (polymyxin E), however, the plasmid-borne mobile colistin resistance-1 (mcr-1) gene has recently been identified and poses a new threat to global public health. Within six months of initial identification in Chinese swine in November 2015, the first human clinical isolation in the US was reported (Apr. 2016). Herein we report successful reversion of mcr-1-driven colistin resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli with adjuvants we previously reported as modulators of chromosomally-encoded colistin resistance. Further screening of our in-house library of nitrogen-dense heterocycles has identified additional chemical scaffolds that actively attenuate colistin resistance. Ultimately, we present a diverse cohort of adjuvants that both sensitize colistin-resistant and colistin-susceptible bacteria to this antibiotic, thus providing a potential avenue to both reduce colistin dosage and toxicity, and overcome colistin resistance."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of these vesicle-in-water-in-oil (v/w/o) gels as delivery vehicles for vaccines. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and haemagglutinin (HA) were used as model antigens in depot and immunogenicity studies respectively. The complex gels were prepared by the addition of a hot (60 degrees C) aqueous niosome suspension (v/w) to the sol phase (o, an organic solution of the gelator); a vesicle-in-water-in-oil (v/w/o) emulsion was produced which cools to an opaque, semi-solid, thermoreversible v/w/o gel. Light microscopy of the organogel revealed that the microstructure consists of a tubular network of surfactant aggregates in the organic medium, the niosome suspension being dispersed in these surfactant tubules. Therefore, in such gels, the vaccine is thought to be entrapped in the niosomes, themselves located within the sorbitan monostearate tubular network in the organic medium. In vivo, a depot effect was observed following intramuscular administration of the gel containing the entrapped bovine serum albumin, cleared from the injection site over a period of days. The relatively short-lived nature of the depot was thought to arise due to interactions between the gel and the local interstitial fluid which results in gel disintegration in situ. Thus, the niosomes containing antigens are believed to be released from the organic gel. Immunogenicity studies showed that the v/w/o gel as well as one of the controls, the water-in-oil (w/o) gel, possess immunoadjuvant properties and enhance the primary and secondary antibody titres (of total IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b) to haemagglutinin antigen. As far as humoral immunity is concerned, the w/o gel showed stronger immunoadjuvant properties compared to the v/w/o gel, being effective at a lower antigen dose i.e 0.1 microg HA."

During the H1N1 2009 pandemic, pregnant women constituted one of the priority groups for vaccination in many countries, creating a need for close monitoring of the safety of the vaccine in pregnant women. We present findings from an analysis of a cohort of pregnant women (N=267) from a prospective, observational, post-authorization safety study of the AS03-adjuvanted split virion H1N1 (2009) pandemic vaccine. There were 265 known pregnancy outcomes with 261 live births, four spontaneous abortions with no congenital anomalies, and no stillbirths. There were six live births with congenital anomalies, of which one was diagnosed before vaccination. A total of 247 women (94.6%), of whom four had twin pregnancies, delivered at term, and 14 women (5.4%), of whom two had twin pregnancies, delivered preterm (between Weeks 24 and 36 of gestation), with three of them (1.1%) occurring before 32 weeks (very preterm). Twenty-one neonates (8.1%) had a low birth weight (<2.5 kg), of whom nine (3.5%) were term neonates. The prevalence of all outcomes was in line with the expected rates. The adverse events reported were consistent with the events anticipated to be reported by this study population. No adverse events of special interest were reported. The results of this analysis suggest that exposure to the AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 (2009) vaccine during pregnancy does not increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including spontaneous abortion, congenital anomalies, preterm delivery, low birth weight neonates, or maternal complications. Although limited in size, the fully prospective nature of the safety follow-up of these women vaccinated during pregnancy is unique and offers an important degree of reassurance for the use of the AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 (2009) vaccine in this high risk group for H1N1 infection."

Mycophenolate mofetil is an immunosuppressive drug and successful treatment of pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid has been reported with it, in combination with high dose prednisone, or as monotherapy. The present study describes our experience of the adjuvant use of mycophenolate mofetil in the management of 31 patients with pemphigus vulgaris as an initial treatment. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil combined with prednisolone in this cohort. We also assessed the relationship between the demographic indices/disease severity factors, and the failure of this treatment. In this study, mycophenolate mofetil was of definite benefit in 21 cases (67.7%). Generalized forms; patients with higher sum of the clinical scores at presentation; severe involvement of the groin; chest; face and limbs and those who had nail dystrophy also appeared to have poorer responses. When we excluded patients with generalized forms, only four patients were included in the failure group and the response rate reached 83.3%. It can be concluded that, except for generalized diseases, mycophenolate mofetil can be used safely and effectively in patients with pemphigus vulgaris as a first line, steroid sparing agent."

            "abstract": "Neoantigen-based immunotherapy is a promising treatment option for many types of cancer. However, its efficacy and abscopal effect are limited by impotent neoantigens, high treatment costs, and complications due to action of adjuvants. Here, the design and synthesis of nanovaccines are reported, based on self-adjuvanted, polymer nanoparticles with in vivo neoantigen-harvesting and molecular activating capabilities. These nanovaccines inhibit tumor growth significantly and prolong the survival of tumor-bearing mice in both colon carcinoma 26 (CT26) and B16-F10 tumor models. Mechanistic studies suggest that as-synthesized nanovaccines can promote dendritic cell maturation and accumulation expeditiously in lymph nodes, leading to the expansion of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Moreover, these nanovaccines elicit abscopal effects in CT26 and B16-F10 tumors without the need for adjuvants or immune checkpoint inhibitors. Combined with an anti-PD-L1 antibody, nanovaccines can evoke robust, long-term memory immune response, as evidenced by tumor growth inhibition and high survival rates (∼ 67%) over 90 days. These results highlight the potential of using self-adjuvanted nanovaccines as a simple, safe, and affordable strategy to boost neoantigen-based cancer immunotherapy."

Its goals were to identify the preferred primary 2-dose vaccination schedule in adults and to assess whether the vaccine met European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) licensure criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Healthy volunteers aged 18 to 60 years received 1 of 4 randomized schedules in which the 2 doses of vaccine were separated by a 1-, 2-, 3-, or 6-week interval. Three blood samples (~20 mL(-1)) were obtained from each subject: the first sample, immediately before administration of the first dose of vaccine; the second, immediately before administration of the second dose; and the third, 21 days after administration of the second dose. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI), microneutralization (MN), and single radial hemolysis (SRH) were assayed after each dose. Immunogenicity was assessed based on the CHMP licensure criteria for annual influenza vaccines (number of seroconversions or significant increase in HI titer >40%; mean geometric increase >2.5; and proportion of subjects achieving an HI titer ≥40 or SRH titer >25 mm(2) should be >70% [seroprotection]).

There were no serious adverse events related to vaccination. The most common adverse events reported within 7 days of the first and second doses of vaccine were mild to moderate injection-site pain (63%-73% and 34%-48%, respectively) and fatigue (25%-30% and 13%-24%).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Two 7.5-μg doses of MF59-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine given 2, 3, or 6 weeks apart afforded H5N1-specific immunity and met the CHMP licensure criterion for seroprotection in these healthy volunteers.

Patients with Williams or Cornelia de Lange syndrome frequently have abnormalities in neurodevelopment. This study has evaluated the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of a monovalent 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 MF59-adjuvanted vaccine in these subjects. Eighteen patients with Williams syndrome (ten males; mean age ± standard deviation [SD] 12.74 ± 4.49 years), 11 with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (six males; mean age 12.90 ± 4.85 years) and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (16 males; mean age 12.49 ± 4.55 years), never vaccinated against influenza, received a dose of the vaccine between 1 and 30 November 2009. Four weeks later, the seroconversion rates in the three groups were between 72% and 80% and the seroprotection rates were 100%, with a similar increase in antibody levels. Two months later, most of the subjects remained seroconverted with no statistically significant difference between the groups, and about 94% of the patients with Williams syndrome, all of those with Cornelia de Lange syndrome and all of the healthy controls were still seroprotected. Safety and tolerability were very good, with no difference between the groups. None of the patients developed documented influenza during the study period. These results show that the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of a single dose of the monovalent 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 MF59-adjuvanted vaccine in children and adolescents with Williams or Cornelia de Lange syndrome and moderate to severe mental disabilities is very good, and similar to that of healthy subjects."

Mounting evidence from clinical studies supports the concept of copathogenesis in which immune activation that is triggered by TB and mediated by cytokines stimulates viral replication and worsens HIV infection, especially when immune function is preserved.Methods. We performed a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in Kampala, Uganda, to determine whether immunoadjuvant prednisolone therapy in HIV-infected patients with TB who have CD4(+) T cell counts >/=200 cells/ mu L is safe and effective at increasing CD4(+) T cell counts.Results. Short-term prednisolone therapy reduced levels of immune activation and tended to produce higher CD4(+) T cell counts. Although prednisolone therapy was associated with a more rapid clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the sputum, it was also associated with a transient increase in HIV RNA levels, which receded when prednisolone therapy was discontinued. The intervention worsened underlying hypertension and caused fluid retention and hyperglycemia.Conclusion. The benefits of prednisolone therapy on immune activation and CD4(+) T cell counts do not outweigh the risks of adverse events in HIV-infected patients with TB and preserved immune function."

            "abstract": "Background Pembrolizumab has robust antitumor activity in advanced melanoma and has been approved for the treatment of melanoma in many countries. Adjuvant pembrolizumab was associated with longer recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with resected stage III melanoma. We herein report on the RFS outcomes of Chinese patients with resected stage III melanoma receiving adjuvant pembrolizumab in comparison to those receiving interferon α-2b (IFN-α-2b). Methods We retrospectively investigated the medical records of subjects with resected stage III melanoma with no in-transit metastases diagnosed who were treated at the Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and collected historical clinical data of patients receiving adjuvant IFN-α-2b therapy in our hospital. The RFS rates were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves, and the differences between the groups were tested using the log-rank test. Results A total of 29 patients receiving adjuvant pembrolizumab therapy and 27 patients receiving adjuvant IFN-α-2b therapy were enrolled. The median RFS was not reached (95% CI not estimable [NE]) in the pembrolizumab group and was 25 months in the IFN-α-2b group, and there was no significant difference in RFS between the pembrolizumab and IFN-α-2b groups (HR = 1.20, log-rank p = 0.75). There was no significant difference in RFS for acral melanoma between the pembrolizumab group and IFN-α-2b group (HR = 1.22, log-rank p = 0.79). For patients with IIIC or IIID melanoma, the RFS in the pembrolizumab group was also similar to that of the IFN-α-2b group (HR = 0.80, log-rank p = 0.47). The RFS for patients receiving pembrolizumab with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive tumors might tend to be longer than that for patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, but there was no significant difference between the groups (HR = 3.37, log-rank p = 0.17). High tumor mutational burden (TMB) did not reveal a trend to predict a longer RFS than low TMB in patients receiving pembrolizumab (HR = 1.63, log-rank p = 0.63). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 6 (22.22%) of 27 patients in the IFN-α-2b group. Discontinuations attributed to adverse events (AEs) occurred in 2 patients treated with IFN-α-2b. Immune-related adverse events were observed in 5 (17.24%) patients in the pembrolizumab group. In the pembrolizumab group, grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 2 (6.90%) patients, 1 of which required the discontinuation of a study drug and corticosteroid treatment. None of the patients discontinued treatment due to treatment-related or immune-mediated AEs. Conclusions Adjuvant pembrolizumab appeared to be as effective as IFN-α-2b in prolonging RFS in Chinese patients with resected stage III melanoma. Adjuvant pembrolizumab was associated with a lower rate of treatment-related AEs than IFN-α-2b. A prospective study is needed to confirm the clinical benefit of adjuvant pembrolizumab and determine dependable biomarkers."

In this work, we demonstrated that nasally administered L. rhamnosus CRL1505 is able to improve both the humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses induced by IFV infection or vaccination. Higher levels of IFV-specific IgA and IgG as well as IFN-γ were found in the serum and the respiratory tract of CRL1505-treated mice after IFV challenge. Lactobacilli treated mice also showed reduced concentrations of IL-17 and improved levels of IL-10 during IFV infection. The differential balance of inflammatory and regulatory cytokines induced by L. rhamnosus CRL1505 contributed to the protection against IFV by favoring an effective effector immune response without inducing inflammatory-mediated lung damage. The optimal immunomodulatory effect of the CRL1505 strain was achieved with viable bacteria. However, non-viable L. rhamnosus CRL1505 was also efficient in improving the adaptive immune responses generated by IFV challenges and therefore, emerged as an interesting alternative for vaccination of immunocompromised hosts. Similar to other immunomodulatory properties of lactobacilli, it was shown here that the adjuvant effect in the context of IFV vaccination was a strain dependent ability, since differences were found when L. rhamnosus CRL1505 and the immunomodulatory strain L. rhamnosus IBL027 were compared. This investigation represents a thorough exploration of the role of immunobiotic lactobacilli in improving humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses against IFV in the context of both infection and vaccination."

Vaccine immunologic adjuvants are compounds incorporated into vaccines to enhance immunogenicity. Adjuvants have recently been implicated in the new syndrome named ASIA autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants. The objective describes the frequencies of post-vaccination clinical syndrome induced by adjuvants. We performed a cross-sectional study; adverse event following immunization was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that follows immunization 54 days prior to the event. Data on vaccinations and other risk factors were obtained from daily epidemiologic surveillance. Descriptive statistics were done using means and standard deviation, and odds ratio adjusted for potential confounding variables was calculated with SPSS 17 software. Forty-three out of 120 patients with moderate or severe manifestations following immunization were hospitalized from 2008 to 2011. All patients fulfilled at least 2 major and 1 minor criteria suggested by Shoenfeld and Agmon-Levin for ASIA diagnosis. The most frequent clinical findings were pyrexia 68%, arthralgias 47%, cutaneous disorders 33%, muscle weakness 16% and myalgias 14%. Three patients had diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome, one patient had Adult-Still's disease 3 days after vaccination. A total of 76% of the events occurred in the first 3 days post-vaccination. Two patients with previous autoimmune disease showed severe adverse reactions with the reactivation of their illness. Minor local reactions were present in 49% of patients. Vaccines containing adjuvants may be associated with an increased risk of autoimmune/inflammatory adverse events following immunization."

There have been few reports on identification the early cellular effects of SIT.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Patients allergic to grass and/or mugwort pollen (n= 21) were treated with a 4-shot allergy vaccine (Pollinex Quattro) containing appropriate allergoids (grass/rye and/or mugwort) adsorbed to L-tyrosine plus a Th1 adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). Fourteen grass-allergic patients served as untreated controls. Using the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of these patients, an optimized lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) was employed to monitor the in vitro proliferative response of T-cells to an allergoid challenge (solubilised Pollinex Quattro) before the first and last injection and then 2 and 20 weeks after the final injection.

Twenty weeks after therapy, the SI decreased to baseline level. A vaccine challenge without MPL gave lower SI levels. A challenge of a clinically inappropriate tree allergoid vaccine gave no response, and a nontreated group also showed no response.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Following a short-course SIT adjuvated with MPL, challenges of allergoids were shown to activate allergen-specific T cells in vitro. There was an additional stimulating effect when the challenge was in combination with MPL. There were no non-specific effects of MPL, shown by the tree allergoid/MPL control. The timing of the response was closely correlated to the treatment course; reactivity fell two weeks after the final injection and 20 weeks later it was at baseline level. Thus an immunological response to SIT was detected after very few injections. This methodology could provide a basis for monitoring the immediate progress of allergy vaccinations."

The introduction of oil-adjuvanted vaccines into salmon aquaculture made large-scale production feasible by preventing infections. The vaccines that are given i.p. contain oil adjuvant such as mineral oil. However, in rodents, a single i.p. injection of adjuvant hydrocarbon oil induces lupus-like systemic autoimmune syndrome, characterized by autoantibodies, immune complex glomerulonephritis, and arthritis. In the present study, whether the farmed salmon that received oil-adjuvanted vaccine have autoimmune syndrome similar to adjuvant oil-injected rodents was examined. Sera and tissues were collected from vaccinated or unvaccinated Atlantic salmon (experimental, seven farms) and wild salmon. Autoantibodies (immunofluorescence, ELISA, and immunoprecipitation) and IgM levels (ELISA) in sera were measured. Kidneys and livers were examined for pathology. Autoantibodies were common in vaccinated fish vs unvaccinated controls and they reacted with salmon cells/Ags in addition to their reactivity with mammalian Ags. Diffuse nuclear/cytoplasmic staining was common in immunofluorescence but some had more specific patterns. Serum total IgM levels were also increased in vaccinated fish; however, the fold increase of autoantibodies was much more than that of total IgM. Sera from vaccinated fish immunoprecipitated ferritin and approximately 50% also reacted with other unique proteins. Thrombosis and granulomatous inflammation in liver, and immune-complex glomerulonephritis were common in vaccinated fish. Autoimmunity similar to the mouse model of adjuvant oil-induced lupus is common in vaccinated farmed Atlantic salmon.

Data were adjusted for potential confounders, including maternal age, body mass index, smoking, parity, civil status and comorbidities. Compared with infants of non-vaccinated women, infants of vaccinated women had similar adjusted ORs (95 % CI) for LBW (0.91; 0.79-1.04), preterm birth (0.99; 0.89-1.10), SGA (0.97; 0.90-1.05), low Apgar score (1.05, 0.84-1.31), and a marginal risk reduction for caesarean section (0.94, 0.89-0.99). H1N1 vaccination during pregnancy, using an AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, does not appear to adversely influence offspring risks of LBW, preterm birth, SGA, or low Apgar score.

            "abstract": "The absorption enhancing effects of chitosan and its derivatives have been intensively studied in recent years. It has been shown that these compounds are potent absorption enhancers. Chitosan is only soluble in acidic environments and is therefore incapable of enhancing absorption in the small intestine, the main absorption area in the gastrointestinal tract. Special emphasis has been placed on the absorption enhancing properties of N-trimethyl chitosan chloride (TMC), a partially quaternised derivative of chitosan, due to its solubility in neutral and basic environments. TMC is prepared by the reductive methylation of chitosan. The degree of quaternisation can be altered by increasing the number of reaction steps or by increasing the reaction time. Although the molecular weight of the polymer increases with addition of the methyl groups, a net decrease in the molecular weight is observed due to a decrease in the chain length of the polymer. TMC, like chitosan, possesses mucoadhesive properties. In vitro studies performed on Caco-2 cell monolayers showed a pronounced reduction in the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). TMC is also able to increase the permeation of hydrophilic compounds such as [14C]-mannitol and [14C] polyethylene glycol 4000 ([14C] PEG 4000, MW4000) across the cell monolayers. It was also shown that the degree of quaternisation of the polymer plays an important role on its absorption enhancing properties, especially in neutral environments where chitosan is ineffective as an absorption enhancer. The reduction in TEER is an indication of the opening of the tight junctions located between epithelial cells. Opening of the tight junctions will result in enhancement of absorption via the paracellular route. Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed transport of large hydrophilic compounds via the paracellular route as well as the mechanism of action of the polymer in which redistribution of the cytoskeletal F-actin is provoked, which leads to the opening of the tight junctions. Various in vivo studies in different animal models confirmed the ability of TMC to increase the absorption of the peptide drugs buserelin and octreotide after intraduodenal or -jejunal administration. However, TMC has always been administered as a solution in these studies. The impracticality of administering a solution, as well as the fact that most peptides are unstable in the presence of water, have led to the need for a solid oral dosage form with which TMC can be administered together with peptide drugs. Recent studies have focused on the development and in vivo evaluation of solid oral dosage forms."

The literature was searched using Medline (Ovid) and Pub-Med for original studies. Overall, the interpretation of data from randomised controlled trials conducted in well women is limited by inadequate sample size and short treatment durations with inconsistent results for the outcomes of libido and wellbeing. Studies of DHEA in women with adrenal insufficiency, although indicating potential improvements in mood and libido, are also limited by their short treatment phase durations. In addition safety data for DHEA therapy are lacking. The potential value of DHEA therapy for women still requires exploration in adequately powered well-designed randomised placebo-controlled trials. The studies of DHEA therapy in women with adrenal insufficiency suggest that this group is the most likely to derive health benefits from DHEA supplementation."

            "abstract": "An effective vaccine against Pseudomonas aeruginosa would be hugely beneficial to people who are susceptible to the serious infections it can cause. Vaccination against PcrV of the P. aeruginosa type III secretion system is a potential prophylactic strategy for improving the incidence and prognosis of P. aeruginosa pneumonia. Here, the effect of nasal PcrV adjuvanted with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG) was compared with a nasal PcrV/aluminum hydroxide gel (alum) vaccine. Seven groups of mice were vaccinated intranasally with one of the following: 1, PcrV-CpG; 2, PcrV-alum; 3, PcrV alone; 4, CpG alone; 5, alum alone; 6 and 7, saline control. Fifty days after the first immunization, anti-PcrV IgG, IgA and IgG isotype titers were measured; significant increases in these titers were detected only in the PcrV-CpG vaccinated mice. The vaccinated mice were then intratracheally infected with a lethal dose of P. aeruginosa and their body temperatures and survival monitored for 24 hr, edema, bacteria, myeloperoxidase activity and lung histology also being evaluated at 24 hr post-infection. It was found that 73% of the PcrV-CpG-vaccinated mice survived, whereas fewer than 30% of the mice vaccinated with PcrV-alum or adjuvant alone survived. Lung edema and other inflammation-related variables were less severe in the PcrV-CpG group. The significant increase in PcrV-specific IgA titers detected following PcrV-CpG vaccination is probably a component of the disease protection mechanism. Overall, our data show that intranasal PcrV-CpG vaccination has potential efficacy for clinical application against P. aeruginosa pneumonia."

Addition of the emulsion adjuvant to inactivated vaccine formulations provides for higher levels of antibody to the viral hemagglutinin (HA) in less responsive older adults, infants and children which, in the case of the pandemic vaccine, allowed only 3.75 µg of the HA to be immunogenic. The adjuvant also stimulates production of more broadly-reactive antibodies against strains that are mismatched to those in the vaccine, a potential advantage in the face of perennial influenza virus antigenic drift. In a field trial, ATIV was 89% efficacious in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza in 6-<72 month old children, 81% more efficacious than the unadjuvanted control split vaccine while, in older adults, ATIV reduced community-acquired pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations in adults >65 years old by 23% compared to unadjuvanted vaccine, in an observational study. The effectiveness of MF59 adjuvanted split pandemic H1N1 vaccine was 74% overall. Unadjuvanted pandemic vaccine was poorly immunogenic in HIV-infected persons, whereas their responses to MF59-adjuvanted vaccine were similar to those of healthy controls. Analyses of the clinical trials and pharmacovigilance databases and observational studies have shown that while MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccines are more locally reactogenic, they have not been associated with an increased risk for various adverse effects (AE) of special interest, including unsolicited neurological or autoimmune events."

            "abstract": "Fully effective vaccines for complex infections must elicit a diverse repertoire of antibodies (humoral immunity) and CD8+ T-cell responses (cellular immunity). Here, we present a synthetic glyco-adjuvant named p(Man-TLR7), which, when conjugated to antigens, elicits robust humoral and cellular immunity. p(Man-TLR7) is a random copolymer composed of monomers that either target dendritic cells (DCs) via mannose-binding receptors or activate DCs via Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7). Protein antigens are conjugated to p(Man-TLR7) via a self-immolative linkage that releases chemically unmodified antigen after endocytosis, thus amplifying antigen presentation to T cells. Studies with ovalbumin (OVA)-p(Man-TLR7) conjugates demonstrate that OVA-p(Man-TLR7) generates greater humoral and cellular immunity than OVA conjugated to polymers lacking either mannose targeting or TLR7 ligand. We show significant enhancement of Plasmodium falciparum-derived circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-specific T-cell responses, expansion in the breadth of the αCSP IgG response and increased inhibition of sporozoite invasion into hepatocytes with CSP-p(Man-TLR7) when compared with CSP formulated with MPLA/QS-21-loaded liposomes-the adjuvant used in the most clinically advanced malaria vaccine. We conclude that our antigen-p(Man-TLR7) platform offers a strategy to enhance the immunogenicity of protein subunit vaccines."

OM is also a polymicrobial disease, wherein an upper respiratory tract viral infection predisposes to ascension of NTHI from the nasopharynx, the site of colonization, to the normally sterile middle ear, resulting in disease. Using a clinically relevant viral-bacterial coinfection model of NTHI-induced OM, we performed transcutaneous immunization (TCI) via a band-aid delivery system to administer each of three promising NTHI vaccine candidates derived from bacterial adhesive proteins and biofilm mediators: recombinant soluble PilA (rsPilA), chimV4, and integration host factor. Each immunogen was admixed with the adjuvant LT(R192G/L211A), a double mutant of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin, and assessed for relative ability to prevent the onset of experimental OM. For each cohort, the presence of circulating immunogen-specific antibody-secreting cells and serum antibody was confirmed prior to intranasal NTHI challenge. After bacterial challenge, blinded video otoscopy and tympanometry revealed a significant reduction in the proportion of animals with signs of OM compared to levels in animals receiving adjuvant only, with an overall vaccine efficacy of 64 to 77%. These data are the first to demonstrate the efficacy afforded by TCI with a band-aid vaccine delivery system in a clinically relevant polymicrobial model of OM. The simplicity of TCI with a band-aid and the significant efficacy observed here hold great promise for reducing the global burden of OM in the pediatric population."

            "abstract": "Adjuvants help antigen to elicit an early, high and long-lasting immune response with less antigen, thus saving on vaccine production costs. In recent years, adjuvants received much attention because of the development of purified, subunit and synthetic vaccines which are poor immunogens and require adjuvants to evoke the immune response. With the use of adjuvants immune response can be selectively modulated to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or MHC class II and Th1 or Th2 type, which is very important for protection against diseases caused by intracellular pathogens such as viruses, parasites and bacteria (Mycobacterium). A number of problems are encountered in the development and use of adjuvants for human vaccines. The biggest issue with the use of adjuvants for human vaccines, particularly routine childhood vaccines, is the toxicity and adverse side-effects of most of the adjuvant formulations. At present the choice of adjuvants for human vaccination reflects a compromise between a requirement for adjuvanticity and an acceptable low level of side-effects. Other problems with the development of adjuvants include restricted adjuvanticity of certain formulations to a few antigens, use of aluminum adjuvants as reference adjuvant preparations under suboptimal conditions, non-availability of reliable animal models, use of non-standard assays and biological differences between animal models and humans leading to the failure of promising formulations to show adjuvanticity in clinical trials. The most common adjuvants for human use today are still aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate, although calcium phosphate and oil emulsions also have some use in human vaccinations. During the last 15 years much progress has been made on development, isolation and chemical synthesis of alternative adjuvants such as derivatives of muramyl dipeptide, monophosphoryl lipid A, liposomes, QS21, MF-59 and immunostimulating complexes (ISCOMS). Other areas in adjuvant research which have received much attention are the controlled release of vaccine antigens using biodegradable polymer microspheres and reciprocal enhanced immunogenicity of protein-polysaccharide conjugates. Biodegradable polymer microspheres are being evaluated for targeting antigens on mucosal surfaces and for controlled release of vaccines with an aim to reduce the number of doses required for primary immunization. Reciprocal enhanced immunogenicity of protein-polysaccharide conjugates will be useful for the development of combination vaccines."

The chemotherapy appears to be equally effective whether it is given daily for 5 days per month or on a weekly schedule. The overall effect is a relative reduction in tumour -recurrence of 25% or an absolute improvement in survival of 10%. However, doubt remains as to the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II colon cancer. To date, most of the randomized trials have demonstrated a relative reduction in tumour recurrence but have not shown any significant impact on survival. It seems likely that this inability to demonstrate a survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II disease relates to the fact that the trials have been underpowered to do so. Nevertheless, the absolute survival advantage is only about 2% and clinicians need to weigh this against the costs and toxicities of the treatment when managing these patients."

The seroconversion rate was 99% and the geometric mean titer (GMT) increased from 6 to 313. After the second dose the GMT increased further to 2008. The higher dose AS03(A)-adjuvanted 3.75microg HA vaccine did not further increase the immune response. Solicited symptoms reported within 7 days following vaccination were mainly mild to moderate. After the first dose of AS03(B)-adjuvanted vaccine (1.9microg HA) the most common solicited symptoms were pain at the injection site (35.6%) and irritability (31.7%). Fever (axillary >or=37.5 degrees C) was reported with an incidence of 20.2%. After the second dose reactogenicity tended to increase (injection site pain: 41.3%; irritability: 46.2%; fever >or=37.5 degrees C: 67.3%). Spontaneously reported adverse events with an intensity that prevented normal activities were documented for 2.9-6.7% of doses with only one event (vomiting) considered related to vaccination. There was one serious adverse event reported in the AS03(A)-adjuvanted 3.75microg HA vaccine group (traumatic brain injury) which was not considered as related to vaccination. In conclusion, these data suggest that a first dose of AS03(B)-adjuvanted A/H1N1/2009 vaccine containing 1.9microg HA in children 6-35 months old is highly immunogenic and that the overall reactogenicity profile is acceptable although reactions including fever tend to increase after a second dose."

Between 1989 and 1998, 42 patients with CIS of bladder underwent intravesical instillation of BCG. In the follow-up period from 6 to 116 months (mean: 37.3 months), the efficacy rate of intravesical BCG instillation for CIS of the bladder was 81.0%. Two patients died from the bladder cancer. The non-recurrence rate in patients with grade 2 carcinoma (19 cases) was not significantly different from that in those with grade 3 carcinoma (23 cases). However, the recurrence rate in patients with secondary CIS (15 cases) was significantly higher than in those with primary CIS (27 cases). The recurrence of CIS was observed in 7 of 42 cases. In 6 of 7 patients, CIS recurred within one year after treatment. Total cystectomy was performed in 10 of 42 patients, and pathological findings of muscle layer invasion were detected in 8 patients. Although side effects occurred in 33 patients (77.5%), no clinically significant side effects were observed. Our results suggest that intravesical BCG therapy may be useful for the treatment of CIS of the bladder."

Improving immunogenicity of parentral influenza vaccines has given rise to mucosal delivery routes. In this study, alginate nanoparticles (NPs) were efficiently synthetized by ionic gelation method and influenza virus and CpG ODN or Quillaja Saponin (QS) adjuvants were actively incorporated into alginate NPs. The prepared particles were evaluated for both humoral and cellular immune responses in rabbits' nostrils. The vaccination started with a prime dose and followed by three boosters (two intranasal (IN) on days 45 and 60 and the last dose, intramuscular (IM) on day 75). HAI titer had increased in all the samples; although, only in the group received WV + CPG suspension reached to the protective HAI titer. All the immunized rabbits elicited significantly high sIgA levels on day 75, compared to the negative and the IM groups. At the end of the study, IN administration of CpG ODN adjuvant with virus antigen induced higher IgG level than the groups vaccinated with alginate NPs with or without CpG ODN (P < 0.001). As for the cellular immunity, CpG ODN was capable of inducing significant levels of IL-4 and TNF-α, either through inoculation along with the virus suspension or as incorporated in alginate NPs. According to the obtained data, CpG ODN adjuvant showed higher immunogenic potential as part of a vaccine delivery system than QS. Moreover, applying alginate polymer as a nasal delivery system carrier was not deemed immunogenic against influenza whole virus."

Most of them were registered in the Norwegian Immunisation Registry (SYSVAK). Based on these registries, we aimed at estimating the vaccine effectiveness (VE) and describing vaccine failures during the pandemic in Norway, in order to evaluate the role of the vaccine as a preventive measure during the pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study, linking MSIS and SYSVAK with pandemic influenza vaccination as exposure and laboratory-confirmed pandemic influenza as outcome.

A single dose of both the formulations containing 15 μg of haemagglutinin protein showed minimal adverse reactions, the most common of which were pain at injection site (11.67%) and fever (10.00%). Both formulations produced 74-81% seroprotection (SRP: titre of ≥40), 67-70% seroconversion (SRC: four-fold increase in titres between days 0 and 21), and a four-fold increase in geometric mean titres (GMT). Aluminium hydroxide did not have a significant effect either on immunogenicity or on reactogenicity. Nevertheless, based on its recognized positive effects on the stability and immunogenicity of many vaccines, and its marginal benefit in both pre-clinical and Phase I studies of HNVAC, alum adjuvanted HNVAC was further tested in a staggered Phase II/III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre study of 200 and 195 subjects, respectively, parallelly assigned 4:1 to adjuvanted vaccine and placebo groups.

Several approaches have been developed to increase its absorption rate (e.g., nano crystals, liposomes, polymers, and micelles) and co-delivery of curcumin with adjuvants as well as different conjugation to enhance its bioavailability. In particular, micro-emulsions is an option for transdermal curcumin delivery, which has been reported to increase its absorption. Lipid-based nano-micelles is another approach to enhance curcumin absorption via gastrointestinal tract, while polymer-based nano-formulations (e.g., poly D, L-lactic-co-glycolic [PLGA]) allows the release of curcumin at a sustained level. This review summarizes the current data of the therapeutic potential of novel formulations of curcumin with particular emphasis on recent preclinical and clinical studies in the treatment of breast cancer."

In particular, hydroxychloroquine has been shown to have various beneficial effects on patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. There are several pathways targeted by the antimalarial drugs that are similar to the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and hence offering opportunities to develop novel therapies to treat the disease. Given the safety profile of hydroxychloroquine in pregnancy, there is merit in exploring the efficacy of this drug as an adjuvant therapy in women with early onset preeclampsia."

A total of 647 subjects were enrolled, 224 (35%) received a dTpa formulation with 0.5 mg aluminium, 209 (32%) a formulation with 0.3 mg aluminium and 214 (33%) a formulation with 0.133 mg aluminium. One month after boostering, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. All subjects were seropositive for anti-FHA and anti-PRN but 4% of the initially seronegatives in both reduced aluminium groups did not seroconvert for anti-PT. Booster responses did not differ significantly between groups for any antibody, but post booster vaccination anti-PT GMC's differed significantly between groups and decreased when vaccine aluminium content decreased. No clear difference between study groups in local or general side effects was demonstrated. The most frequently reported symptoms after vaccination were injection site pain (89.5-90.7%), fatigue (42.1-47.4%) and headache (41.1-45.1%).

            "abstract": "Present strategies for control of herpes genitalis recurrences require multiple daily doses of antiviral medication. Imiquimod, an immune response modifier, induces alpha interferon and interleukin-12; application in the presence of local herpes antigens during a recurrence may augment herpes simplex virus (HSV)-specific cell-mediated immunity. To test this theory, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of imiquimod 5% cream to assess safety and efficacy for decreasing recurrences. Patients with six or more recurrences of herpes genitalis per year applied study cream (imiquimod or placebo) to lesions one, two, or three times per week for 3 weeks for each recurrence during a 16-week treatment period. This was followed by a 16-week observation period. Of 124 patients randomized to the study, 103 completed the treatment period and 93 completed the observation period. The median times to first genital herpes recurrence were 53 days for those receiving placebo (n = 30) and 54, 60, and 64 days for those receiving imiquimod one time per week (n = 34), two times per week (n = 32), and three times per week (n = 28), respectively. The median annualized recurrence rates during the treatment period were 3.8, 4.9, 3.2, and 3.1, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in the time to first recurrence or in the annualized recurrence rate between the imiquimod and placebo groups in either the treatment or the observation period. A trend in increased rates of local adverse events at the application site and a delay in lesion healing with more frequent dosing suggested a pharmacologic effect. Although clinical efficacy has been observed for imiquimod in other conditions in which a TH1-type immune response may be beneficial, including other viral infections such as those caused by human papillomavirus, no apparent effect on the short-term natural history of herpes genitalis recurrences was observed."

Different interpretations of clinical trial results; the expected benefit of IVIg compared with that of alternate therapies; and issues about IVIg's safety, cost, and mechanisms of action have raised concern and uncertainty among practitioners. To clarify these areas, this paper examines the clinical, serologic, and immunologic data on more than 110 patients with various autoimmune neurologic diseases who received IVIg during the past 6 years at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. It also reviews work by other investigators on the efficacy, risks, benefits, and mechanisms of the action of IVIg in these diseases. In controlled clinical trials, IVIg has been effective in treating the Guillain-Barré syndrome, multifocal motor neuropathy, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and dermatomyositis. In other controlled or open-label trials and case reports, IVIg produced improvement in several patients with the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and myasthenia gravis but had a variable, mild, or unsubstantiated benefit in some patients with inclusion-body myositis, paraproteinemic IgM demyelinating polyneuropathy, certain intractable childhood epilepsies, polymyositis, multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and the stiff-man syndrome. The primary adverse reaction was headache; aseptic meningitis, skin reactions, thromboembolic events, and renal tubular necrosis occurred rarely. The most relevant immunomodulatory actions of IVIg, operating alone or in combination, are inhibition of complement deposition, neutralization of cytokines, modulation of Fc-receptor-mediated phagocytosis, and down-regulation of autoantibody production. Therapy with IVIg is effective for certain autoimmune neurologic diseases, but its spectrum of efficacy has not been fully established. Additional controlled clinical trials are needed."

Antibiotics were administered simultaneously with RU 41740 in one group and with a placebo in another group. The studies performed by Albarede and Ollivier showed that in acute respiratory infections RU 41740 was well tolerated and resulted in a more rapid improvement of severity score.

Vaccination represents the principle means of preventing influenza virus infection. Current vaccine approaches are hindered by the need to routinely reformulate vaccine compositions in an effort to account for the progressive antigenic changes that occur as influenza viruses circulate in the human population. In this study, we evaluated chimeric virus-like particle (cVLP) vaccines containing conserved elements of influenza proteins (HL5M2e (HA stem gene with 5M2e gene inserted) and NP), with or without glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored CCL28 (GPI-CCL28) and/or GM-CSF (GPI-GM-CSF) fusion proteins as molecular adjuvants. cVLPs elicited strong humoral and cellular immune responses against homologous and heterologous viruses, and improved survival following lethal challenge with both homologous and heterologous viruses. Inclusion of GPI-anchored adjuvants in cVLP vaccines augmented the generation of influenza-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice in comparison to the non-adjuvanted cVLP vaccines. VLPs containing GPI-anchored adjuvants reduced morbidity and improved survival to lethal challenge with homologous and heterologous influenza viruses. This work suggests that VLP vaccines incorporating conserved influenza virus proteins and GPI-anchored molecular adjuvants may serve as a platform for a broadly protective \"universal\" influenza vaccine."

Relapses have effects over several months. Health state valuations were higher than in the general population. Costs were higher in relapse than remission and for worse EDSS states. IFbeta-1b costs were larger than cost savings. The best cost-effectiveness estimate was pound28 700 per relapse avoided, which is pound809 900 per QALY gained; or pound328 300 per QALY gained allowing for effects of progression over 5 years. Estimates were robust to changes in assumptions.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The impact of multiple sclerosis on QoL is substantial. Future trials should base outcomes measurement on QoL and be better linked to natural history and cost data. IFbeta-1b produces important occasional short term QoL gains, but small gains in QALYs overall and large additional costs."

            "abstract": "The allergy vaccine Pollinex® Quattro Grass, developed for the prevention/relief of allergic symptoms caused by grass pollen in adults and children, contains extracts of 12 grass pollens and rye cereal (all chemically modified by glutaraldehyde), adsorbed onto L-tyrosine with addition of the immunostimulatory adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL®). This paper represents the first publication on genetic toxicology data for such a vaccine. An Ames test using five strains of Salmonella typhimurium at concentrations up to 2000 standardized units (SU) per plate in the absence (-) and presence (+) of metabolic activation (rat liver S9) showed negative results, as did treatment - S9 in the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA). However, a reproducible positive response was noted in the MLA + S9, which could not be attributed to extreme culture conditions, but may have been an artefact of the exogenous metabolizing system. Up to 60% false positive results are reported for the MLA with noncarcinogens. Hence, in vivo genotoxicity studies were conducted. These further assessments comprised a rat bone marrow micronucleus test following subcutaneous (s.c.) doses of 10 000, 20 000 or 40 000 SU kg⁻¹ per day for 2 days, and a comet assay in liver and kidney cells from rats treated with Pollinex® Quattro Grass at 20 000 or 40 000 SU kg⁻¹ per day s.c. for 2 days. Plasma analysis showed evidence of systemic antibodies to Pollinex® Quattro Grass immunogens, but the exposure levels could not be quantified. No evidence of genotoxicity was observed in either of the in vivo studies. Overall, the genotoxicity test results supported safe clinical use of Pollinex® Quattro Grass."

We have extended these observations to the first clinical evaluation of the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of CPG 7909 when added to a commercial HBV vaccine. In a randomized, double-blind phase I dose escalation study, healthy volunteers aged 18-35 years were vaccinated at 0, 4 and 24 weeks by intramuscular injection with Engerix-B (GlaxoSmithKline). The regular adult dose of 20 microg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) adsorbed to alum was administered mixed with saline (control) or with CPG 7909 at one of three doses (0.125, 0.5 or 1.0 mg). HBsAg-specific antibody responses (anti-HBs) appeared significantly sooner and were significantly higher at all timepoints up to and including 24 weeks in CPG 7909 recipients compared to control subjects (p< or = 0.001). Strikingly, most CpG 7909-vaccinated subjects developed protective levels of anti-HBs IgG within just two weeks of the priming vaccine dose. A trend towards higher rates of positive cytotoxic T cell lymphocyte responses was noted in the two higher dose groups of CPG 7909 compared to controls. The most frequently reported adverse events were injection site reactions, flu-like symptoms and headache. While these were more frequent in CPG 7909 groups than in the control group (p<0.0001), most were reported to be of mild to moderate intensity regardless of group. In summary, CPG 7909 as an adjuvant to Engerix-B was well-tolerated and enhanced vaccine immunogenicity. CPG 7909 may allow the development of a two-dose prophylactic HBV vaccine."

            "abstract": "Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a pain condition of the extremities that presents with pain and allodynia, decreased range of motion, swelling and skin changes. There are 2 forms of CRPS - Type I which does not have demonstrable nerve lesions and Type 2, which has evidence of obvious nerve damage. Management of refractory CRPS has been challenging. Some studies have revealed that the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) may be involved in the etiology of the pain in CRPS and perhaps that a NMDA receptor antagonist like ketamine is a potential treatment for CRPS. However, the side effect profile of ketamine is concerning, and limiting the adverse effects of the drug is beneficial. Dexmedetomidine is an alpha 2 agonist similar to clonidine with analgesic properties that can be used in combination with ketamine to provide additional analgesia in CRPS. This case describes the treatment of acute pain symptoms from Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome-Type 1 (CRPS-1) with sub-anesthetic intravenous infusion of ketamine with adjunct dexmedetomidine. A 47-year-old female patient presented with severe pain, burning and allodynia from CRPS-1 refractory to conventional therapy. She was then admitted to a monitored bed, received a sub-anesthetic intravenous infusion of ketamine with adjunct dexmedetomidine for 19 hours and subsequently discharged with complete resolution of her pain and associated symptoms. Here, the synergistic effect of the ketamine and dexmedetomidine together is shown to provide excellent symptom relief while decreasing the total ketamine administered. The combination minimized unwanted side effects and eliminated the need for intensive care unit admission secondary to anesthetic doses of ketamine."

            "abstract": "Ever decreasing efficiency of antibiotic treatment due to growing antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria is a critical issue in clinical practice. The two generally accepted major approaches to this problem are the search for new antibiotics and the development of antibiotic adjuvants to enhance the antimicrobial activity of known compounds. It was therefore the aim of the present study to test whether alkylresorcinols, a class of phenolic lipids, can be used as adjuvants to potentiate the effect of various classes of antibiotics. Alkylresorcinols were combined with 12 clinically used antibiotics. Growth-inhibiting activity against a broad range of pro- and eukaryotic microorganisms was determined. Test organisms did comprise 10 bacterial and 2 fungal collection strains, including E. coli and S. aureus, and clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae. The highest adjuvant activity was observed in the case of 4-hexylresorcinol (4-HR), a natural compound found in plants with antimicrobial activity. 50% of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4-HR caused an up to 50-fold decrease in the MIC of antibiotics of various classes. Application of 4-HR as an adjuvant revealed its efficiency against germination of bacterial dormant forms (spores) and prevented formation of antibiotic-tolerant persister cells. Using an in vivo mouse model of K. pneumoniae-induced sepsis, we could demonstrate that the combination of 4-HR and polymyxin was highly effective. 75% of animals were free of infection after treatment as compared to none of the animals receiving the antibiotic alone. We conclude that alkylresorcinols such as 4-HR can be used as an adjuvant to increase the efficiency of several known antibiotics. We suggest that by this approach the risk for development of genetically determined antibiotic resistance can be minimized due to the multimodal mode of action of 4-HR."

We evaluated the effectiveness of the pandemic H1N1 and seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines (TIV) used during the 2009 mass vaccination campaign in Manitoba (Canada) in preventing laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infections.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A population-based case-control study using data from Cadham Provincial Laboratory (CPL) and the Manitoba Immunization Monitoring System (MIMS). All Manitoba residents ≥6 months of age who had a respiratory specimen tested at CPL for H1N1 were included in the study. Cases were individuals who tested positive for pandemic H1N1 influenza A by reverse transcriptase-PCR (N=1435). Controls were individuals who tested negative for both influenza A and B (N=2309).

            "abstract": "Historically, vaccines developed toward influenza viruses of the B type using methodologies developed for influenza A viruses as a blueprint have not been equally efficacious or effective. Because most influenza research and public attention concerns influenza A viruses, these shortcomings have not been adequately addressed. In this manuscript, we utilized different influenza vaccine vehicles to compare immunogenicity and protection in mice and ferrets after vaccination against an influenza B virus. We report that plasmid DNA vaccines demonstrate low immunogenicity profiles and poor protection compared to either whole, inactivated influenza virus (IIV) or, live, attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccines. When mixed prime:boost regimens using LAIV and IIV were studied, we observed a boosting effect in mice after priming with LAIV that was not seen when IIV was used as the prime. In ferrets LAIV induced high antibody titers after a single dose and provided a boost in IIV-primed animals. Regimens including LAIV as a prime demonstrated enhanced protection, and adjuvantation was required for efficacy using the IIV preparation. Our results differ from generally accepted influenza A virus vaccine models, and argue that strategies for control of influenza B virus should be considered separately from those for influenza A virus."

In two observer-blind studies, a total of 261 healthy adults aged 18 to 60 years were randomized to receive either AS03(A)-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine containing 3.75 μg hemagglutinin (HA) or nonadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine containing 15 or 3.75 μg HA on days 0 and 21. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody and T-cell responses were analyzed up to day 42. A first dose of AS03(A)-adjuvanted vaccine (3.75 μg HA) or nonadjuvanted vaccine (15 μg HA) induced HI responses of similar magnitudes that exceeded licensure criteria (e.g., 94 to 100% with titers of ≥ 40). A lower response following 3.75 μg HA without adjuvant was observed (73% with titers of ≥ 40). Following a second dose, geometric mean HI titers at day 42 were higher for AS03(A)-adjuvanted vaccine (636 and 637) relative to nonadjuvanted vaccine (341 for 15 μg HA and 150 for 3.75 μg HA). Over the 42-day period, the increase in frequency of A/H1N1/2009-specific CD4⁺ T cells was significantly higher in the adjuvanted group than in the nonadjuvanted group. There was no evidence of correlation between baseline CD4⁺ T-cell frequencies and day 21 HI antibody titers, while there was some correlation (R = 0.35) between day 21 CD4⁺ T-cell frequencies and day 42 HI titers. AS03(A) adjuvant enhanced the humoral and CD4⁺ T-cell-mediated responses to A/H1N1/2009 vaccine. Baseline A/H1N1/2009-specific CD4⁺ T-cell frequencies did not predict post-dose 1 antibody responses, but there was some correlation between post-dose 1 CD4⁺ T-cell frequencies and post-dose 2 antibody responses."

Although different vaccines have been produced during past decades, there is still a huge demand for a safe influenza vaccine with the ability to induce mucosal immune responses and sufficient protection, especially in elderly patients. In this study, chitosan nanospheres were employed as the drug delivery system. Influenza virus, CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN) and Quillaja saponins (QS) were incorporated in this nanospheric system. Three doses of dry powder nanosphere vaccine were nasally administered to rabbits on days 0, 45 and 60, followed by a final booster injection on day 75. Both humoral and cellular immune responses were investigated. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer was elevated in all groups compared to the control group at the end of vaccination in rabbits receiving nanospheres loaded with virus and CpG, CH(WV+CpG) (P<0.001). Rabbit serum IgG raised significantly in all the vaccinated groups, with the highest responses in CH(WV+CpG) group. CH(WV+CpG) and CH(WV) induced significant sIgA titers (P<0.001). CpG adjuvant also showed a prominent role in the stimulation and secretion of of IL-2 and IFN-γ cytokines (3 and 3.5 fold increase, respectively). Finally, as CH(WV+CpG) depicted to be effective in induction of humoral and cellular immune responses after nasal administration, this nanoparticulate adjuvant could be identified as an efficient adjuvant/delivery system for mucosal immunization against influenza virus."

These formulations were evaluated for their ability to augment antigen-specific antibody responses when administered with a soluble protein antigen. All three adjuvants were shown to be nontoxic to mice and elicited antigen-specific antibody responses. Of the three formulations, RAM1 was found to induce the highest titers of antibody; these were substantially higher than those induced by reference control adjuvants.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Annual vaccination for healthcare workers and other high-risk groups is the mainstay of the public health strategy to combat influenza. Inactivated influenza vaccines confer protection by inducing neutralizing antibodies efficiently against homologous and closely matched virus strains. In the absence of neutralizing antibodies, cross-reactive T cells have been shown to limit disease severity. However, animal studies and a study in immunocompromised children suggested that repeated vaccination hampers CD8+ T cells. Yet the impact of repeated annual influenza vaccination on both cross-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells has not been explored, particularly in healthy adults.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We assembled a unique cohort of healthcare workers who received a single AS03-adjuvanted H1N1pdm09 vaccine in 2009 and subsequently either repeated annual vaccination or no further vaccination during 2010-2013. Blood samples were collected before the influenza season or vaccination to assess antibody and T-cell responses.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Antibody titers to H1N1pdm09 persisted above the protective level in both the repeated- and single-vaccination groups.

            "abstract": "Priming a population with a pre-pandemic vaccine is being considered to maximize the response upon subsequent vaccination with a true pandemic vaccine more closely matched to the causative pandemic strain. The present study explored this prime-boost concept by evaluating different primary schedules with the pre-pandemic A/Vietnam/1194/2004(NIBRG-14) vaccine, containing 3.75 microg of HA, followed by a 6-month booster with a vaccine formulated with 3.75 microg HA of either the same strain or with A/Indonesia/05/2005(IBCDC-RG2), a heterologous strain from a different clade. In this multicentre, open, randomized study (NCT00430521) we measured immune responses in four groups (N = 48-60) of adults aged 18-60 years who received a single booster administration of either A/Indonesia/05/2005 or A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine 6 months after a 1- or 2-dose (given 21 days apart) primary vaccination with A/Vietnam/1194/2004. All prime-boost schedules assessed induced early (7 days post-booster) humoral responses that met regulatory acceptance criteria. Two doses of A/Vietnam/1194/2004 given 6 months apart achieved equivalent homologous seroprotection after the second vaccination (89.6%), when compared to two doses given 21 days apart (92.7-93.2%). Remarkably, two doses of A/Vietnam/1194/2004 given 6 months apart induced a higher cross-reactive seroprotection against A/Indonesia/05/2005 (83.3%) when compared to two doses given 21 days apart (41.5-54.5%). A 6-month A/Indonesia/05/2005 booster dose after one primary dose of A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine induced 92.5% seroprotection against A/Indonesia/05/2005 and 98.1% against A/Vietnam/1194/2004. Since a single booster 6 months after one primary dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine induces strong and rapid seroprotective immune response against both homologous and heterologous H5N1 strains, these results might have important implications for public health strategy aiming to organize vaccination campaigns with pre-pandemic vaccines."

The first group received, by sublingual route, Ismigen, a new immunostimulating lysate (Polivalent Mechanical Bacterial Lysate, PMBL) obtained by mechanical lysis of 48 billion bacteria commonly responsible for upper respiratory tract infections; the second group received an oral immunostimulating lysate (CLBL) obtained by chemical lysis of 36 billion bacteria. A third group served as control and did not receive any immunostimulating treatment (Control NT). One tablet a day of PMBL was given to the first group for the first ten days during three consecutive months; the patients of the second group received one capsule a day of CLBL with the same treatment schedule. At the end of the treatment period the patients of the 3 groups were followed up for 3 months. The primary end point was the number of acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) that occurred during the three months of treatment and three months of follow-up. Secondary endpoints were: the number of patients free from disease, the duration of infectious episodes, the number of working days lost because of disease, the need for a concomitant antibiotic treatment, and the safety of the two treatments. During the treatment period the mean number (+/- SD) of URTIs per patient was 0.34 (0.48) in the PMBL group, 1.0 (0.83) and 1.23 (0.77) in the CLBL and Control NT groups, respectively.

In present study, we examined immune augmenting capacities of an emerging adjuvant, Naltrexone, against Fasciola hepatica infection in BALB/c mice. Seventy BALB/c mice were divided into five experimental groups (14 mice per group) including 1- control (received PBS), 2- vaccine (immunized with F. hepatica E/S antigens), 3- Alum-vaccine (immunized with Alum adjuvant and E/S antigens), 4- NLT-vaccine (immunized with NLT adjuvant and E/S antigens), and 5- Alum-NLT-vaccine (immunized with mixed Alum-NLT adjuvant and E/S antigens). Lymphocyte stimulation index was assessed by MTT assay. Production of IFN-γ, IL-4, IgG2a and IgG1 was assessed by ELISA method. Results showed that NLT, either alone or in combination with alum, can induce immune response toward production of IFN-γ and IgG2a as representatives of Th1 immune response. Also, using this adjuvant in immunization experiment was associated with significantly high proliferative response of splenocytes/lymphocytes. Utilization of mixed Alum-NLT adjuvant revealed the highest protection rate (73.8%) in challenge test of mice infected with F. hepatica. These findings suggest the potential role of NLT as an effective adjuvant in induction of protective cellular and Th1 immune responses against fasciolosis."

We compared the frequency of vaccinated children between influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 PCR positive cases and PCR negative controls in a retrospective case-control study. 95 cases and 177 controls were identified. About half of the children in both groups were between 6 months and 2 years of age. Only 1/95 (1%) cases had been vaccinated more than 14 days prior to admission, compared to 23/177 controls (13%), corresponding to a vaccine effectiveness, adjusted for co-morbid conditions, of 91% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30-99).

Here we applied systems approaches to investigate the innate and adaptive responses to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and MF59-adjuvanted TIV (ATIV) in 90 14- to 24-mo-old healthy children. MF59 enhanced the magnitude and kinetics of serum antibody titers following vaccination, and induced a greater frequency of vaccine specific, multicytokine-producing CD4(+) T cells. Compared with transcriptional responses to TIV vaccination previously reported in adults, responses to TIV in infants were markedly attenuated, limited to genes regulating antiviral and antigen presentation pathways, and observed only in a subset of vaccinees. In contrast, transcriptional responses to ATIV boost were more homogenous and robust. Interestingly, a day 1 gene signature characteristic of the innate response (antiviral IFN genes, dendritic cell, and monocyte responses) correlated with hemagglutination at day 28. These findings demonstrate that MF59 enhances the magnitude, kinetics, and consistency of the innate and adaptive response to vaccination with the seasonal influenza vaccine during early childhood, and identify potential molecular correlates of antibody responses."

The adjuvant drug OK-432 is known to have potent immunomodulation and therapeutic properties when applied in cancer treatment and may, thus, be important to trigger the appropriate immunological response in paediatric patients with a solid tumor that are vaccinated with a WT1 peptide.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      Paediatric patients with a solid tumor were vaccinated with a WT1 peptide and OK-432 once every 2 weeks, for a total of seven times.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 24 patients, 18 completed the scheduled vaccinations. Sixteen patients had local skin symptoms and/or fever. In 1 patient, anaphylactic symptoms emerged at the time of the final injection, but these quickly subsided after the treatment. WT1-specific immunological responses were observed in 4 patients (22.2%).

            "abstract": "The need to find a safe and highly effective cure for neoplastic disease remains a major challenge for modern pharmacology. This paper reviews the available literature on Ukrain (NSC631570), a novel semisynthetic drug obtained from Chelidonium majus L. alkaloids. Ukrain has been demonstrated to possess antineoplastic and immunomodulatory properties. Inhibition of the growth of cancer cell lines in vitro, tumor mass reductions in vivo, and partial and complete remissions in oncological patients, occur as a result of Ukrain application. The drug may interfere directly with the metabolism of cancer cells and it also improves the functioning of the host immune system. Diminished synthesis of DNA, RNA and proteins, the inhibition of cellular oxygen consumption, and the induction of programmed cell death in malignant cells have been described following Ukrain administration. The drug can also modify the immunological response via an increase in the number of total T-cells and a normalization of the T-helper/T-suppressor lymphocyte ratio. Ukrain therapy produces neither toxic consequences nor allergic reactions towards the drug. Several case reports and clinical trial data indicate that Ukrain may ameliorate effectively the progress of neoplastic disease and/or induce a total cure."

Clinical trial of the vaccines with different quantity of antigen (15, 30, and 45 mcg of H5N1 virus hemagglutinin) was carried out in Influenza Research Institute (St. Petersburg) and in Mechnikov Research Institute of Vaccines and Sera (Moscow). Analysis of results allowed to conclude that both vaccines were safe, well tolerated and characterized by low reactogenicity. Two-doses vaccination schedule was needed to meet required seroconversion and seroprotection rates (> or =1:40 in > or =70% of vaccinated volunteers). \"Orni-Flu\" vaccine containing 15 mcg of hemagglutinin and optimal quantity of aluminium hydroxide (0.5 mg) in one dose as well as IPSIV containing 45 mcg of hemagglutinin and 0.75 mg of polyoxydonium in one dose were most immunogenic after 2 doses - seroprotection rates in microneutralization assay were 72.2% and 77.0% respectively. Marked influence of aluminium hydroxide content on immunogenicity of the \"OrniFlu\" vaccine was confirmed in the study. Optimal quantity of adjuvant was 0.5 mg per dose. According to basic concept of vaccine development, preference is given to vaccine that under minimal quantity of antigen induces sufficient specific immune response and is safe in volunteers. \"OrniFlu\" vaccine containing 15 mcg of H5N1 virus hemagglutinin and optimal quantity of aluminium hydroxide (0.5 mg) corresponded to these requirements that allowed researchers to recommend it for clinical trials of 2nd phase."

Engagement by TLR8 agonists evokes a distinct cytokine profile which favors the development of type 1 helper T cells. Crystal structures of the ectodomain of hTLR8 cocrystallized with two regioisomers of a dual TLR7/8-agonistic N1-substituted imidazoquinolines showed subtle differences in their interactions in the binding site of hTLR8. We hypothesized that the potency of a previously reported best-in-class pure TLR8 agonist, 3-pentylquinoline-2-amine, could be further enhanced by \"designing in\" functional groups that would mimic key intermolecular interactions that we had observed in the crystal structures. We performed a focused exploration of decorating the quinoline core with alkylamino groups at all possible positions. These studies have led to the identification of a novel TLR8 agonist that was ∼ 20-fold more potent than the parent compound and displays prominent adjuvantic activity in a rabbit model of immunization."

            "abstract": "Current influenza vaccines elicit primarily antibody-based immunity. They require yearly revaccination and cannot be manufactured until the identification of the circulating viral strain(s). These issues remain to be addressed. Here we report a phase Ib trial of a vaccine candidate (FLU-v) eliciting cellular immunity. Thirty-two males seronegative for the challenge virus by hemagglutination inhibition assay participated in this single-center, randomized, double-blind study. Volunteers received one dose of either the adjuvant alone (placebo, n = 16) or FLU-v (500 μg) and the adjuvant (n = 16), both in saline. Twenty-one days later, FLU-v (n = 15) and placebo (n = 13) volunteers were challenged with influenza virus A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) and monitored for 7 days. Safety, tolerability, and cellular responses were assessed pre- and postvaccination. Virus shedding and clinical signs were assessed postchallenge. FLU-v was safe and well tolerated. No difference in the prevaccination FLU-v-specific gamma interferon (IFN-γ) response was seen between groups (average ± the standard error of the mean [SEM] for the placebo and FLU-v, respectively, 1.4-fold ± 0.2-fold and 1.6-fold ± 0.5-fold higher than the negative-control value). Nineteen days postvaccination, the FLU-v group, but not the placebo group, developed FLU-v-specific IFN-γ responses (8.2-fold ± 3.9-fold versus 1.3-fold ± 0.1-fold higher than the negative-control value [average ± SEM] for FLU-v versus the placebo [P = 0.0005]). FLU-v-specific cellular responses also correlated with reductions in both viral titers (P = 0.01) and symptom scores (P = 0.02) postchallenge. Increased cellular immunity specific to FLU-v correlates with reductions in both symptom scores and virus loads. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no.

The findings of these trials remain open to interpretation and have generated considerable controversy, as expected. A phase 3 trial [the International MS Secondary Progressive Avonex Controlled Trial (IMPACT)] became the fourth study of the beta interferons (interferon-beta-1a, in this case) to demonstrate a partial effect on disease activity in secondary progressive MS. Two trials demonstrated apparent partial efficacy for the anthrecenedione mitoxantrone in active and progressive MS.

            "abstract": "In most patients periodontitis is successfully treated by scaling and root planing, but some studies have shown that certain sites continue to show periodontal tissue destruction despite conventional periodontal therapy. To solve this problem, antibiotics may be administered as an adjuvant treatment. This includes azithromycin (AZM), which is effective against Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and has a long half-life in periodontal tissues. The purpose of the present study was to determine the efficacy of azithromycin as an adjuvant treatment for periodontitis through a review of the literature in Medline, Lilacs and Scielo, combining the keywords \"azithromycin\", \"periodontal treatment\" and \"periodontitis\" in both Portuguese and English languages. To be included, articles had to be clinical trials, randomized, controlled, double-blind or blind, and published between 2001 and 2011. 70 articles were found, of which 12 were selected based on title and abstract. Most studies used AZM as an adjuvant treatment for chronic periodontitis, usually in a single daily dose of 500 mg over three days, and indicated that AZM significantly reduced probing depth and increased periodontal attachment when compared to controls. Furthermore, a reduction in red and orange complex and an increase in bacteria associated with healthy periodontal conditions were observed in subjects treated with AZM. It may be concluded that the use of AZM as an adjuvant treatment for periodontitis improves clinical and microbiological parameters when compared to conventional treatment alone."

Frequency of adverse events was found to be similar between the two regimens: notably, no difference in the incidence of injection-site reactions, with a trend towards fewer influenza-like symptoms in the slow-titration group.

It is perceived that intranasal immunization, by offering a more convenient and less invasive vaccination modality, will boost vaccination rates against influenza, a disease that continues to inflict a significant annual health and economic burden worldwide. Intranasal immunization may also confer additional immunoprotective benefits by eliciting mucosal secretory antibodies at the site of entry of the virus, which are typically more broadly cross-reactive and cross-protective compared with those induced by systemic routes of vaccination. This property is highly desirable for confering improved protection against variant strains of influenza virus. Here we review the current status of intranasal proteosome-based influenza vaccines that comprise commercial detergent-split influenza antigens and proteosome adjuvants derived from purified bacterial outer membrane proteins. We demonstrate that these vaccines exhibit the desired advantages expected from immunization via the intranasal route. Furthermore, in clinical trials proteosome-based influenza vaccines were shown to be safe and protective in humans.

Within the framework of a prospective study on recurrence and progression of superficial urothelial carcinoma of the bladder after transurethral resection and BCG therapy, we retrospectively studied the clinical value of the observation that the use of bacteriostatic urethral lubricants reduces the viability and thus the efficacy of BCG.

            "abstract": "Vaccination is the most effective method for controlling the infectious diseases that threaten the poultry industry worldwide. The use of adjuvants or immunostimulants is often necessary to improve vaccine efficacy, particularly for vaccines based on recombinant protein or inactivated pathogens. The adjuvant effects of zymosan A on antigen-specific antibody production were investigated in chickens. First, the optimal adjuvant dose of zymosan A was determined. Chicks were immunized with dinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (DNP-KLH) at a dosage of 2 mg/kg body weight (BW) with or without zymosan A (at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg BW) co-administration at 4, 5 and 6 weeks of age. Different routes of immunization (oral, intranasal (i.n.), intraocular (i.o.), subcutaneous (s.c.), intramuscular (i.m.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) were tested. Anti-DNP IgY and IgA concentrations in serum samples from all chicks were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results revealed that co-administration of zymosan A with DNP-KLH significantly increased anti-DNP IgY concentrations in chicks immunized by the oral and s.c. routes of administration when compared with control groups. In addition, co-administration of zymosan A with DNP-KLH significantly increased anti-DNP IgA concentrations in chicks immunized by the oral, i.o. and s.c. routes compared with control groups. In conclusion, zymosan A is a useful immune-potentiator adjuvant in chickens, and its co-administration with vaccine antigens enhances humoral immune responses."

            "abstract": "In 2009, 943 children aged 6 months to 10 years were randomised to receive two doses of an oil-in water AS03B-adjuvanted split virion or a non-adjuvanted whole virion H1N1 (2009) vaccine. The large numbers allowed investigation of possible predictors of immune response and reactogenicity. We used regression analysis to examine the effect of variables including past receipt of seasonal vaccine, antipyretics post-vaccination, interval between doses and pre-existing antibodies to H1N1 (2009) on immunogenicity. We also examined the relationship between immunogenicity and reactogenicity and whether prior infection or underlying conditions affected reactogenicity. For both vaccines, haemagglutination-inhibition titres were 60% higher in children with fever ≥38 °C after vaccination and 29% lower in those previously given seasonal vaccine. Early use of antipyretics did not affect immunogenicity. Post-vaccination titres were higher with longer intervals between doses and in those with evidence of prior infection, but reactogenicity in the latter was unaffected. In the adjuvanted vaccine group, reactions were more common in children with atopy. Both vaccines were safe and immunogenic in those with prior infection. Reduction in the interval between doses for earlier protection would be at the cost of reduced immunogenicity. The effect of seasonal vaccine on immunogenicity merits further investigation."

The three vaccine formulations elicited equivalent functional antibody responses, as measured by growth inhibition assay (GIA), against homologous but not against heterologous (FVO) parasites as well as demonstrable interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responses. To assess efficacy, volunteers were challenged with P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes, and all became parasitemic, with no significant difference in the prepatent period by either light microscopy or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).

Current recommendations are to withdraw DMT prior to conception, leaving patients exposed to an uncertain period of untreated disease. The objective of this study is to report preliminary experience on glatiramer acetate (GA) exposure through conception, pregnancy and the post-partum period in a series of 13 patients with previously highly active relapsing-remitting MS. This is a prospective observational case series. Fourteen pregnancies of 13 women resulted in 13 live births (one twin pregnancy), nine exposed to GA throughout pregnancy. There were no birth defects and treatment was well tolerated. No relapses occurred during pregnancy in those continuing on treatment. In conclusion, our early experience suggests that when considering the risks and benefits of treatment withdrawal prior to pregnancy, it may be reasonable to continue GA in those patients with previously highly active disease. Consideration should also be given to the initiation of a birth register, similar to such initiatives in epilepsy, to generate more robust safety data in this controversial area."

            "abstract": "Because dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels decline dramatically with aging and low DHEA levels correlate with age-related diseases, it has been suggested that old age may represent a condition of DHEA deficiency. Accordingly, there have been some studies of the effects of restoring the DHEA levels of older individuals back to the normal range in the young. Emerging evidence from these studies shows that prasterone (DHEA replacement) may significantly enhance bone mineral density (BMD). In fact, the improvements of BMD in response to prasterone are accompanied not only by suppression of bone resorption but more importantly, stimulation of bone formation. Thus, prasterone appears to have additional anabolic effects on the skeleton, which represents an advantage over current pharmacologic agents that only inhibit bone loss. The osteogenic effects in elderly people are consistent with DHEA serving primarily as a precursor to active androgens and estrogens in local tissues such as bone. DHEA replacement may also increase levels of insulin-like growth factor-1, which may contribute to its anabolic effects. Although prasterone may be an effective therapy for improving BMD in both sexes, there appears to be gender differences in responses with more osteogenic effects in older women compared with older men. More studies, particularly randomized, placebo-controlled trials which include fractures as an outcome, are needed to fully define the potential utility of DHEA replacement as an anabolic intervention for age-related osteoporosis. These studies would also be important to gain information on risks associated with long-term DHEA replacement therapy. Further investigations are particularly warranted because prasterone is available over-the-counter in many countries and many older individuals are taking this hormone, without medical supervision, for its purported anti-aging properties."

Those with laboratory confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza or clinically diagnosed disease meriting antiviral treatment, allergy to egg or any other vaccine components, or coagulation defects, or who were severely immunocompromised or had recently received blood products were excluded. Children were grouped by age: 6 months-<3 years (younger group) and 3-<13 years (older group). Recruitment was by media advertising and direct mailing. Recruitment visits were attended by 949 participants, of whom 943 were enrolled and 937 included in the per protocol analysis.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nParticipants were randomised 1:1 to receive AS03(B) (tocopherol based oil in water emulsion) adjuvanted split virion vaccine derived from egg culture or non-adjuvanted whole virion vaccine derived from cell culture. Both were given as two doses 21 days apart. Reactogenicity data were collected for one week after immunisation by diary card. Serum samples were collected at baseline and after the second dose.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nPrimary reactogenicity end points were frequency and severity of fever, tenderness, swelling, and erythema after vaccination. Immunogenicity was measured by microneutralisation and haemagglutination inhibition assays. The primary immunogenicity objective was a comparison between vaccines of the percentage of participants showing seroconversion by the microneutralisation assay (fourfold rise to a titre of >or=1:40 from before vaccination to three weeks after the second dose).\n## RESULTS\nSeroconversion rates were higher after the adjuvanted split virion vaccine than after the whole virion vaccine, most notably in the youngest children (163 of 166 participants with paired serum samples (98.2%, 95% confidence interval 94.8% to 99.6%) v 157 of 196 (80.1%, 73.8% to 85.5%), P<0.001) in children under 3 years and 226 of 228 (99.1%, 96.9% to 99.9%) v 95.9%, 92.4% to 98.1%, P=0.03) in those over 3 years). The adjuvanted split virion vaccine was more reactogenic than the whole virion vaccine, with more frequent systemic reactions and severe local reactions in children aged over 5 years after dose one (13 (7.2%, 3.9% to 12%) v 2 (1.1%, 0.1% to 3.9%), P<0.001) and dose two (15 (8.5%, 4.8% to 13.7%) v 2 (1.1%, 0.1% to 4.1%), P<0.002) and after dose two in those under 5 years (15 (5.9%, 3.3% to 9.6%) v 0 (0.0%, 0% to 1.4%), P<0.001). Dose two of the adjuvanted split virion vaccine was more reactogenic than dose one, especially for fever >or=38 masculineC in those aged under 5 (24 (8.9%, 5.8% to 12.9%) v 57 (22.4%, 17.5% to 28.1%), P<0.001).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn this first direct comparison of an AS03(B) adjuvanted split virion versus whole virion non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine, the adjuvanted vaccine, while more reactogenic, was more immunogenic and, importantly, achieved high seroconversion rates in children aged less than 3 years.

            "abstract": "A promising alternative vaccine candidate to reduce the burden of pneumococcal diseases is the protein antigen PspA (Pneumococcal surface protein A). Since concomitant colonization with two or more pneumococcal strains is very common in children, we aimed to determine if immunization with PspA would be able to control co-colonization. We evaluated nasal immunization with recombinant PspA (rPspA) in a model of co-colonization with two strains expressing different PspAs. Mice were immunized intranasally with rPspAs from clades 1 to 4 (rPspA1, rPspA2, rPspA3 or rPspA4) using whole-cell pertussis vaccine (wP) as adjuvant. Mice were then challenged with a mixture of two serotype 6B isolates St491/00 (PspA1) and St472/96 (PspA4). Immunization with rPspA1+wP and rPspA4+wP reduced colonization with both strains and the mixture of rPspA1+rPspA4+wP induced greater reduction than a single antigen. Immunization rPspA1+rPspA4+wP also reduced colonization when challenge experiments were performed with a mixture of isolates of serotypes 6B (PspA3) and 23F (PspA2). Furthermore, none of the tested formulations led to a pronounced increase in colonization of one isolate over the other, showing that the vaccine strategy would not favor replacement. Interestingly, the adjuvant wP by itself already led to some reduction in pneumococcal colonization, indicating the induction of non-specific immune responses. Anti-rPspA IgG was observed in serum, nasal wash (NW) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples, whereas animals inoculated with formulations containing the adjuvant wP (with or without rPspA) showed higher levels of IL-6 and KC in NW and increase in tissue macrophages, B cells and CD4+T cells in BALF."

Therefore, the Prospective and Retrospective Observational Study of Avonex and Rebif (PROOF) was designed to provide long-term (up to 5 years) comparative data on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of these two agents. Patients with RRMS receiving treatment with either Avonex 30 microg intramuscularly once weekly or Rebif 44 microg subcutaneously three times weekly from 12 to 24 months are being enrolled and will continue their respective treatments for the 36-month duration of the study. The primary efficacy endpoint will be change in brain parenchymal fraction, which will be evaluated through magnetic resonance imaging scans by blinded radiologists. Secondary endpoints will include the following: relapse rates; intravenous steroid use; the proportion of patients with an increase of > or = 1 point on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and with an increase in EDSS score sustained for 6 months; mean change in EDSS score; cumulative number of new or enlarging T2 lesions; T2 and T1 lesion volumes; gadolinium-enhanced lesion number and volume; and safety and tolerability.

Whole blood was collected prior to immunization and at 8, 22, and 202 days post-vaccination, and subjects' serological responses were evaluated. Here, we reconstruct and examine the longitudinal, influenza-specific circulating B cell repertoire of one subject in that study. Genotypic analysis of 390 total subject-derived antibodies (Abs) revealed a total of 29 germline genes in use among immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions (IgHV), with the majority of those sequences isolated representing memory recall responses and two major lineages dominating the early response. In vitro phenotyping showed a diverse set of binding epitopes on the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), many of which are considered subdominant. Strong correlations were found between IgHV germline usage among non-related lineages and both binding epitope and neutralization breadth. Results here highlight the potential for Ab responses to be misdirected to egg-adaptive artifacts on CVVs while simultaneously stressing the ability to mount potent, broadly neutralizing responses to mostly novel antigens via recall of subdominant memory responses, as well as the need for evaluating alternative endpoint assays and anti-NA responses following clinical trials."

Vaccinees were asked to return questionnaires on local and systemic adverse events (AEs) after each of 3 consecutive vaccinations given at the office of their General Practitioner. Sex- and risk group-specific AE-frequencies were calculated. Generalized Linear Mixed Model with seasonal vaccination as reference was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for AEs of the 2 pandemic doses. 5553 questionnaires (3251 vaccinees) were returned. Vaccinees reported any local AE after seasonal vaccination and both pandemic doses in 34%, 23%, and 18%, respectively. These percentages were 29%, 25%, and 16% for any systemic AE. Men reported fewer local and systemic AEs then women (p<0.0001). The risk of local (OR range 0.34-0.63) and systemic (OR range 0.39-0.99) AEs (overall, stratified by risk group and by sex) was lower after both pandemic doses compared to seasonal vaccination. This decreased risk was more pronounced after the second pandemic dose than after the first.

Among different conjugation approaches, enzyme-mediated ligation is one of the few that provides an opportunity for the generation of homogeneous, molecularly defined products in which protein antigens are maintained with native structures, which is most critical to elicit protective immune responses upon vaccination. Four highly conserved protein antigens from Group A Streptococcus (GAS) have the potential to be safe and efficacious vaccine candidates. After a TLR2 agonist fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1 (FSL-1) was successfully attached onto each antigen using sortase A and techniques for their purification were developed, a combination vaccine containing interleukin 8 (IL-8) protease (Streptococcus pyogenes cell envelope proteinase [SpyCEP]), Group A Streptococcal C5a peptidase (SCPA), anchorless virulence factor arginine deiminase (ADI), and trigger factor (TF)-TLR2 conjugates was produced. This combination was assessed for immunity in mice and compared with mixtures of the four antigens with FSL-1 or alum. High titer antigen-specific IgG antibodies were detected from all vaccine groups, with antibodies elicited from FSL-1 conjugates around 10-fold higher compared to the FSL-1 mixture group. Furthermore, the FSL-1 conjugates afforded a more balanced TH1/TH2 immune response than the alum-adjuvanted group, suggesting that this combination vaccine represents a promising candidate for the prevention of GAS diseases. Thus, we established a conjugation platform that allows for the production of defined, site-specific antigen-adjuvant conjugates, which maintain the native three-dimensional structure of antigens and can be potentially applied to a variety of protein antigens."

            "abstract": "Invasive fungal infections have emerged as important causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. In response to this challenge, the field of antifungal chemotherapy has considerably expanded. Fluconazole and itraconazole, introduced in the late 1980s, were the first durably useful alternatives to amphotericin B deoxycholate. The clinical development of the lipid formulations of amphotericin B, and, more recently, that of novel echinocandin derivatives and improved antifungal triazoles each represent milestones in antifungal drug research that have further amplified our therapeutic options. Major progress has been made in harmonising disease definitions, in defining the paradigms of antifungal intervention, and in designing and implementing clinical trials. Standardised methods for in vitro susceptibility testing of yeasts and filamentous fungi have become available, and pharmacodynamic concepts have entered preclinical and clinical drug development. This article reviews the evolution of therapeutic options over the past decade, advances in chemoprevention and empirical antifungal therapy, progress in early diagnosis and pre-emptive therapy, the promise of the new echinocandins and second generation triazoles, as well as perspectives for combination therapies and adjuvant immunoreconstitution. Invasive fungal infections will remain a frequent and important complication of modern medicine; the current momentum in the field of laboratory and clinical antifungal drug research provides hope for substantial progress in prevention and management of these life-threatening infections in the near future."

            "abstract": "This study evaluated the long-term persistence of immune response and safety of two doses of an A/California/7/2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine adjuvanted with AS03 (an α-tocopherol oil-in-water emulsion-based Adjuvant System) in Japanese children (NCT01001169). Sixty healthy subjects aged 6 mo-17 y were enrolled (1:1) into two study groups to receive 21 d apart, two doses of 1.9 µg haemagglutinin [HA]+AS03B (5.93 mg α-tocopherol) vaccine (6 mo-9 y) and 3.75 µg HA+AS03A (11.86 mg α-tocopherol) vaccine (10-17 y), respectively. Immunogenicity data (by haemagglutination inhibition [HI] and microneutralisation assays) to six months after the first vaccine dose are reported here. It was observed that following Dose 2, the HI immune response against the vaccine homologous strain induced by the two different dosages of the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine met and exceeded the US and European regulatory guidance criteria for pandemic influenza vaccines (seroprotection rate[SPR]/seroconversion rate[SCR]: 100%/100%; geometric mean fold rise GMFR: 146.8/57.1). Further, the immune response persisted for at least six months after the first vaccine dose wherein these regulatory criteria were still met (SPR: 100%/100%; SCR: 96.4%/89.7%; GMFR: 25.3/23.5). The neutralising antibody response was comparable to the HI immune response at Day 42 (vaccine response rate [VRR]: 100%/100%) and at Day 182 (VRR: 96.4%/82.8%). Overall, both vaccine dosages had a clinically acceptable safety profile. Thus, two doses of a 1.9 µg or 3.75 µg HA AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza vaccine in children aged 6 mo-17 y induced strong immune responses against the vaccine homologous strain that persisted for at least six months after the first vaccine dose."

It is commonly used for treating cancer, cough and phlegm. To treat cancer, Chinese medicine practitioners often use raw PR; while to treat cough and phlegm, they usually use Pinelliae Rhizoma Praeparatum cum Zingibere et Alumine (PRZA, raw PR processed with ginger juice and alumen as adjuvant materials). Currently, the producing protocol of PRZA varies greatly among different places in China. This study aims to standardize the manufacturing procedure for PRZA. We also evaluated the impact of processing on the bioactivities and chemical profile of raw PR.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      We used the orthogonal design to optimize the manufacturing procedure of PRZA at bench scale, and validated the optimized procedure in pilot-scale production. The MTT assay was used to compare the cytotoxicities of raw PR and PRZA in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Animal models (ammonia liquor-induced cough model and phenol red secretion model) were used to compare the antitussive and expectorant effects of raw PR and PRZA, respectively. The chemical profiles of raw PR and PRZA samples were compared using a newly developed ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) method.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The standardized manufacturing procedure for PRZA is as follows: soak raw PR in water until the center of the cut surface is devoid of a dry core, after that, boil the herb in water (for each 100kg raw PR, 12.5kg alumen and 25L freshly squeezed ginger juice are added) for 6h, and then take out and dry them. The cytotoxicity of PRZA was less potent than that of raw PR. Intragastric administration of raw PR or PRZA demonstrated antitussive and expectorant effects in mice. These effects of PRZA were more potent than that of raw PR at the dose of 3g/kg. By comparing the chemical profiles, we found that six peaks were lower, while nine other peaks were higher in PRZA than in raw PR. Six compounds corresponding to six individual changed peaks were tentatively identified by matching with empirical molecular formulae and mass fragments.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The manufacturing procedure for PRZA was standardized. This protocol can be used for PRZA industrial production. The bioactivity assay results of raw PR and PRZA (produced using the standardized protocol) support the common practice for the clinical applications of these two decoction pieces. Moreover, raw PR and PRZA showed different chemical profiles. Further studies are warranted to establish the relationship between the alteration of chemical profiles and the changes of medicinal properties caused by processing."

The protection offered to children by conventional trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV) is suboptimal, due to poor immunogenicity and a higher exposure to infection and complications in this age group, particularly from influenza B strains. In this dose-ranging, factorial design trial, we report the safety and immunogenicity of different combinations of adjuvanted (ATIV) and non-adjuvanted trivalent (TIV) and quadrivalent (QIV) influenza vaccines in 480 healthy children 6 to <36 months of age. The results show that the second B strain added to TIV was immunogenic and did not affect immunogenicity of the other strains. The addition of the MF59(®) adjuvant promoted robust immune responses with notable elevations in antibodies observed even after one dose. A dose-response relationship was observed between the antibody response and MF59 adjuvant. No patterns in safety and tolerability emerged with different adjuvant and antigen doses nor with the addition of a second B strain.

It brings about reperfusion injury, which leads to dysfunction and/or loss of part of the myocardium. These groups of patients have a higher incidence of postoperative complications and mortality. One way of augmenting intraoperative myocardial protection is the phenomenon of myocardial conditioning, elicited with brief nonlethal episodes of ischaemia-reperfusion. In addition, drugs are being tested that mimic ischaemic conditioning. Such cardioprotective techniques are mainly focused on reperfusion injury, a complex response of the organism to the restoration of coronary blood flow in ischaemic tissue, which can lead to cell death. Extensive research over the last three decades has revealed the basic mechanisms of reperfusion injury and myocardial conditioning, suggesting its therapeutic potential. But despite the enormous efforts that have been expended in preclinical studies, almost all cardioprotective therapies have failed in the third phase of clinical trials. One reason is that evolutionary young cellular mechanisms of protection against oxygen handling are not very robust. Ischaemic conditioning, which is among these, is also limited by this. At present, the prevailing belief is that such options of treatment exist, but their full employment will not occur until subquestions and methodological issues with the transfer into clinical practice have been resolved."

Drugs like cimetidine and levamisole have been tried with varying success rates. Given the different target activities of immunomodulation by levamisole and cimetidine, we questioned whether the combination might be more effective and conducted this double-blind comparative trial of a combination of cimetidine and levamisole versus cimetidine alone. Forty-eight patients with multiple recalcitrant warts were assigned to two treatment groups (A and B) in double-blind fashion. Of the 48 patients, 22 in group A and 21 in group B were able to be evaluated. At the end of therapy, cure rates obtained were 45.5% (10/21) in cimetidine treated patients (group A) and 85.7% (18/21) in combination treated patients (group B). A statistically significant improvement was seen in patients treated with the combination of levamisole and cimetidine (P < 0.01). A similar statistically significant result was obtained on using intention to treat analysis (P < 0.02). The rate of regression was faster in group B (average regression period of 7 weeks compared with 10 weeks in group A).

            "abstract": "There is great interest in understanding the role of costimulatory molecules in immune activation. In both the influenza and HIV DNA immunization models, several groups have reported that coimmunization of mice with plasmids encoding immunogen and CD86, but not CD80, effectively boosts Ag-specific T cell activation. This difference in immune priming provided an opportunity to examine the functional importance of different regions of the B.7 molecules in immune activation. To examine this issue, we developed a series of chimeric CD80 and CD86 constructs as well as deletion mutants, and examined their immune activating potential in the DNA vaccine model. We demonstrate that the lack of an Ig constant-like region in the CD80 molecule is critically important to the enhanced immune activation observed. CD80 C-domain deletion mutants induce a highly inflammatory Ag-specific cellular response when administered as part of a plasmid vaccine. The data suggest that the constant-like domains, likely through intermolecular interactions, are critically important for immune regulation during costimulation and that engineered CD80/86 molecules represent more potent costimulatory molecules and may improve vaccine adjuvant efficacy."

In Cuba its incidence in 1980 reached 5.9 cases per 100,000 population; about 80% of cases were serogroup B, prompting health authorities to declare meningococcal disease the country's main public health problem. Several provinces reported over 120 cases per 100,000 children aged < 1 year, overwhelmingly serogroup B. At that time, no vaccines existed with proven efficacy against N. meningitidis serogroup B, nor was there a vaccine candidate that could be successful in the short term. By 1989, researchers in Havana had developed a Cuban meningococcal B and C vaccine, VA-MENGOC-BC, the world's first against serogroup B meningococcal disease. Its efficacy of 83% was demonstrated in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled field study. Vaccine production used vesicle or proteoliposome technology for the first time. The same year, the World Intellectual Property Organization awarded its gold medal to the main authors of the VA-MENGOC-BC patent. The vaccine was used in a mass vaccination campaign and later included in Cuba's National Immunization Program, with a cumulative impact on incidence of serogroup B meningococcal disease greater than 95% (93%-98%). Mass, systematic vaccination shifted the spectrum of meningococcal strains in healthy asymptomatic carriers and strains circulating among population groups toward nonvirulent phenotypes. The disease ceased to be a public health problem in the country. VA-MENGOC-BC is the most widely applied vaccine against serogroup B meningococcal disease in the world. Over 60 million doses have been administered in Latin America. In several countries where it has been applied, in which strains other than the vaccine-targeted strains circulate, VA-MENGOC-BC has demonstrated effectiveness against all (55%-98% in children aged < = 4 years and 73%-100% in children aged > 4 years). The vaccine and its proteoliposome technology have had an impact and continue to have potential, not only for meningococcal disease, but also for development of other vaccines and adjuvants.KEYWORDS Neisseria meningitidis, meningococcal disease, meningo-coccal vaccine, biotechnology, pharmaceutical industry, bacterial menin-gitis, meningococcal meningitis, immunization, vaccination, Cuba."

            "abstract": "The efficiency of the vaccination against influenza resp. its assessment depends on methodological factors, on the vaccine in use and on the epidemiological situation. According to serological tests protection rates (p) may be found of 0,8-0,9; a combined clinical and serological evaluation leads to a value of p=0,7 and after clinical estimation p=0,5. For statistical evaluation it is important to know whether the groups of persons to be compared were randomized or selected. Vaccination groups consisting of volunteers were selected in as much as the vaccines apparently exhibited a higher premorbidity than the control groups. Further on the protection rate is influenced by the number of vaccinations performed. Another very important factor is the composition of the vaccine in use, which should be in accordance with the recommendations of the WHO. Concentration of antigen and addition of adiuvant also influences the efficiency of inactivated vaccines. The antigenic composition is also relevant in live attenuated vaccines. Epidemiological factors are of importance in as much as the efficiency of the vaccination rises with the morbidity of the population. However, even in interepidemic periods the vaccination offers a certain degree of clinically observable protection (0,3). The indication for vaccination against influenza is influenced by age. In older persons the vaccination depresses morbidity and mortality rates, in middle aged working people lower morbidity and a drop in days of absence resulted as consequence of a vaccination campaign, whereas in children shedding of virus is prevented by the vaccination."

The H1N1 pandemic highlighted challenges in public health decision-making during a public health emergency. Understanding this process to identify barriers and modifiable influences is important to improve the response to future emergencies. The purpose of this study is to examine the H1N1 pandemic decision-making process in Canada with an emphasis on the use of evidence for public health decisions. Using semi-structured key informant interviews conducted after the pandemic (July-November 2010) and a document analysis, we examined four highly debated pandemic policies: use of adjuvanted vaccine by pregnant women, vaccine priority groups and sequencing, school closures and personal protective equipment. Data were analysed for thematic content guided by Lomas' policy decision-making framework as well as indicative coding using iterative methods. We interviewed 40 public health officials and scientific advisors across Canada and reviewed 76 pandemic policy documents. Our analysis revealed that pandemic pre-planning resulted in strong beliefs, which defined the decision-making process. Existing ideological perspectives of evidence strongly influenced how information was used such that the same evidentiary sources were interpreted differently according to the ideological perspective. Participants recognized that current models for public health decision-making failed to make explicit the roles of scientific evidence in relation to contextual factors. Conflict avoidance theory explained policy decisions that went against the prevailing evidence. Clarification of roles and responsibilities within the public health system would reduce duplication and maintain credibility. A more transparent and iterative approach to incorporating evidence into public health decision-making that reflects the realities of the external pressures present during a public health emergency is needed."

            "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to prepare solid Quil A-cholesterol-phospholipid formulations (as powder mixtures or compressed to pellets) by physical mixing or by freeze-drying of aqueous dispersions of these components in ratios that allow spontaneous formation of ISCOMs and other colloidal structures upon hydration. The effect of addition of excess cholesterol to the lipid mixtures on the release of a model antigen (PE-FITC-OVA) from the pellets was also investigated. Physical properties were evaluated by X-ray powder diffractometry (XPRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and polarized light microscopy (PLM). Characterization of aqueous colloidal dispersions was performed by negative staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Physically mixed powders (with or without PE-FITC-OVA) and pellets prepared from the same powders did not spontaneously form ISCOM matrices and related colloidal structures such as worm-like micelles, ring-like micelles, lipidic/layered structures and lamellae (hexagonal array of ring-like micelles) upon hydration as expected from the pseudo-ternary diagram for aqueous mixtures of Quil A, cholesterol and phospholipid. In contrast, spontaneous formation of the expected colloids was demonstrated for the freeze-dried lipid mixtures. Pellets prepared by compression of freeze-dried powders released PE-FITC-OVA slower than those prepared from physically mixed powders. TEM investigations revealed that the antigen was released in the form of colloidal particles (ISCOMs) from pellets prepared by compression of freeze-dried powders. The addition of excess cholesterol slowed down the release of antigen. The findings obtained in this study are important for the formulation of solid Quil A-containing lipid articles as controlled particulate adjuvant containing antigen delivery systems."

The purpose was to determine if mothers immunised against A/H1N1v during the pandemic vaccination period transferred that immunity to their child in utero.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Three sites in the UK [Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham; City Hospital, Nottingham (both forming University Hospitals Nottingham), and Leicester Royal Infirmary (part of University Hospitals Leicester)].\n    \n\n\n          Participants:\n        \n      \n      All pregnant women in the second and third trimester presenting at the NHS hospitals above to deliver were eligible to participate in the study. Women were included regardless of age, social class, ethnicity, gravida and parity status, past and current medical history (including current medications), ethnicity, mode of delivery and pregnancy outcome (live/stillbirth).\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      At enrolment, participants provided written consent and completed a questionnaire. At parturition, venous cord blood was obtained for serological antibody analysis.

Regarding a suitable threshold for the determination of a serological response consistent with clinical protection, this issue is somewhat complex for pandemic influenza. The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) judges that a haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre of 1 : 40 is an acceptable threshold. However, this level was set in the context of licensing plain trivalent seasonal vaccine, where a titre of 1 : 40 is but one of several related immunogenicity criteria, and supported by paired sera capable of demonstrating a fourfold rise in antibody titre in response to vaccination. The current study mainly investigated the effects of an AS03-adjuvanted monovalent vaccine, and it was not possible to obtain paired sera where the initial sample was taken before vaccination (in vaccinated subjects). Of possibly greater relevance is the fact that it has been established from the study of early outbreaks of pandemic influenza in secondary schools in the UK (HPA, unpublished observations) that an HI antibody titre of 1 : 32 seems to be the threshold for a humoral response to 'wild-type' A/H1N1v infection. On that basis, a threshold of 1 : 32 is at least as appropriate as one of 1 : 40, especially in unvaccinated individuals. Given the difficulties that would accrue by applying thresholds of 1 : 32 in unvaccinated patients and 1 : 40 in vaccinated patients, we have therefore applied a threshold of 1 : 32 and 1 : 40, to increase the robustness of our findings. Differences arising are described. A microneutralisation (MN) titre of 1 : 40 may be also used, although it is not part of the CHMP criteria for vaccine licensure. Nonetheless, we utilised this analysis as a secondary end point, based on a conservative threshold of 1 : 60.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Reverse cumulative distribution percentage curves for haemagglutinin dilution and MN titres demonstrate background immunity in babies of unvaccinated mothers of 25%-30%. Humoral immunity in babies of vaccinated mothers was present in 80% of the group. The difference in positive immunity between the babies of unvaccinated and vaccinated mothers was statistically significant (chi-squared test, p < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our findings reveal a highly significant difference in HI titres between babies born to mothers vaccinated with pandemic-specific vaccine against A/H1N1v during the 2009-10 pandemic period. The subjects recruited were comparable from a baseline perspective and thus do not represent different groups that otherwise could have introduced bias into the study. Continued circulation of 2009 A/H1N1-like viruses is uncertain, but is possible as seasonal influenza in years to come. It is possible that future seasonal waves may display increased virulence. Given the adverse outcomes experienced for a small proportion of pregnant women during the influenza pandemic of 2009-10, this study provides useful evidence to support vaccination in pregnancy to protect both the mother and baby.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme."

There is already considerable heterogeneity in the types of vaccine available and of study performed around the world. A systematic review and meta-analysis is needed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccines. We searched Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and other online databases up to 1st October 2010 for studies in any language comparing different pandemic H1N1 vaccines, with or without placebo, in healthy populations aged at least 6 months. The primary outcome was seroprotection according to haemagglutination inhibition (HI). Safety outcomes were adverse events. Meta-analysis was performed for the primary outcome. We identified 18 articles, 1 only on safety and 17 on immunogenicity, although 1 was a duplicate. We included 16 articles in the meta-analysis, covering 17,921 subjects. Adequate seroprotection (≥70%) was almost invariably achieved in all age groups, and even after one dose and at low antigen content (except in children under 3 years receiving one dose of non-adjuvanted vaccine). Non-adjuvanted vaccine from international companies and adjuvanted vaccines containing oil in water emulsion (e.g. AS03, MF59), rather than aluminium, performed better. Two serious vaccination-associated adverse events were reported, both of which resolved fully. No death or case of Guillain-Barré syndrome was reported. The pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 vaccine, with or without adjuvant, appears generally to be seroprotective after just one dose and safe among healthy populations aged ≥36 months; very young children (6-35 months) may need to receive two doses of non-adjuvanted vaccine or one dose of AS03(A/B)-adjuvanted product to achieve seroprotection."

Sometimes the course is more progressive. Since the disease can be disabling, several treatments have been developed that reduce the risk of relapse and progression of sustained disability. Although earlier treatment is encouraged, currently approved disease modifying therapies for MS are only partially effective, administered parenterally and associated with significant side effects and potential toxicities.

Seroconversion and seroprotection rates against the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus were 100% two months after vaccine administration in both groups, regardless of the sequence of administration. Geometric mean titres against pandemic and seasonal antigens were significantly higher when the seasonal and pandemic vaccines were administered simultaneously than when the seasonal vaccine was administered alone. Local and systemic reactions were mild and not increased by simultaneous administration. In conclusion, the 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 MF59-adjuvanted vaccine is as immunogenic, safe and well tolerated in HIV-infected children and adolescents as in healthy controls. Its simultaneous administration with virosomal-adjuvanted seasonal antigens seems to increase immune response to both pandemic and seasonal viruses with the same safety profile as that of the pandemic vaccine alone. However, because this finding cannot be clearly explained by an immunological viewpoint, further studies are needed to clarify the reasons of its occurrence."

The primary endpoint evaluated the humoral immune response in terms of H5N1 haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres against the vaccine strain (Clade 2.1) 21 days after the second dose. Ninety five percent confidence intervals for geometric mean titres, seroprotection, seroconversion and seropositivity rates were calculated. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included the assessment of the humoral response in terms of neutralising antibody titres, the response against additional H5N1 strains (Clade 1 and Clade 2.2), as well as the evaluation of safety and reactogenicity.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Robust immune responses were elicited after two doses of the prepandemic influenza vaccine adjuvanted with AS03A.

However, the expected outcomes and the selection criteria are undetermined and controversial. A few articles have mentioned the long-term result of Sodium Hyaluronate in failed conservative treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      Determine the clinical outcomes of treatment with three intra-articular Sodium Hyaluronate injections (500-730 kilodalton (KDA), Hyalgan) in knee-osteoarthritis patients who failed conservative treat-ment.\n    \n\n\n          Material and method:\n        \n      \n      This was an uncontrolled, retrospective-cohort study with at least a 24-month followup period. The outcomes of the treatment were evaluated by questionnaires and telephone calls. The primary efficacy parameter was the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score and the secondary efficacy parameter was delay or cancellation of any surgical treatments during the followup period. Patients who had undergone surgical treatments were placed in the non-response group. The response group has repeated treatment every year.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One hundred and eighty-three patients (208 knees) treated with intra-articular Sodium Hyaluronate were classified into three groups according to radiographic assessment.

In severe osteoarthritis patients (Ahlback grade 3, 4, 5), this treatment was of less benefit if those patients were young, active, and expected independent ambulation. Surgical treatment may be a procedure of choice to meet patient expectation in improving function and ambulatory status. On the other hand, if patients were old and inactive with household ambulation, using intra-articular Sodium Hyaluronate was beneficial in improving pain, stiffness, and function but not ambulation level with 86.56% of excellent or good in overall satisfaction level. Thus, the radiographic evaluation, age, ambulatory status, and patient expectation may be the key factors to determine successful outcomes."

Phase I of this 2-phase study was a randomized, single-dose, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in which subjects were randomly administered either 10 mg or 20 mg of dronabinol or identical placebo capsules over the course of three, 8-hour visits. Baseline self-report measures, hourly ratings of pain intensity, pain relief, pain bothersomeness, treatment satisfaction, mood, side effects, and blood serum levels were obtained. Phase II was an extended open-label titrated trial of dronabinol as add-on medication to patients on stable doses of opioids. Results of the Phase I study showed that patients who received dronabinol experienced decreased pain intensity and increased satisfaction compared with placebo. No differences in benefit were found between the 20 mg and 10 mg doses. In the Phase II trial, titrated dronabinol contributed to significant relief of pain, reduced pain bothersomeness, and increased satisfaction compared with baseline.

            "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for developing severe influenza virus infection, making vaccination of utmost importance for this high-risk population. However, vaccinated obese animals and adults have decreased neutralizing antibody responses. In these studies, we tested the hypothesis that the addition of either alum or a squalene-based adjuvant (AS03) to an influenza vaccine would improve neutralizing antibody responses and protect obese mice from challenge. Our studies demonstrate that adjuvanted vaccine does increase both neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibody levels compared to vaccine alone. Although obese mice mount significantly decreased virus-specific antibody responses, both the breadth and the magnitude of the responses against hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are decreased compared to the responses in lean mice. Importantly, even with a greater than fourfold increase in neutralizing antibody levels, obese mice are not protected against influenza virus challenge and viral loads remain elevated in the respiratory tract. Increasing the antigen dose affords no added protection, and a decreasing viral dose did not fully mitigate the increased mortality seen in obese mice. Overall, these studies highlight that, while the use of an adjuvant does improve seroconversion, vaccination does not fully protect obese mice from influenza virus challenge, possibly due to the increased sensitivity of obese animals to infection. Given the continued increase in the global obesity epidemic, our findings have important implications for public health.\n    \n\n\n          Importance:\n        \n      \n      Vaccination is the most effective strategy for preventing influenza virus infection and is a key component for pandemic preparedness. However, vaccines may fail to provide optimal protection in high-risk groups, including overweight and obese individuals. Given the worldwide obesity epidemic, it is imperative that we understand and improve vaccine efficacy. No work to date has investigated whether adjuvants increase the protective capacity of influenza vaccines in the obese host. In these studies, we show that adjuvants increased the neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibody responses during vaccination of lean and obese mice to levels considered \"protective,\" and yet, obese mice still succumbed to infection. This vulnerability is likely due to a combination of factors, including the increased susceptibility of obese animals to develop severe and even lethal disease when infected with very low viral titers. Our studies highlight the critical public health need to translate these findings and better understand vaccination in this increasing population."

Toxicities attributed to 14.G2a included pain, allergic or anaphylactic reactions, and rash. Human antimouse antibodies were demonstrated in 9 of 21 evaluated patients. One patient with neuroblastoma had a partial response, and one patient with osteosarcoma had a complete response.

            "abstract": "Although current influenza vaccines have been shown to reduce influenza-related morbidity and mortality, there is a desire to develop more efficacious products. Vaccines which can induce CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses in addition to strong antibody responses may be more effective in preventing disease since it has been demonstrated that CTL contribute to protective immunity, even against drift variants of influenza A viruses. The immunogenicity of two types of experimental influenza vaccines, which were based on immune stimulating complexes (ISCOM), were evaluated and compared with a conventional non-adjuvanted inactivated split virion vaccine, after immunization of human volunteers. In this randomized, double blind study, it was shown that the ISCOM vaccines altered the kinetics of the serum antibody response, resulting in more rapid titer rises against the vaccine strains. This accelerated antibody response coincided with enhanced in vitro proliferative T cell responses, which were observed shortly after vaccination. In addition, CTL responses were observed in a higher proportion of the vaccinees receiving an ISCOM vaccine, than in vaccinees receiving the conventional influenza vaccine."

We performed a meta-analysis of studies designed as part of the clinical development program for this vaccine, to examine the relative risk of abortion (spontaneous or elective) associated with unintended vaccination exposure during pregnancy. Nineteen studies, completed before September 2010, were eligible; 5 matched the inclusion criteria for this analysis (presence of a control arm and at least one adverse pregnancy outcome reported). All vaccinated women (N=19,727) were included, of whom 660 reported a pregnancy during the study period. Overall, 13.3% of pregnancies in the HSV vaccine group and 11.0% in the control group resulted in spontaneous abortion; 24.2% and 20.0% resulted in elective abortion. Among 180 women with a first pregnancy conceived in the vaccination exposure window, 16.7% (HSV vaccine) and 9.5% (control) had a spontaneous abortion and 38.5% and 33.3%, elective abortion. The relative risk for spontaneous abortion associated with vaccine exposure during the risk period for abortion in the course of pregnancy was 1.7 (95% CI: 0.7-4.6). For all women receiving HSV vaccine, this relative risk was 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.1). The corresponding relative risks for elective abortion were 1.2 (95% CI: 0.7-2.0) and 1.3 (95% CI: 0.9-1.8). There was no apparent relationship to dosing and no difference between groups in gestational age at the time of spontaneous or elective abortion. In conclusion there is no statistical evidence that the investigational HSV vaccine increased the risk of spontaneous or elective abortion."

Standard inactivated whole-virion influenza vaccine was introduced in a dose of 0.5 ml subcutaneously in a single injection or intranasally in two administrations. In control groups placebo was used. The frequency of seroconversions to vaccine strains of influenza viruses was significantly less in elderly people than in young people following both subcutaneous and intranasal immunization (on the average, by 15-20%). In young people the prophylactic effectiveness of the vaccine introduced intranasally was the same as after subcutaneous immunization with the effectiveness index (EI) being equal to 2.1-2.8. In elderly people the effectiveness of the vaccine after subcutaneous immunization was the same as in young people (EI = 1.7-2.7), but insufficient after intranasal immunization (EI < or = 1.6).

            "abstract": "Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Recent reports indicate that immunizations may increase IIeplication in infected individuals. Generally, vaccination against influenza is well tolerated in both children and adult individuals with HNIVand does not induce significant changes in viral load and CD4+ cell counts. The observed increase in viral replication is usually transient and a clear, measurable progression of the underlying HIV disease is hard to be determined. Several studies reported immunogenicity data in HIV+ population, by comparing diferfent influenza vaccines, adjuvanted or not, and different administration routes. Data are encouraging because an adequate immune response is shown, although split/subunit vaccines do not elicite an efficient immune response in these subjects. New strategies have been evaluated to increase the immune response in immunocompromised patients.The aim of this review is to evaluate tolerability, safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of vaccines actually approved for human use and to consider latest evidence and future perspective in HIV positive subjects."

The effects of linomide on insulin needs and beta cell function were studied in recent juvenile Type I diabetes in a double-blind trial. Patients with recent onset diabetes were randomly assigned to treatment with a fixed dose of 2.5 mg linomide (42 patients) or placebo (21 patients) for 1 year, in addition to insulin and diet. Glycated haemoglobin was 10-15% lower at 9 months (p = 0.003) and 12 months (p < 0.05) in the linomide group. The insulin dose was 32-40% smaller in the linomide group at 3 (p < 0.03), 6 (p < 0.02), 9 (p < 0.001) and 12 months (p = 0.01). Insulin doses correlated negatively with C peptide values (p = 0.001-0.002). The trend for higher C peptide values in the linomide group did not reach significance. In a post hoc subgroup analysis performed in 40 patients (25 from the linomide group and 15 from the placebo group) who still had detectable residual beta cell function at entry, linomide was associated with 45-59% higher C peptide value at 6 months (p < 0.05), 9 months (p < 0.05) and 12 months (p < 0.05). The main adverse effects of linomide were mild transitory anaemia (45 vs 10% in the linomide and placebo groups), thrombocytopenia (24 vs 10%), and mild joint discomfort (45 vs 5%) with no clinical signs. In conclusion, low-dose linomide reduced the insulin needs in patients with juvenile Type I diabetes of recent onset and improved beta cell function in patients who still had detectable beta cell function at entry. These results support further clinical and experimental studies to define the effects of linomide in Type I diabetes provided the safety of linomide is reliably established."

Here we report the results of three independent clinical trials performed in Japan to assess the immunogenicity, tolerability and safety of varying doses of a cell culture-derived MF59(®)-adjuvanted A/H1N1 pandemic vaccine in healthy Japanese paediatric, adult and elderly subjects.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      One hundred and twenty-three children (6 months-18 years), and 200 adults (19-60 years) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine containing either 7.5 μg antigen with a full (9.75 mg) adjuvant dose, or 3.75 μg antigen with a half (4.875 mg) adjuvant dose. One hundred elderly (≥ 61 years) subjects received only the low antigen/adjuvant vaccine formulation. Immunogenicity was assessed by haemagglutination inhibition assay at baseline and three weeks after the first and second vaccine doses on Days 22 and 43, respectively. Solicited and unsolicited adverse reactions were recorded for seven and 21 days post-immunization, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In adult and elderly subjects, a single low antigen/adjuvant dose vaccination was sufficient to meet all of the three European licensure criteria established for influenza vaccines. One high, or two low antigen/adjuvant dose vaccinations were required to meet the licensure criteria in paediatric subjects. Both vaccine formulations were well tolerated, with the majority of adverse reactions mild to moderate in severity. None of the five serious adverse events reported throughout the three trials were considered to be vaccine-related by the investigators.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The use of MF59 adjuvant allows for much reduced vaccine antigen content, and a single dose administration schedule in adults and the elderly. The production of pandemic vaccine using modern cell culture techniques is highly advantageous in terms of the quantity, quality, and rapidity of antigen production; these benefits, in combination with the use of MF59, maximize manufacturing capacity and global vaccine supply. These data support the suitability of the investigational vaccine for use in the Japanese paediatric, adult, and elderly populations."

            "abstract": "Vaccines are administered to healthy humans, including infants, so the safety and efficacy must be very high. Therefore, evaluating vaccine safety in preclinical and clinical studies, according to World Health Organization guidelines, is crucial for vaccine development and clinical use. A change in the route of administration is considered to alter a vaccine's immunogenicity. Several adjuvants have also been developed and approved for use in vaccines. However, the addition of adjuvants to vaccines may cause unwanted immune responses, including facial nerve paralysis and narcolepsy. Therefore, a more accurate and comprehensive strategy must be used to develope next-generation vaccines for ensuring vaccine safety. Previously, we have developed a system with which to evaluate vaccine safety in rats using a systematic vaccinological approach and 20 marker genes. In this study, we developed a safety evaluation system for nasally administered influenza vaccines and adjuvanted influenza vaccines using these marker genes. Expression of these genes increased dose-dependent manner when mice were intranasally administered the toxicity reference vaccine. When the adjuvant CpG K3 or a CpG-K3-combined influenza vaccine was administered intranasally, marker gene expression increased in a CpG-K3-dose-dependent way. A histopathological analysis indicated that marker gene expression correlated with vaccine- or adjuvant-induced phenotypic changes in the lung and nasal mucosa. We believe that the marker genes expression analyses will be useful in preclinical testing, adjuvant development, and selecting the appropriate dose of adjuvant in nasal administration vaccines."

In the course of screening anti-inflammatory agents, we obtained BSASM, a mixture of several plant extracts. This study was designed to investigate the AD-mitigating effect of BSASM in patients, as well as its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in an in vitro experiment. The anti-inflammatory effects of BSASM were evaluated by the level of production of proinflammatory cytokines. Clinical evaluation was also done using eczema area severity index (EASI) score in AD patients. BSASM inhibited LPS-induced activation of NF-kappaB promoter. In addition, LPS-induced an increase of IL-8, and the TNF-alpha production in THP-1 cells was also inhibited. These results suggest that BSASM has an anti-inflammatory activity. A clinical study in patients with AD showed that BSASM induced a reduction of EASI score, degree of pruritus, and TEWL on both the antecubital fossa and abdomen. Besides, BSASM had no irritative or allergic effects. Based on these results, we conclude that BSASM has anti-inflammatory and AD-mitigating effects."

The randomized, open-label study assessed two doses of H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 influenza vaccine (1·9 μg or 3·75 μg hemagglutinin antigen) formulated with AS03A or AS03B (11·89 mg or 5·93 mg tocopherol, respectively). Control groups received seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine. Safety was assessed prospectively and included potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs). Immunogenicity was assessed by hemagglutination-inhibition assay 12 and 24 months after vaccination; cross-reactivity and cell-mediated responses were also assessed. (NCT00502593).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The safety population included 405 children. Over 24 months, five events fulfilled the criteria for pIMDs, of which four occurred in H5N1 vaccine recipients, including uveitis (n = 1) and autoimmune hepatitis (n = 1), which were considered to be vaccine-related. Overall, safety profiles of the vaccines were clinically acceptable. Humoral immune responses at 12 and 24 months were reduced versus those observed after the second dose of vaccine, although still within the range of those observed after the first dose. Persistence of cell-mediated immunity was strong, and CD4(+) T cells with a TH 1 profile were observed.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Two doses of an AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine in children showed low but persistent humoral immune responses and a strong persistence of cell-mediated immunity, with clinically acceptable safety profiles up to 24 months following first vaccination."

            "abstract": "Fibrinogen γ-chain peptide-coated, adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP)-encapsulated liposomes (H12-ADP-liposomes) are a potent haemostatic adjuvant to promote platelet thrombi. These liposomes are lipid particles coated with specific binding sites for platelet GPIIb/IIIa and encapsulating ADP. They work at bleeding sites, facilitating haemostasis by promoting aggregation of activated platelets and releasing ADP to strongly activate platelets. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of H12-ADP-liposomes on post-cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) coagulopathy in a preclinical setting. We created a post-CPB coagulopathy model using male New Zealand White rabbits (body weight, 3 kg). One hour after CPB, subject rabbits were intravenously administered H12-ADP-liposomes with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) collected from donor rabbits (H12-ADP-liposome/PRP group, n = 8) or PRP alone (PRP group, n = 8). Ear bleeding time was greatly reduced for the H12-ADP-liposome/PRP group (263 ± 111 s) compared with the PRP group (441 ± 108 s, p < 0.001). Electron microscopy showed platelet thrombus containing liposomes at the bleeding site in the H12-ADP-liposome/PRP group. However, such liposome-involved platelet thrombi were not observed in the end organs after H12-ADP-liposome administration. These findings suggest that H12-ADP-liposomes could help effectively and safely consolidate platelet haemostasis in post-CPB coagulopathy and may have potential for reducing bleeding complications after cardiovascular surgery with CPB."

Currently, thousands of eukaryotic kinase inhibitors are commercially available, have well-characterized targets, and often carry pharmaceutically favorable toxicity profiles. Recently, our group disclosed that derivatives of the natural product meridianin D, a known inhibitor of eukaryotic kinases, modulated behaviors of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Herein, we expand our exploration of kinase inhibitors in Gram-negative bacilli utilizing three commercially available kinase inhibitor libraries and, ultimately, identify two chemical structures that potentiate colistin (polymyxin E) in multiple strains. We report IMD-0354, an inhibitor of IKK-β, as a markedly effective adjuvant in colistin-resistant bacteria and also describe AR-12 (OSU-03012), an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1), as a potentiator in colistin-sensitive strains. This report comprises the first description of the novel cross-reactivity of these molecules."

Increased antibody levels to hemagglutinin (HA) and NP, particularly to detergent treated NP, was seen in narcolepsy. Higher levels of antibodies to NP were found in children with DQB1*06:02 risk allele and in DQB1*06:02 transgenic mice immunized with Pandemrix when compared to controls.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This work identified 1) higher amounts of structurally altered viral NP in Pandemrix than in Arepanrix, 2) detergent-induced antigenic changes of viral NP, that are recognized by antibodies from children with narcolepsy, and 3) increased antibody response to NP in association of DQB1*06:02 risk allele of narcolepsy.

The 78 HSCT recipients, aged 11-72 (median 50) years, were vaccinated 1-290 (median 27) months post-HSCT. Of the 55 allogeneic HSCT recipients, 50.9% received reduced intensity conditioning, 74.5% had a sibling donor, 67.2% had active graft-versus-host disease and 43.6% were on steroid therapy. At baseline, 14/78 (17.9%) had HI titers ≥ 1:40. Blood samples of 77 patients were available post-1st vaccination; of these, 34 (44.2%) patients had HI titers ≥ 1:40. Blood samples of 43 patients were available post-2nd vaccination; of these, 21 (48.8%) had HI titers ≥ 1:40. There was a significant increase in HI titers ≥ 1:40 from baseline to both post-1st and 2nd vaccinations (p<0.001 each), and also from 1st to 2nd vaccination (p=0.008). In seronegative (HI titers <1:10) patients, whose sera were available before, after one dose, and after 2 doses of vaccine, seroconversion (to ≥ 1:40) occurred in 4/24 (16.7%) after 1-dose and in a total of 10/24 (41.7%) after 2-dose vaccination (p=0.031). Logistic regression analysis revealed that ≥ 1:40 HI titers were significantly associated with higher lymphocyte counts and higher HI baseline titers and, in allogeneic HSCT, with having a sibling donor and higher baseline titers.

Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. For each recipient, a licensed and age-appropriate vaccine should be used. Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) are expected to be available. Most influenza vaccines available for the 2020-21 season will be quadrivalent, with the exception of MF59-adjuvanted IIV, which is expected to be available in both quadrivalent and trivalent formulations.Updates to the recommendations described in this report reflect discussions during public meetings of ACIP held on October 23, 2019; February 26, 2020; and June 24, 2020. Primary updates to this report include the following two items. First, the composition of 2020-21 U.S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B/Victoria lineage components. Second, recent licensures of two new influenza vaccines, Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent and Fluad Quadrivalent, are discussed. Both new vaccines are licensed for persons aged ≥65 years. Additional changes include updated discussion of contraindications and precautions to influenza vaccination and the accompanying Table, updated discussion concerning use of LAIV4 in the setting of influenza antiviral medication use, and updated recommendations concerning vaccination of persons with egg allergy who receive either cell culture-based IIV4 (ccIIV4) or RIV4.The 2020-21 influenza season will coincide with the continued or recurrent circulation of SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus associated with coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]). Influenza vaccination of persons aged ≥6 months to reduce prevalence of illness caused by influenza will reduce symptoms that might be confused with those of COVID-19. Prevention of and reduction in the severity of influenza illness and reduction of outpatient illnesses, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit admissions through influenza vaccination also could alleviate stress on the U.S. health care system. Guidance for vaccine planning during the pandemic is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html.This report focuses on recommendations for the use of vaccines for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza during the 2020-21 season in the United States.

OM-85 BV had no effect on seroconversion or seroprotection rates, geometric mean titres, or dendritic cells, which were not significantly different between the two groups. Moreover, OM-85 BV did not significantly increase the pool of the memory B cells that produce IgG and IgM antibodies against the influenza antigens. However, respiratory morbidity was significantly lower in the children treated with OM-85 BV (p<0.05), thus confirming its positive effect on the incidence of RRTIs. There was no difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two groups.

STF2.4xM2e (VAX102) is a recombinant fusion protein that links four tandem copies of the M2e antigen to Salmonella typhimurium flagellin, a TLR5 ligand used as an adjuvant. The objectives of this first-in-human study were to assess the safety and immunogenicity of VAX102 given as a prime-boost regimen to healthy adults.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Sixty subjects 18-49 years old were enrolled in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Study 1). Based on pre-clincial data, initial design included doses starting at 10 μg, with an escalation plan. After reactogenicity was noted at the 10 μg dose, the trial was redesigned to evaluate 0.3, 1.0, and 3 μg doses. Following this study, 16 subjects were enrolled in Study 2, an open label, low dose study, to evaluate doses of 0.03 and 0.1 μg. In both trials, vaccine or placebo was given intramuscularly (i.m.) at 0 and 28 days. Clinical and laboratory safety assessments took place 1 and 7 days after immunization. Immune responses to M2e and flagellin were assessed by ELISA at 7, 14 and 28 days after each dose. Seroconversion was defined as a serum IgG anti-M2e antibody value ≥0.174 μg/ml and a fourfold rise in concentration.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Doses of 0.03-1 μg were safe and well tolerated in all subjects. Doses of 0.03 and 0.1 μg produced limited immunogenicity (38% and 75% respectively), after the second dose of vaccine. Doses of 0.3 and 1.0 μg were immunogenic in 18 (75%) of 24 vaccinees after the first dose and 23 (96%) after the second dose. In the 1.0 μg group, the geometric mean M2e antibody concentration was 0.4 μg/ml after the first dose and 1.7 μg/ml after the booster dose. M2e antibody concentrations and seroconversion rates were not significantly different at higher doses (p>0.05). Immune response to flagellin was robust but did not appear to interfere with M2e antibody responses after the booster dose. Following the first injection of VAX102 at higher doses (3 and 10 μg), self-limited but severe symptoms were noted in some subjects and were associated with elevated levels of C-reactive protein. Although not directly measured, this reaction was believed to be mediated by cytokine release.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      VAX102 was safe and induced high antibody levels to M2e at 0.3 and 1.0 μg doses. The TLR5 ligand, S. typhimurium flagellin, is a novel approach to adjuvant-like activity through activation of innate immunity, and when fused to multiple copies of the M2e protein, the vaccine was able to induce a fourfold rise in antibody in humans, to a previously non-immunogenic, highly-conserved portion of the influenza virus. Clinical correlates of protection that may be afforded by M2e antibody in humans are a future focus of investigation."

Twenty healthy volunteers were first injected with increasing doses of IMP321 alone (safety for first-in-man use).

All vaccine formulations were found to be generally well tolerated with similar frequency and intensity of adverse reaction in groups receiving IMP321 as in controls. Post-vaccination humoral immune responses, as determined 29 and 57 days later by assay of hemagglutinin inhibition activity were similar for both IMP321 and control groups. In contrast, the addition of 10, 30 or 100 microg IMP321 to the flu vaccine resulted in higher levels of Th1-type (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha or IL-2) flu-specific CD4 T cells in PBMC recovered at D29 and D57 and tested in a short-term ex vivo restimulation assay (6-colour FACS analysis after intra-cellular staining of cytokines).

This provided a unique opportunity to compare immunogenicity and clinical protection in the same population and thus provide insights into the correlates of protection for the pandemic H1N1 2009 vaccine in risk groups. While clinical protection from AS03-adjuvanted pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccine was high in those aged <25 years and pregnant women, effectiveness in older adults with chronic conditions has been found to be surprisingly poor. Here we present results from the immunogenicity study derived from the same population. Individuals from priority groups eligible for pandemic vaccination attending participating general practices were recruited. Pre and post-vaccination blood samples were collected and HI antibody testing to assess immune response to vaccination performed. The final cohort consisted of 610 individuals: 60 healthy children aged <5 years; 32 healthy pregnant women; 518 individuals from risk groups. Seroconversion rate in healthy children aged <5 years (87%, 95% CI: 75% to 94%) was higher than that of risk groups combined (65%, 95% CI: 61% to 69%) (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis of risk groups showed that the size of response in those who did seroconvert was lower in those who received the 2009/10 seasonal TIV (Fold effect: 0.52, 0.35 to 0.78). Predicted immunological boosting from higher pre-vaccine titres after 2009 pandemic H1N1 vaccination only occurred in children (seroconversion rate = 92%) and not in individuals aged 10 to 39 from risk groups (seroconversion rate = 74%). The lack of clinical protection identified in the same population in older adults from risk groups could be attributed to these lower seroresponses.

We review this knowledge and consider the advantages of the rabbit for immunological studies. The langomorph species is proximate to primates on the phylogenetic scale, its amino acid sequence of Abeta is 97% identical to the human Abeta sequence, and the rabbit model system is extensively characterized on a form of associative learning with parallels in normal aging in rabbits and humans that is severely impaired in human AD. Cholesterol-fed rabbits treated with Abeta immunotherapy generate high titer anti-Abeta responses.

We also report on some international issues affecting vaccine manufacture, and compare pH1N1 influenza vaccination programs in several industrialized countries. WHO's pandemic declaration was the trigger for Canada to take the following steps: (1) implement its sole source pandemic vaccine supply contract, (2) use an alternate, internationally-developed approach to authorize emergency use of adjuvant-containing vaccine not yet fully approved in Canada, (3) release stocks of antiviral, and (4) develop many health-related policies, through committees other than those normally used outside a pandemic. We note key successes and challenges in these steps, and suggest responses to two priority issues: first, improve planning for surges in demand for the clinical services that represent the main way in which severe disease impact was reduced, and second, establish from the outset of Public Health planning that immunization programs will phase use of vaccine in different target groups, as done elsewhere, reflecting realistic vaccine delivery rates and the likely early occurrence of the main epidemic wave."

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an unprecedented effort toward the development of an effective and safe vaccine. Aided by extensive research efforts into characterizing and developing countermeasures towards prior coronavirus epidemics, as well as recent developments of diverse vaccine platform technologies, hundreds of vaccine candidates using dozens of delivery vehicles and routes have been proposed and evaluated preclinically. A high demand coupled with massive effort from researchers has led to the advancement of at least 31 candidate vaccines in clinical trials, many using platforms that have never before been approved for use in humans. This review will address the approach and requirements for a successful vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the background of the myriad of vaccine platforms currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 prevention, and a summary of the present results of those trials. It concludes with a perspective on formulation problems which remain to be addressed in COVID-19 vaccine development and antigens or adjuvants which may be worth further investigation."

            "abstract": "Immunostimulatory glucose polymers known as beta-glucans have been studied for many years. Our laboratory has prepared and characterized a novel microparticulate beta-glucan (MG) from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Because MG particles are rapidly phagocytized by murine peritoneal macrophages and induce the expression of B7 costimulatory molecules, we hypothesized that MG could serve as a vaccine adjuvant to enhance specific immune responses. Here, we describe a procedure for conjugating the test vaccine antigen bovine serum albumin (BSA) to MG via water-soluble carbodiimide linkage. Conjugates with up to 0.4 mg of BSA/mg MG were prepared. MG/BSA conjugates were still actively phagocytized by mouse peritoneal macrophages. When used to immunize mice by the intradermal route, these conjugates enhanced the primary IgG antibody response to BSA in a manner comparable to the prototypic complete Freund's adjuvant. Although primary oral immunization with MG/BSA caused no increase in serum anti-BSA antibody titers, booster immunization elicited a significant anti-BSA antibody response. These results suggest that protein antigens can be conjugated to MG via a carbodiimide linkage and that these conjugates provide an adjuvant effect for stimulating the antibody response to the protein antigens."

            "abstract": "Joint haemorrhage and subsequent haemophilic arthropathy are significant complications in haemophilia. The pathophysiology involves inflammation and angiogenesis. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors are anti-inflammatory agents, which have potent anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and analgesic properties yet do not affect platelet function in the manner of traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These properties make such agents potentially useful as adjunctive therapy in haemophilia. There is only one prior report describing rofecoxib treatment in a single haemophilia patient. Our objectives were to determine the safety and efficacy of rofecoxib in treating acute haemarthrosis, chronic synovitis, target joints and pain. We conducted a retrospective medical record review of patients treated with rofecoxib for acute haemarthrosis, chronic synovitis, target joint or pain. The safety and efficacy of rofecoxib treatment were determined based on subjective patient reports and physical examinations during follow-up clinic visits. A total of 28 patients between 3 and 37 years of age were treated for a total of 42 courses of rofecoxib treatment. All courses were evaluated for safety and 31 for efficacy. Rofecoxib was used for eight acute haemarthrosis, four target joints, seven cases of synovitis and 12 episodes of pain. Efficacy was demonstrated particularly for chronic synovitis and pain and no serious adverse events occurred. This is the largest study to date evaluating COX-2 inhibitors as adjunctive therapy in haemophilia and suggests that these agents may be an important adjunctive therapy in the management of haemophilia."

Antibody in nasal secretions and lung wash fluids from mice was increased after vaccination and lung virus was significantly reduced after challenge to a similar level in each adjuvant group. Interferon was selected for a trial in humans. Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine was given intranasally to healthy adult volunteers alone or with 1 million units (Mu) or 10 Mu of alpha interferon. Vaccinations were well tolerated but neither serum hemagglutination-inhibiting nor neutralizing antibody responses among the vaccine groups were significantly different. Similarly, neither neutralizing nor IgA antibody responses in nasal secretions were significantly different. Thus, despite exhibiting a significant adjuvant effect in mice, interferon did not exhibit an adjuvant effect for induction of antibody in respiratory secretions of humans to inactivated influenza virus vaccine given intranasally."

            "abstract": "To overcome the immunosuppressive milieu of malignancy and lack of well-defined antigens, potent adjuvants are needed for cancer immunotherapy. Numerous small molecular immunomodulators have the potential to fulfill this role. To enhance the immune response and decrease the toxicity, particulate systems including nanoparticles and macroparticles have been increasingly proposed as carriers for cancer antigen and adjuvant delivery. These systems have the potential to co-deliver the antigens and adjuvants simultaneously in the same particle. In addition, the particles can be engineered for localized and targeted delivery, whether it be to the cellular or sub-cellular level. These properties limit systemic side effects and improve delivery efficiency, and thus enhance the vaccine's immune response. In particular, the particles can be constructed to mimic the size and surface patterns of microbes, organisms to which we have evolved a strong immune response. The release characteristics of the particles can likewise be controlled to simulate the body's response to infections. Boosting the immune response of vaccines by virtue of their intrinsic immunostimulatory properties, these particles can be dosing-sparing and have the potential to reduce production cost of vaccines. As the interest in personalized cancer vaccines increases with their encouraging outcomes in clinical trials, particulate carrier systems have the potential to play an important role in optimizing cancer vaccines."

There was a significant difference in progression-free survival favoring the addition of mifamurtide in pulmonary metastatic and/or relapsed osteosarcoma. There was no significant difference in overall survival between the addition of mifamurtide and chemotherapy alone in metastatic osteosarcoma; however there was a significant difference favoring the addition of mifamurtide in non-metastatic osteosarcoma patients. The addition of mifamurtide resulted in a significant difference in survival after relapse in pulmonary metastatic and/or relapsed osteosarcoma patients. Both studies reported on mifamurtide-related adverse events - the first was reported as toxicity which included haematological, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal disorders, cardiac, rhythm and nervous system disorders, ear disorders and others (infection, fever; and performance status) in metastatic osteosarcoma patients. Results were similar across all combined treatment regimens. Although no statistical analysis was undertaken, the figures suggest there were no significant differences between the treatment regimens. In the other study, mifamurtide-related adverse events were reported as clinical toxic effects of mifamurtide in relapsed osteosarcoma, which included chills, fever and headache for the initial dose of mifamurtide, while for the subsequent doses of mifamurtide all patients reported toxicity as delayed fatigue.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The available evidence on the effectiveness of mifamurtide in addition to a standard chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of high-grade osteosarcoma is limited and therefore no definitive conclusions can be made."

The dismal prognosis of EC is mainly attributed to distant metastases, which may not be overcome by chemotherapy alone. Hence, the use of alternative adjuvant treatments, such as herbal medicines, for metastatic EC remains a great desire of patients. Our previous study demonstrated the in vivo anti-tumor and in vitro anti-invasion activities of Andrographis paniculata (AP) in esophageal cancer. In the present study, the chemical constituents of absorbed AP components through human intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayer were verified for the first time. The anti-migratory activities and suppressive effects on metastasis-related factors such as HER2, MMP2, MMP9, TM4SF3, CXCR4 of the absorbed AP components were revealed in esophageal cancer cells EC-109. The anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of AP water extract (1600 mg/kg) were further confirmed in metastatic esophageal xenograft-bearing mice. Besides, AP water extract acted synergistically with cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil on inhibiting tumor nodule growth (with combination index <0.7). Meanwhile, chemotherapeutics-induced side-effects could also be reduced by AP water extract. The present findings provide evidence on safety and advantages of the combined use of AP with chemotherapeutics in pre-clinical setting."

            "abstract": "Targeting epigenetic changes in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) may provide a novel treatment option for patients. This report demonstrates that sodium valproate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), can increase the cytotoxicity of carboplatin in an additive and synergistic manner in DIPG cells in vitro. Sodium valproate causes a dose-dependent decrease in DIPG cell viability in three independent ex vivo cell lines. Furthermore, sodium valproate caused an increase in acetylation of histone H3. Changes in cell viability were consistent with an induction of apoptosis in DIPG cells in vitro, determined by flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V staining and assessment of apoptotic markers by western blotting. Subsequently, immunofluorescent staining of neuronal and glial markers was used to determine toxicity in normal rat hippocampal cells. Pre-treatment of cells with sodium valproate enhanced the cytotoxic effects of carboplatin, in three DIPG cell lines tested. These results demonstrate that sodium valproate causes increased histone H3 acetylation indicative of HDAC inhibition, which is inversely correlated with a reduction in cell viability. Cell viability is reduced through an induction of apoptosis in DIPG cells. Sodium valproate potentiates carboplatin cytotoxicity and prompts further work to define the mechanism responsible for the synergy between these two drugs and determine in vivo efficacy. These findings support the use of sodium valproate as an adjuvant treatment for DIPG."

A number of vaccine types were reviewed, including classical egg-derived and cell culture-derived inactivated vaccines, such as split virus or whole-virion vaccines, and live-attenuated vaccines (LAIV), as well as vaccines developed using new technologies. The amount of antigen needed, the effect of adjuvants and the number of doses required to induce adequate antibody responses in various populations, together with the issue of safety of the vaccines, were major topics of the meeting. The effectiveness of H1N1 vaccines and the need for standardization of vaccine potency tests were also discussed. Independent of the vaccine type and the presence or absence of an adjuvant, all A (H1N1) 2009 vaccines were well tolerated, eliciting only mild to moderate local or systemic reactions. For most vaccines tested, a single dose was sufficient to elicit a potentially protective antibody response in the majority of vaccinees >10 years of age.

However, vaccines made from recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) subunit protein are often of low potency, requiring high dose or boosting to generate a sustained immune response. We have improved the immunogenicity of a plant-made HA vaccine by chemical conjugation to the surface of the Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) which is non infectious in mammals. We have previously shown that TMV is taken up by mammalian dendritic cells and is a highly effective antigen carrier. In this work, we tested several TMV-HA conjugation chemistries, and compared immunogenicity in mice as measured by anti-HA IgG titers and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI). Importantly, pre-existing immunity to TMV did not reduce initial or boosted titers. Further optimization included dosing with and without alum or oil-in water adjuvants. Surprisingly, we were able to stimulate potent immunogenicity and HAI titers with a single 15 µg dose of HA as a TMV conjugate. We then evaluated the efficacy of the TMV-HA vaccine in a lethal virus challenge in mice. Our results show that a single dose of the TMV-HA conjugate vaccine is sufficient to generate 50% survival, or 100% survival with adjuvant, compared with 10% survival after vaccination with a commercially available H1N1 vaccine. TMV-HA is an effective dose-sparing influenza vaccine, using a single-step process to rapidly generate large quantities of highly effective flu vaccine from an otherwise low potency HA subunit protein."

Vaccine adjuvants are one approach to boost the immunogenicity of antigens in populations with reduced immunity. Ideally, vaccine adjuvants will increase the seroconversion rates across the population, lead to stronger immune responses, and enable the administration of fewer vaccine doses. We previously demonstrated that a cationic liposomal formulation of the commercial influenza split virus vaccine (CCS/C-HA) enhanced cellular and humoral immunity to the virus, increased seroconversion rates, and improved survival after live virus challenge in a preclinical model, as compared to the commercial vaccine as is (F-HA). We now evaluated vaccine efficacy in different strains and sexes of mice and determined the role of innate immunity in the mechanism of action of the CCS/C adjuvant by testing the response of mice deficient in Toll-like receptors or the TLR/IL-1 adaptor protein MyD88 following immunization with CCS/C-HA vs. F-HA. Although TLR2- and TLR4-deficient mice responded to F-HA immunization, F-HA immunization failed to engender a significant immune response in the absence of MyD88. In contrast, immunization with the CCS/C-HA vaccine overcame the requirement for MyD88 in the response to the commercial vaccine and improved the immune responses and seroconversion rates in all strains of mice tested, including those deficient in TLR2 and TLR4."

Current vaccines protect against influenza only when well matched to the circulating strains. However, antigenic drift can cause considerable mismatches between vaccine and circulating strains, substantially reducing vaccine effectiveness. Moreover, current seasonal vaccines are ineffective against pandemic influenza, and production of a vaccine matched to a newly emerging virus strain takes months. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for a broadly protective influenza virus vaccine. We aimed to test the ability of chimeric H1 haemagglutinin-based universal influenza virus vaccine candidates to induce broadly cross-reactive antibodies targeting the stalk domain of group 1 haemagglutinin-expressing influenza viruses.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We did a randomised, observer-blinded, phase 1 study in healthy adults in two centres in the USA.

Up to 12 years of follow-up data suggest that the drug remains effective on T2 magnetic resonance imaging burden of disease in those who stay on therapy. Initially, the major problem with interferon-beta1b was a lack of tolerability due to high incidents of skin reactions and influenza-like side effects.

As controls, experiments were performed on wild-type mice (WT).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The administration of DHEA in IL-6(-/-) mice did not affect mortality, as it was not significantly different from WT mice without DHEA application. The cellular immune response was influenced, as seen by a significant reduction in the percentage of CD8+ and NK cells in WT animals.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Mortality rates in IL-6(-/-) mouse strains were not lowered by DHEA; therefore, a limited effect of IL-6 on this pathway has to be proposed. NK cells may be one of the effector cells of the protective mechanisms of DHEA, whilst the role of CD8+ lymphocytes remains unclear. Consequently, DHEA might be presented as a possible adjuvant therapy after septic insult for modulation of the dysregulated immune system."

            "abstract": "Seasonal influenza continues to have a huge annual impact in the United States, accounting for tens of millions of illnesses, hundreds of thousands of excess hospitalizations, and tens of thousands of excess deaths. Vaccination remains the mainstay for the prevention of influenza. In the United States, 2 types of influenza vaccine are currently licensed: trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine and live attenuated influenza vaccine. Both are safe and effective in the populations for which they are approved for use. Children, adults <65 years of age, and the elderly all receive substantial health benefits from vaccination. In addition, vaccination appears to be cost-effective, if not cost saving, across the age spectrum. Despite long-standing recommendations for the routine vaccination of persons in high-priority groups, US vaccination rates remain too low across all age groups. Important issues to be addressed include improving vaccine delivery to current and expanded target groups, ensuring timely availability of adequate vaccine supply, and development of even more effective vaccines. Development of a vaccine against potentially pandemic strains is an essential part of the strategy to control and prevent a pandemic outbreak. The use of existing technologies for influenza vaccine production would be the most straightforward approach, because these technologies are commercially available and licensing would be relatively simple. Approaches currently being tested include subvirion inactivated vaccines and cold-adapted, live attenuated vaccines. Preliminary results have suggested that, for some pandemic antigens, particularly H5, subvirion inactivated vaccines are poorly immunogenic, for reasons that are not clear. Data from evaluation of live pandemic vaccines are pending. Second-generation approaches designed to provide improved immune responses at lower doses have focused on adjuvants such as alum and MF59, which are currently licensed for influenza or other vaccines. Additional experimental approaches are required to achieve the ultimate goal for seasonal and pandemic influenza prevention--namely, the ability to generate broadly cross-reactive and durable protection in humans."

            "abstract": "In children with minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS), the steroid dependent group constitutes an especially difficult case for management. Patients in this group are prone to serious steroid side effects. Additionally, alkylating agents commonly fail to maintain remission and expose patients to more side effects. Therapy with the immunostimulant drug levamisole may therefore be another option in the attempt to maintain remission with minimal side effects. We prospectively treated 20 of our steroid dependent primary MCNS patients with levamisole. All patients were children, with an age range of 3-15 years; 16 were boys and 4 were girls. Remission was firstly induced by steroids, then levamisole was added in a dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight on alternate days for 6 months. During this period we attempted to withdraw steroids completely and maintain patients on levamisole alone. We followed up our patients for the occurrence of relapse and side effects during this period and for a further 6 months after stopping levamisole. In 11 out of 20 children (55%), we successfully stopped steroids for more than 2 weeks. At the end of the 6-month treatment period (i.e. after 4 months of steroid discontinuation), ten patients (50%) were maintaining remission on levamisole alone. At the end of the 12-month study period (i.e. after 6 months of levamisole discontinuation), five patients (25%) were still in remission without any treatment for the previous 6 months. No significant side effects were reported during levamisole therapy. None of the patients developed neutropenia, but the leukocyte count showed a significant reduction in those who responded to levamisole treatment. We concluded that levamisole therapy for 6 months is a safe and perhaps effective therapy in a subset of children with steroid dependent MCNS to enable an otherwise infeasible withdrawal of steroids. This may be worth a trial before other types of more hazardous adjunctive therapies are considered."

For them, there is an unmet need for better influenza vaccines. Oil-in-water emulsion-adjuvanted influenza vaccines are promising candidates, but clinical trials yielded inconsistent results. Here, we meta-analyze randomized controlled trials with efficacy data (3 trials, n = 15,310) and immunogenicity data (17 trials, n = 9062). Compared with non-adjuvanted counterparts, adjuvanted influenza vaccines provide a significantly better protection (weighted estimate for risk ratio of RT-PCR-confirmed influenza: 0.26) and are significantly more immunogenic (weighted estimates for seroprotection rate ratio: 4.6 to 7.9) in healthy immunologically naive young children. Nevertheless, in immunologically non-naive children, adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines provide similar protection and are similarly immunogenic.

The same seems to hold true for human allergen provocation tests in vivo. We conclude that combinations of second-generation antihistamines and anti-leukotrienes deserve a large-scale clinical trial for preventing and/or treating attacks of allergic asthma.

Exploratory analyses assessed the cell-mediated immune response (CMI) up to Month 12 and the influence of previous influenza vaccination on persistence of immune response. At Month 6, the CHMP criteria were met in subjects aged 18-60 y who received one or two vaccine doses and in subjects aged>60 y who received two vaccine doses. At Month 12, the CHMP criteria were met only in subjects aged 18-60 y who received two vaccine doses.

By analyzing mutation levels, it was possible to distinguish sequences from cells that were recently activated from naïve B cells from those that were activated by memory recall. We show that the adjuvant functions through two mechanisms. First, the adjuvant stimulates increased activation of naïve B cells, thus reducing immune interference with previous vaccine responses. Second, the adjuvant is able to increase the adaptability of the recalled cells to give improved specificity to the new vaccine antigen. We thus show how AS03 enhances pH1N1 immune responses, and reduces immune interference."

Local reactions were similar in all four vaccines after the first two immunizations but were significantly increased in incidence and severity following the third immunization with vaccine WcPh. This appeared to be due to the Ph adjuvant rather than the antigen component. Febrile reactions were experienced more often (P = .0009) and with higher temperatures (P = .0001) with the WcPh vaccine following the first immunization. This appeared to be due to the Wc component. Comparing the pooled Wc groups with the pooled E groups revealed a greater febrile response in the Wc group after both the first (P = .0008) and the second (P = .03) immunization. Local reactions appear temporally and etiologically to be distinct from febrile reactions. The pooled Wc antigen group produced a higher geometric mean titer than the pooled E antigen group (P = .05).

The percentage of subjects attaining protective HI titers (>/=40%) was comparable in both groups for the A/Bayern (P=.5) and B/Beijing (P=.3) strains but was higher among young adults (92.2%) versus elderly subjects (76.5%; P=.057) for the A/Wuhan strain. The proportion of subjects with nonprotective baseline titers who attained protective levels after immunization was similar in both age groups for the A/Bayern and B/Beijing components. For the A/Wuhan component, significantly (P=.017) more young adults achieved protective titers versus elderly subjects (85. 7% and 53.8%, respectively). Vaccination evoked a significant (P<. 005) increase in anti-HLT antibody titers."

            "abstract": "Although shown to be a potent stimulator of serum antibody responses in animal models, the adjuvant immuno-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs) showed little adjuvant effect for inactivated influenza vaccines in a volunteer study. The result may be the non-comparability of the studies: animal studies were carried out chiefly in unprimed mice, while volunteers are mostly primed by previous infection and/or immunization. To test this, Balb/C mice were infected with influenza viruses or immunized with inactivated influenza vaccine, and subsequently given inactivated vaccine in saline or incorporated into ISCOMs. The serum in antibody responses was measured 1 month after immunization. The results confirm the adjuvant activity of ISCOM in unprimed mice, and show a marked reduction in adjuvant activity for primed mice. We argue that ISCOMs are important to prime the T cell response necessary for the serum antibody response to saline vaccine, but largely unnecessary where priming has been accomplished by prior exposure to influenza antigens. Further, the value of ISCOMs may lie in promoting antibody responses in unprimed subjects, and not in enhancing antibody titres."

            "abstract": "Enterotoxin-based adjuvants including cholera toxin and heat-labile toxin (LT) are powerful manipulators of mucosal immunity; however, past clinical trials identified unacceptable neurological toxicity when LT or mutant AB5 adjuvant proteins were added to intranasal vaccines. Here, we examined the isolated enzymatic A1 domain of LT (LTA1) for intranasal safety and efficacy in combination with influenza (flu) vaccination. LTA1-treated mice exhibited no neurotoxicity, as measured by olfactory system testing and H&E staining of nasal tissue in contrast with cholera toxin. In vaccination studies, intranasal LTA1 enhanced immune responses to inactivated virus antigen and subsequent protection against H1N1 flu challenge in mice (8-week or 24-months). In addition, lung H1N1 viral titers post-challenge correlated to serum antibody responses; however, enhanced protection was also observed in μMT mice lacking B-cells while activation and recruitment of CD4 T-cells into the lung was apparent. Thus, we report that LTA1 protein is a novel, safe and effective enterotoxin adjuvant that improves protection of an intranasal flu vaccination by a mechanism that does not appear to require B-cells."

            "abstract": "The relative capacities of two classes of immunomodulator to augment the deficient immunity of senescent mice were evaluated. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used as the prototype for modulators that depend on normal membrane function for signal transduction, and 8-mercaptoguanosine (8MGuo) represents a class of immunomodulator that transverses the cell membrane and induces its effects from an intracellular location. The current studies demonstrate that 8MGuo induces polyclonal immunoglobulin production in cultures from both young and senescent mice, whereas LPS can induce such activity only in cell cultures from young adult mice. Furthermore, LPS was unable to enhance the magnitude of antigen-specific responses in aged mice, in contrast to the marked adjuvant effects of 8MGuo. 8MGuo, but not LPS, provided an effective T cell-like signal that induced responsiveness to a T-dependent antigen in B cells from senescent mice. These B cells thus were able to transduce antigen-specific (first) but not nonspecific (second) signals, provided by agents such as LPS, across the cell membrane. Together, these observations suggest that the C8-derivatized guanine ribonucleosides substantially improve the immunodeficiency of aging by short-circuiting a B cell defect and providing a perceived second signal to lymphocytes from senescent animals."

The high socioeconomic burden of such conditions justifies increasing interest in novel osteoinductive drugs for adjuvant therapeutic approaches. There is an increasing body of experimental and clinical literature on potentially promising effects of growth factors, anti-resorptive, and anabolic agents. The true clinical efficacy of these, however, is discussed controversially. Therefore, we aimed to critically examine the hypothesis that targeted adjuvant therapies have the potential to enhance bone regeneration in critical-size bone defects and under systemic conditions that impair bone healing. This first approach to the topic deals with small molecule drugs and compounds that influence the immune response and inflammatory processes. In particular, literature reporting on selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors has been reviewed with respect to their local and systemic mode of action and to stimulate further research on bone healing under critical conditions."

The primary objectives were to assess the non-inferiority of aTIV to TIV, measured by geometric mean titers (GMTs), and the safety of aTIV and TIV. Seroconversion was one of several secondary objectives. In total, 287 children were enrolled. The non-inferiority criteria for GMTs and seroconversion were met for aTIV for all 3 vaccine strains. Lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals for all 3 aTIV:TIV vaccine ratios were >2, showing that the immunogenicity of aTIV was superior to that of TIV for all 3 strains. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were experienced more frequently with aTIV than TIV by younger children (aged 6 to <36 months), but were more frequent with TIV than aTIV in older children (aged 36 to <72 months) who had been vaccinated previously. More unsolicited AEs were associated with aTIV than the TIV. All AEs were of mild or moderate severity. No deaths, serious AEs, or AEs leading to premature withdrawal were reported.

However, conventional vaccine adjuvants fail to induce potent cellular immunity, and their toxicity and side-effects hinder the clinical use. Therefore, a vaccine adjuvant which is safe and can induce an antigen-specific cellular immunity-biased immune response is urgently required. In the development of nanoparticle-based vaccine adjuvants, the hydrophobicity is one of the most important factors. It could control the interaction between the encapsulated antigens and/or nanoparticles with immune cells. In this study, nanoparticles (NPs) composed of amphiphilic poly(γ-glutamic acid)-graft-L-phenylalanine ethyl ester (γ-PGA-Phe) with various grafting degrees of hydrophobic side chains were prepared to evaluate the effect of hydrophobicity of vaccine carriers on the antigen encapsulation behavior, cellular uptake, activation of dendritic cells (DCs), and induction of antigen-specific cellular immunity-biased immune responses. These NPs could efficiently encapsulate antigens, and the uptake amount of the encapsulated antigen by DCs was dependent on the hydrophobicity of γ-PGA-Phe NPs. Moreover, the activation potential of the DCs and the induction of antigen-specific cellular immunity were correlated with the hydrophobicity of γ-PGA-Phe NPs. By controlling the hydrophobicity of antigen-encapsulated γ-PGA-Phe NPs, the activation potential of DCs was able to manipulate about 5 to 30-hold than the conventional vaccine, and the cellular immunity was about 10 to 40-hold. These results suggest that the hydrophobicity of NPs is a key factor for changing the interaction between NPs and immune cells, and thus the induction of cellular immunity-biased immune response could be achieved by controlling the hydrophobicity of them."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical and microbiological stability and murine immunogenicity of low-dose JJA VIT formulated with a novel polysaccharide adjuvant referred to as delta inulin or Advax™. Jack Jumper ant venom (JJAV) protein stability was assessed by UPLC-UV, SDS-PAGE, SDS-PAGE immunoblot, and ELISA inhibition. Diffraction light scattering was used to assess particle size distribution of Advax; pH and benzyl alcohol quantification by UPLC-UV were used to assess the physicochemical stability of JJAV diluent, and endotoxin content and preservative efficacy test was used to investigate the microbiological properties of the adjuvanted VIT formulation. To assess the effect of adjuvant on JJA venom immunogenicity, mice were immunised four times with JJAV alone or formulated with Advax adjuvant. JJA VIT formulated with Advax was found to be physicochemically and microbiologically stable for at least 2 days when stored at 4 and 25 °C with a trend for an increase in allergenic potency observed beyond 2 days of storage. Low-dose JJAV formulated with Advax adjuvant induced significantly higher JJAV-specific IgG than a 5-fold higher dose of JJAV alone, consistent with a powerful allergen-sparing effect. The pharmaceutical data provides important guidance on the formulation, storage and use of JJA VIT formulated with Advax adjuvant, with the murine immunogenicity studies providing a strong rationale for a planned clinical trial to test the ability of Advax adjuvant to achieve 4-fold JJAV dose sparing in JJA-allergic human patients."

We hypothesized that intracellular copper levels may affect the sensitivity of oral cancer cells to curcumin.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We analysed the correlation between intracellular copper levels and response to curcumin treatment in a panel of OSCC cell lines derived from oral cancer patients. Exogenous copper was supplemented in curcumin insensitive cell lines to observe the effect of copper on curcumin-mediated inhibition of cell viability and migration, as well as induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis. Protein markers of cell migration and oxidative stress were also analysed using Western blotting.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Concentrations of curcumin which inhibited 50% OSCC cell viability (IC50) was reduced up to 5 times in the presence of 250 µM copper. Increased copper level in curcumin-treated OSCC cells was accompanied by the induction of intracellular ROS and increased level of Nrf2 which regulates oxidative stress responses in cells. Supplemental copper also inhibited migration of curcumin-treated cells with enhanced level of E-cadherin and decreased vimentin, indications of suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Early apoptosis was observed in combined treatment but not in treatment with curcumin or copper alone.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Supplement of copper significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of curcumin treatment on migration and viability of oral cancer cells. Together, these findings provide molecular insight into the role of copper in overcoming insensitivity of oral cancer cells to curcumin treatment, suggesting a new strategy for cancer therapy."

Patients (n = 108) received five weekly IA injections of hyaluronic acid 20 mg (Hyalgan) under sterile conditions, and were observed for up to 12 months after the last injection. Some patients received a second series of injections after 4 to 8 months. For the 59 patients who were observed for 12 months after the first treatment cycle, evaluation of pain according to a visual analog scale showed significant improvements lasting 12 months, with pain during load, pain at rest, and duration of walking ability compared with a baseline evaluation. Patients who required a second treatment cycle showed a further amelioration. Significant improvements were also seen in knee function and in global evaluations by both patient and investigators. Relief of symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee was seen as early as 4 weeks after treatment in 68% of patients receiving IA hyaluronic acid. In 55% of these patients, relief was maintained until the end of the 12-month follow-up."

Similarly, we report for pandemic influenza vaccination little added benefit of the second dose. We confirm lowest increase in HI titer in rituximab-treated AIRD compared to other medications. Vaccination largely tilts the balance from negative ELISA A IgG and IgA titers to positive titers in seasonal H1N1 seroresponsive AIRD patients and controls. A significant decrease in HI GMT and seroprotection was observed only in AIRD at > 180 days after vaccination highlighting an absent persistence of immunogenic response in AIRD patients. Due to high initial HI titers for influenza vaccine, we foresee their benefit in personalized medicine in the future.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Influenza vaccination is immunologically active for AIRD, with little value of the second dose of the pandemic vaccine and further scrutiny on persistence of immune response to vaccine in AIRD is needed."

            "abstract": "The development of a universal vaccine for influenza A virus (IAV) that does not require seasonal modification is a long-standing health goal, particularly in the context of the increasing threat of new global pandemics. Vaccines that specifically induce T cell responses are of considerable interest because they can target viral proteins that are more likely to be shared between different virus strains and subtypes and hence provide effective cross-reactive IAV immunity. From a practical perspective, such vaccines should induce T cell responses with long-lasting memory, while also being simple to manufacture and cost-effective. Here we describe the synthesis and evaluation of a vaccine platform based on solid phase peptide synthesis and bio-orthogonal conjugation methodologies. The chemical approach involves covalently attaching synthetic long peptides from a virus-associated protein to a powerful adjuvant molecule, α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer). Strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition is used as a simple and efficient method for conjugation, and pseudoproline methodology is used to increase the efficiency of the peptide synthesis. α-GalCer is a glycolipid that stimulates NKT cells, a population of lymphoid-resident immune cells that can provide potent stimulatory signals to antigen-presenting cells engaged in driving proliferation and differentiation of peptide-specific T cells. When used in mice, the vaccine induced T cell responses that provided effective prophylactic protection against IAV infection, with the speed of viral clearance greater than that seen from previous viral exposure. These findings are significant because the vaccines are highly defined, quick to synthesize, and easily characterized and are therefore appropriate for large scale affordable manufacture."

It is the general experience that immunomodulatory agents (IMA) are only partially effective in RR patients. Recent data on the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapies for these patients are encouraging. The anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of CTX have been utilized to treat selected cases of multiple sclerosis with a progressive and worsening course as rescue therapy. Thirty RR MS patients with clinically defined MS who experienced treatment failure during IFN beta therapy (2 or more relapses per year or 1.5 EDSS point worsening in one year) were enrolled in the study and treated with CTX iv pulse therapy added to IFN beta and followed up for 24 months. As primary endpoints we evaluated the yearly relapse rate. We also evaluated the percentage of patients free of relapses and of EDSS variations. We analysed the results at one year before entry (T0: IFN beta alone), 12 (T1) and 24 (T2) months after entry. Brain MRI was performed at T0, at T1 and T2. The 30 RR patients who had experienced a high number of relapses (rr =1.4) at T0 showed a significant improvement in yearly relapse rate (rr = 0.4) at T1 and a further improvement (rr = 0.17) at T2 (p < 0.001). The percentage of patients free of relapse was 70% at T2 (p < 0.0001). EDSS score changed from 2.6+/-1.23 at T0 to 2.2 +/- 1.5 at T2, showing only a trend of improvement. No significant variation of MRI lesion load and no severe adverse events were recorded during the study. These data showed that the combination of CTX plus IFN beta halted the progression of disease in active and deteriorating MS patients suggesting the necessity of RCTs to test the efficacy of this combination therapy in active RRMS patients or in patients who experienced treatment failure in response to disease modifying drugs (DMDs)."

Free CpG ODNs have been used in many clinical trials implemented to verify their effects. However, recent research has reported that self-assembled CpG ODNs, protein/peptide-CpG ODN conjugates, and nanomaterial-CpG ODN complexes demonstrate higher adjuvant effects than free CpG ODNs, owing to their improved uptake efficiency into cells expressing TLR9. Moreover, protein/peptide-CpG ODN conjugates and nanomaterial-CpG ODN complexes are able to deliver CpG ODNs and antigens (or allergens) to the same types of cells, which enables a higher degree of prophylaxis or therapeutic effect.
