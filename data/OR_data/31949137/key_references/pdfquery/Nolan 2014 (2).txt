Background. The vaccine efﬁcacy (VE) of 1 or 2 doses of AS03-adjuvanted inﬂuenza A(H1N1) vaccine relative 
to that of 2 doses of nonadjuvanted inﬂuenza A(H1N1) vaccine in children 6 months to <10 years of age in a mul- 
tinational study conducted during 2010–2011. 
Methods. A total of 6145 children were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive 2 injections 21 days 
apart of A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-AS03 vaccine at dose 1 and saline placebo at dose 2, 2 doses 21 days apart 
of A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-AS03 vaccine (the Ad2 group), or 2 doses 21 days apart of nonadjuvanted A/Cali- 
fornia/7/2009(H1N1) vaccine (the NAd2 group). Active surveillance for inﬂuenza-like illnesses continued from days 
14 to 385. Nose and throat samples obtained during inﬂuenza-like illnesses were tested for A/California/7/2009 
(H1N1), using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety were 
assessed. 
Results. There were 23 cases of conﬁrmed 2009 pandemic inﬂuenza A(H1N1) (A[H1N1]pdm09) infection for 
the primary relative VE analysis. The VE in the Ad2 group relative to that in the NAd2 group was 76.8% (95% con- 
ﬁdence interval, 18.5%–93.4%). The beneﬁt of the AS03 adjuvant was demonstrated in terms of the greater immu- 
nogenicity observed in the Ad2 group, compared with the NAd2 group. 
Conclusion. The 4–8-fold antigen-sparing adjuvanted pandemic inﬂuenza vaccine demonstrated superior and 
clinically important prevention of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, compared with nonadjuvanted vaccine, with no ob- 
served increase in medically attended or serious adverse events. These data support the use of adjuvanted inﬂuenza 
vaccines during inﬂuenza pandemics.

Children have high inﬂuenza attack rates and are key to viral 
transmission among households, daycare centers, and schools 
[1, 2]. During the 2009–2010 pandemic of inﬂuenza A(H1N1) 
(hereafter, A[H1N1]pdm09) infection, the highest attack rates 
were observed in children <18 years of age [3]. Inactivated inﬂu- 
enza vaccines historically have shown only moderate efﬁcacy in 
children, particularly among those <2 years of age [4], although 
improved efﬁcacy of an oil-in-water–adjuvanted (MF59) triva- 
lent seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine was recently reported in young 
children [5]. Moreover, an antigen-sparing AS03-adjuvanted in- 
activated pandemic inﬂuenza vaccine against A(H1N1)pdm09 
offered children superior immunogenicity relative to conven- 
tional unadjuvanted formulations, with an acceptable safety 
proﬁle [6]. Therefore, in a large cohort of children, we used 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based conﬁrmation 
of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection to evaluate the efﬁcacy of a split 
virion A/California/7/2009(H1N1)v-like AS03-adjuvanted vac- 
cine (H1N1-AS03; Arepanrix [GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines]) rel- 
ative to that of a nonadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine made with the 
same virus strain but formulated at a conventional dose in pre- 
venting A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Antibody persistence was 
monitored for either 6 months or 1 year after vaccination. 
Our objective was to assess whether the vaccine candidate’s su- 
perior immunogenicity translated into improved disease 
prevention. 

Study Design and Subjects 
This randomized, prospective phase 3 observer-blinded study 
was conducted in 17 centers in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, 
Costa Rica, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand 
between 15 February 2010 and 19 August 2011. The study 
was approved by an institutional review board at each partici- 
pating center. Written informed consent was obtained from 
parents or guardians of participating healthy children 6 months 
to <10 years (6 month to <10) of age before the children re- 
ceived the ﬁrst vaccine dose. 
Randomization 
Participants were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1:1 to 1 of 3 
treatment groups to receive 2 intramuscular injections 21 days 
apart. Group Ad1 received H1N1-AS03 at dose 1 and placebo 
(saline) at dose 2; group Ad2 received 2 doses of H1N1-AS03; 
group NAd2 received 2 doses of nonadjuvanted A/California/7/ 
2009(H1N1) vaccine. The randomization procedure used a 
minimization algorithm accounting for center, age stratum (6 
to <36 months or 3 to <10 years), and prior seasonal inﬂuenza 
vaccination status. These factors had equal weight in the 
minimization algorithm; that is, a participant’s vaccine group 
allocation was based on the balance of the combination of all 
the minimization factors. Each age stratum was capped such 

that it could contribute no more than 75% to the total 
population. 
Vaccines 
Each dose of H1N1-AS03 vaccine contained 1.9 µg of hemag- 
glutinin (HA) mixed with AS03B in a total delivery volume of 
0.25 mL. AS03B is an oil-in-water emulsion containing squalene 
and DL-α-tocopherol (5.93 mg) in an aqueous phase [7]. 
The nonadjuvanted vaccine contained 30 µg of HA in 1 mL, 
and the volume (ie, HA dose) administered varied with age: 
children <3 years of age in the NAd2 group received two 
0.25-mL doses (ie, 7.5 µg of HA), and children 3 to <10 years 
of age received two 0.5-mL doses (ie, 15 µg of HA). Placebo 
was 0.5 mL of saline. Single lots of the adjuvanted antigen, non- 
adjuvanted antigen, and adjuvant were used. Vaccines were ad- 
ministered into the deltoid (or anterior thigh, if the child was 
<12 months of age), using a needle length suitable for intramus- 
cular administration. 
Study Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efﬁcacy of 2 doses of 
H1N1-AS03 relative to that of 2 doses of nonadjuvanted vaccine 
beginning 14 days after dose 1 and continuing until study con- 
clusion on day 385. Noninferiority in terms of relative vaccine 
efﬁcacy (VE) was concluded if the lower limit of the 95% con- 
ﬁdence interval (CI) for relative VE against real-time PCR– 
conﬁrmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection (Ad2 vs NAd2) was 
≥33%. Superiority was concluded if the lower limit of the 
95% CI for relative VE was >0. 
Secondary study objectives with predeﬁned criteria (and no 
type 1 error adjustment) included (1) VE for Ad1 relative to 
that of NAd2, using the same criteria speciﬁed for the primary 
objective; (2) relative VE for any pneumonia, any pneumonia 
in individuals within 6 weeks of real-time PCR–positive 
A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, and any inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI); 
and (3) assessment of speciﬁc antibody titers at day 42. 
The adjuvant effect on immunogenicity was assessed by com- 
paring A/California/7/09 hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) an- 
tibody responses at day 42 in terms of geometric mean titer 
(GMT) ratios and differences in seroconversion rate (SCR) by 
group. Adjuvant effect was demonstrated if the lower limit of 
the 95% CI for GMT ratio was >1.0 and the lower limit of 
the 95% CI for the group difference in the seroconversion rate 
was >0. 
Reactogenicity and safety of the study vaccines and antibody 
persistence at days 182 and 385 were summarized descriptively 
as part of the evaluation of secondary objectives. 
Evaluation of Inﬂuenza Outcomes 
Passive surveillance began on day 0 and active surveillance via 
telephone contacts began for all subjects approximately 2 weeks 
after dose 1 and continued every 1–2 weeks until day 385. Par- 
ents and legal guardians notiﬁed the investigator if the child 
developed an ILI (deﬁned as a temperature ≥38.0°C by any 
route and at least 1 of the following: new or worsening cough, 
sore throat, nasal congestion, and/or rhinorrhea). Nasal and 
throat swab specimens were collected within 7 days after 
symptom onset. A 7-day symptom-free period was required 
between ILI episodes to consider the subsequent episode dis- 
tinct from the initial episode. Detection of inﬂuenza A(H1N1) 
pdm09, using real-time PCR (and of all inﬂuenza virus strains, 
using multiplex PCR), is described in the Supplementary Ma- 
terials. Only real-time PCR–positive samples underwent viral 
culture [8]. 
Immunogenicity Assessment 
Blood samples were collected before vaccination and 21 days 
after receipt of dose 2 (ie, on day 42) from all subjects. HI an- 
tibody levels were measured in a random subset of approxi- 
mately 60 children in each treatment group from each 
participating country. The HI assay used chicken erythrocytes 
[9–11], and the lowest dilution tested was 1:10. The titration 
end point was the highest dilution step that showed complete 
(ie, 100%) inhibition of hemagglutination. A further blood sam- 
ple was collected at either day 182 or day 385 from consenting 
subjects. 
Safety and Reactogenicity Assessment 
Injection site and systemic symptoms were recorded on diary 
cards for 7 days after each dose. Solicited symptoms were 
based on the ability to report by age and were therefore different 
in younger children (age, <6 years) versus older children (age, 
≥6 years). All other adverse events (AEs) were recorded from 
the ﬁrst dose until day 42. Medically attended AEs, serious 
AEs (SAEs), and potential immune-mediated diseases were re- 
corded until day 385. All solicited injection site reactions were 
considered causally related to vaccination. Potentially causal re- 
lationships between vaccination and all other AEs were assessed 
by the site investigator. 
Statistical Methods 
The analysis was performed by an externally contracted statis- 
tical analyst. A second statistician from the same company per- 
formed an independent quality validation. 
Vaccine Efﬁcacy 
Efﬁcacy was assessed in the according-to-protocol (ATP) efﬁca- 
cy cohort, which included all evaluable subjects who received 2 
doses, who were successfully contacted at least once after the 
ﬁrst vaccination, and who complied with protocol-deﬁned pro- 
cedures. The relative VE was calculated as 1 − relative risk (RR), 
where the RR is deﬁned as the risk of real-time PCR–conﬁrmed 
cases among subjects receiving H1N1-AS03 versus the risk of 
real-time PCR–conﬁrmed cases among subjects receiving 
NAd2. RR was estimated via a Cox proportional hazard regres- 
sion model (time to ﬁrst event), with vaccine group as a ﬁxed 
variable, and was adjusted by covariates of age, seasonal inﬂu- 
enza vaccine history, and country. Subjects meeting censoring

according to protocol; NAd2, 2 doses of nonadjuvanted A/California/7/2009(H1N1) vaccine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 
a Subjects with protocol deviation or violation were excluded from the ATP cohort. However, subjects who received concomitant medication or vaccine were 
included in the time-to-event efficacy analysis and were censored at the time when the concomitant medication or vaccine was received. 
b Three additional cases occurred before day 14. 




























medication or receipt of nonprotocol vaccines containing A/ 
California/7/09-like H1N1 antigen) were included in the anal- 
ysis until the date of censoring or were excluded if the censoring 
criteria were met before the disease end point occurred. The rel- 
ative VE (with 95% CI) was calculated for the 14–385-day ( pri- 
mary end point) and 0–385-day surveillance periods. Secondary 
analyses were done on the total vaccinated cohort, which in- 
cluded all children who received at least 1 vaccine dose. 
During study preparation the future behavior of the pan- 
demic was uncertain, but we projected a substantive third 
wave in 2010. On the basis of 1800 evaluable subjects per 
group, an assumed attack rate of 20% among unvaccinated sub- 
jects, and an assumed VE for nonadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of 
40%, if 360 real-time PCR–conﬁrmed inﬂuenza cases were 
identiﬁed during the surveillance period, a lower limit of 
≥33% for the 95% CI for the relative VE could be demonstrated 
with >99.9% power, if the VE in the H1N1-AS03 group was 
assumed to be 60% relative to that of a notional placebo. 
Type 1 error adjustment was not made for secondary objective 
evaluations. 
Immunogenicity End Points 
The following parameters were calculated (with 95% CIs) based 
on A/California/7/09 HI titers: GMT; seroconversion rate, de- 
ﬁned as the percentage of initially seronegative subjects (titer, 
<1:10) with a postvaccination titer of ≥1:40 or the percentage 
of initially seropositive vaccinees (titer, ≥1:10) with a ≥4-fold 
increase in the postvaccination titer; seroprotection rate, deﬁned 
as the percentage of subjects with titers of ≥1:40 [12, 13]; and 
seroconversion factor, deﬁned as the ratio of the postvaccination 
titer to the prevaccination titer. 
Reactogenicity End Points 
Reactogenicity data were summarized by vaccine group and age 
stratum (from 6 months to <6 years and from 6 to <10 years) 
because a different AE intensity scale was used for children of 
different ages. 

Study Subjects 
Each study center contributed between 105 (1.7%) and 886 
(14.4%) of the total 6145 enrolled and vaccinated subjects. Of 
these, 5900 (96%) completed the study to day 42, and 5851 
(95%) completed the study to day 385. Two children in the 
Ad1 group withdrew before day 42 because of an AE or SAE: 
1 child died of asthma and pneumonia 20 days after dose 1, 
and 1 child had a nonserious upper respiratory tract infection. 
Two children in Ad2 were withdrawn before day 385 because of 
SAEs: 1 child drowned, and 1 died from an intestinal 
Kaplan–Meier time-to-event curve for real-time polymerase chain reaction–conﬁrmed 2009 pandemic inﬂuenza A(H1N1) infection reported from 
Figure 1.

obstruction associated with parasitic gastroenteritis and aspira- 
tion pneumonia (95 days after dose 2). No event leading to 
withdrawal was considered related to vaccination. Subject ﬂow 
through the study and reasons for withdrawal and elimination 
from ATP cohorts are given in Supplementary Figure 1. 
The mean age (±SD) of all children at enrollment was 
4.3 ± 2.64 years (range, 0.5–9 years); 49.8% (3058/6145) were 
female. The study groups in each analysis cohort were compa- 
rable in terms of demographic characteristics (Supplementary 
Table 1). 
Vaccine Efﬁcacy 
There were 3731 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected 
from 4653 ILI episodes (81%). Multiplex PCR–conﬁrmed inﬂu- 
enza virus infection (any strain from days 14 to 385) occurred in 
9.7% (95% CI, 8.4%–11.1%) of children in the Ad2 group, 8.4% 
(95% CI, 7.2%–9.8%) in the Ad1 group, and 9.3% (95% CI, 
8.1%–10.7%) in the NAd2 group. 
During the entire study follow-up period, 28 children had 
real-time PCR–conﬁrmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection (Table 1): 
11 were in the Philippines, 7 were in Thailand, 5 were in Aus- 
tralia, 3 were in Mexico, and 1 each was in Singapore and Costa 
Rica. Three children developed inﬂuenza before day 14. One 
child (in the NAd2 group) received the second vaccination 4 
days after the protocol-speciﬁed visit window. One subject (in 
the NAd2 group) was censored upon receiving seasonal triva- 
lent vaccine 8 months after dose 1 and 3 months before onset 
of A(H1N1)pdm09 disease. Therefore, among 5803 children in- 
cluded in ATP time-to-event efﬁcacy analysis (days 14–385), 23 
had real-time PCR-conﬁrmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, giv- 
ing an attack rate in each group of 0.15% (in the Ad2 group), 
0.34% (in the Ad1 group), and 0.68% (in the NAd2 group) in 
the ATP cohort (Figure 1). 
The efﬁcacy of Ad2 over NAd2 for prevention of real-time 
PCR-conﬁrmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection from days 14 to 385 
was 76.8% (95% CI, 18.5%–93.4%). Both noninferiority and 
superiority of Ad2 versus NAd2 were thus demonstrated accord- 
ing to the prespeciﬁed statistical criteria (Table 2). The relative VE 
without adjustment for covariates of age, seasonal inﬂuenza vac- 
cine history, and country was 77.1% (95% CI, 19.6%–93.5%). 
Efﬁcacy, noninferiority, and superiority of the 2-dose adju- 
vanted regimen were conﬁrmed in the analysis of the total vac- 
cinated cohort: the efﬁcacy estimate for Ad2 over NAd2 was 
78.5% (95% CI, 25.1%–93.8%; days 14–385). 
Secondary analyses showed that Ad2 was noninferior to 
NAd2 for efﬁcacy in preventing culture-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza 
(days 14–385) and in preventing real-time PCR–conﬁrmed 
A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in the subgroup aged 3 to <10 years 
(Table 1). Noninferiority was also observed for these end points 
in the total vaccinated cohort analysis (data not shown). 
The noninferiority criteria were not met for Ad1 versus NAd2 
for the ATP population or at any analysis interval (days 14–385 or 

and Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use criteria 
(deﬁned in Table 3) were fulﬁlled by all treatment groups (over- 
all and by each age stratum) at day 42. 
Adjuvant effect (Ad2 vs NAd2 groups) was demonstrated in 
terms of seroconversion rate (lower limit of the 95% CI for the 
difference between groups, 7.2%) and GMT ratios (lower limit 
for 95% CI, 4.9). Adjuvant effect was also demonstrated in both 
age strata (lower limit for 95% CI for the difference in serocon- 
version rate between groups, 10.3% for ages 6 to <36 months 
and 1.4% for ages 3 to <10 years; lower limit for the 95% CI 
of the GMT ratio, 7.7 for ages 6 to <36 months and 2.4 for 
ages 3 to <10 years; Figure 2). 
Adjuvant effect was also observed for Ad1 versus NAd2 
in terms of seroconversion rate overall (lower limit of the 
95% CI for the difference between groups, 0.9%) but not 
for GMT ratios. Adjuvant effect was observed for children 
aged 6 to <36 months in terms of seroconversion rate (lower 
limit of the 95% CI for the difference between groups, 8.6%) 
and GMT ratios (lower limit for the 95% CI on the GMT 
ratio, 1.3). 
At day 385, the seroprotection rate was 97.3% for Ad2, 78.5% 
for Ad1, and 67.9% for NAd2 (Table 3). HI GMTs were highest 
in the Ad2 group at all postvaccination time points (Table 3). 
Reactogenicity and Safety 
Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported symp- 
tom in all groups after each dose (Figure 3) and was more fre- 
quent for Ad2 than NAd2. Grade 3 injection site reactions 
were reported by no more than 4.3% of children after either dose. 
The percentage of children in each age stratum reporting sys- 
temic solicited symptoms was similar among treatment groups 
and after doses 1 and 2 (Figure 3), with the exception of fever 
(oral or axillary temperature, ≥38.0°C) in the Ad2 group, which 
increased from 10.2% (95% CI, 8.6%–11.9%) after dose 1 to 
19.0% (95% CI, 16.9%–21.2%) after dose 2 in subjects aged 6 
months to <6 years (an increase was observed in the subgroups 
aged 6 to <36 months and 3 to <6 years; Supplementary Table 2) 
and from 4.8% (95% CI, 3.3%–6.6%) to 8.7% (95% CI, 6.7%– 
11.1%), respectively, in subjects aged 6 to <10 years. In the 
Ad2 group, grade 3 fever (oral or axillary temperature of 
≥39.0°C) was reported for 1.9% (95% CI, 1.2%–2.8%) of chil- 
dren aged 6 months to <6 years after dose 1 and for 3.1% 
(95% CI, 2.2%–4.2%) after dose 2. Fever (deﬁned as a temper- 
ature of >40.0°C) was only reported after dose 1: 2 episodes oc- 
curred in children in the Ad2 group, and 3 episodes occurred in 
each of the other groups (Supplementary Table 2). 
There were 15 children who experienced febrile convulsions 
through day 385: 4 were in the Ad2 group, 6 were in the Ad1 
group, and 5 were in the NAd2 group. Seven febrile convulsions 
were reported as SAEs (Table 4). None occurred within 42 days 
after vaccination, and none were considered vaccine related. One 
so-called convulsion (fever was absent) was reported through day

Immunogenicity 
The ATP immunogenicity subset included 1175 children at day 
42, 1693 at day 182, and 1526 at day 385. At day 42, the sero- 
protection rate was 100% for Ad2, 98.7% for Ad1, and 92.8% for 
NAd2 (Table 3). Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research

conﬁdence intervals. In children <6 years of age, grade 3 severity was deﬁned as pain (ie, crying when limb is moved or with spontaneous sensation of pain), 
redness or swelling in an area >100 mm in diameter, fever (ie, an oral or axillary temperature of ≥39.0°C), irritability (ie, crying that cannot be comforted or 
that prevents normal activity), drowsiness (ie, prevention of normal activity), and loss of appetite (not eating at all). In children 6 to <10 years of age, grade 3 
severity was deﬁned as pain that prevents normal activity, redness or swelling in an area >100 mm in diameter, fever (ie, an oral/axillary temperature of 
≥39.0°C), and, for all other symptoms, prevention of normal activity. 
42 after vaccination (onset, 7 days after vaccination in a subject 
from the Ad2 group who had preexisting epilepsy). The event 
lasted 6 days and was not considered to be vaccine related. 
Percentages of children with any AE within 42 days of vacci- 
nation requiring a medically attended visit were similar among 
groups (23.4% for the Ad2 group, 22.9% for the Ad1 group, and 
22.8% for the NAd2 group; Table 4). 
During the 42-day follow-up period, 0.5% of subjects in the 
Ad2 group, 0.9% in the Ad1 group, and 1.2% in the NAd2 
group reported at least 1 grade 3 AE. None of the grade 3 symp- 
toms reported in the Ad2 group were considered to be vaccine 
related. One case of grade 3 headache in the Ad1 group and 1 
case each of grade 3 vomiting and gastroenteritis in the NAd2 
group were assessed as potentially vaccine related. 
Percentages of children experiencing at least 1 SAE from days 
0 to 385 were 3.7% in the Ad2 group, 3.2% in the Ad1 group, 
and 3.3% in the NAd2 group. The 10 most frequently reported 
SAEs were similar across groups (Table 4). One SAE (which in- 
volved a subject in theAd1 group, who required an emergency 
department visit for gastroenteritis, with onset on the day of 
dose 2) was considered to be vaccine related. There were 3 
fatal events (all in the Philippines), and none were considered 
vaccine related: 1 involved a 10-year-old child (in the Ad2 
group), who drowned; 1 involved a 20-month-old child (in 
the Ad2 group), who died from intestinal obstruction, parasitic 
gastroenteritis, and aspiration pneumonia; and 1 involved a 6- 
month-old child (in the Ad1 group), who had a history of pneu- 
monia and asthma and died 20 days after vaccination from 
community-acquired pneumonia and asthma (real-time PCR 
negative). No autopsy was done. 
During the study period, 1 potential immune-mediated dis- 
ease was reported for the Ad2 group (0.05% of subjects), and 3 
and 4 for the Ad1 (0.15%) and NAd2 (0.2%) groups, respectively 
(Table 4). 

This is the ﬁrst prospective efﬁcacy study commencing during 
an inﬂuenza pandemic and the ﬁrst to assess an AS03- 
adjuvanted inactivated inﬂuenza vaccine in children. We found 
a clinically important and statistically signiﬁcant improvement 
in the efﬁcacy of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, compared with efﬁ- 
cacy of the nonadjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccine. Moreover, im- 
proved efﬁcacy was shown using one-fourth to one-eighth of 
the standard dose of HA, and noninferiority was shown for a 
single dose of adjuvanted vaccine (one-eighth to one-sixteenth

of the standard HA dose), although only in the total vaccinated 
cohort (exploratory analysis). 
We observed lower than expected numbers of real-time 
PCR–conﬁrmed cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, most likely 
because of limited A(H1N1)pdm09 exposure during 2010, 
owing to the absence of the anticipated third pandemic wave 
during 2010 in the participating countries [14]. Furthermore, 
all study subjects received active inﬂuenza vaccination. We be- 
lieve our active surveillance was adequate, as many cases of ILI 
were evaluated, and subsequent testing revealed a substantial in- 
cidence of infection with respiratory syncytial virus and season- 
al inﬂuenza virus types A and B. Potential effects of variability 
between countries in active surveillance performance were min- 
imized by the randomization process. Overall inﬂuenza inci- 
dence rates in each group had overlapping 95% CIs, which 
does not support the proposition that the adjuvant groups ex- 
perienced an unqualiﬁed general reduction in risk. Neverthe- 
less, despite the low number of inﬂuenza cases, the relative 

Any unsolicited AE with a

VE of the adjuvanted vaccine after 2 doses was higher than es- 
timated and was sufﬁcient overall to reach a deﬁnitive conclu- 
sion. However, the low case numbers led to wide CIs for relative 
VE estimates and increased the uncertainty regarding our ex- 
ploration of secondary end points and subanalyses by age, al- 
though point estimates for relative VE were the same for 
subjects younger and those older than 3 years. 
This study commenced during the 2009–2010 inﬂuenza 
A(H1N1) pandemic in expectation of a third pandemic wave, 
and it was not considered ethically acceptable to include a pla- 
cebo group. Even though the study could not provide absolute 
VE values, these can be estimated using other sources from the 
literature. If an absolute VE of 40% for 2 doses of nonadju- 
vanted H1N1 vaccine is assumed (from the study by Vesikari 
et al [5], against mainly inﬂuenza A[H3N2]), the estimated ab- 
solute VE for Ad2 in our study is 86%; if an absolute VE for 
plain H1N1 antigen of 59% is assumed (efﬁcacy estimate 
from the same inﬂuenza A[H1N1] antigen in a quadrivalent 
formulation) [15], the estimated absolute VE for Ad2 is 90%, 
which is consistent with short-term vaccine effectiveness esti- 
mates (86%–100%) reported in case-control studies involving 
children and adults who received 1 dose of H1N1-AS03 [16– 
18]. Adjuvant beneﬁt in terms of immunogenicity, with higher 
and more persistent immune responses, was also demonstrated 
for 2 H1N1-AS03 doses over 2 nonadjuvanted vaccine doses, 
consistent with ﬁndings from previous clinical trials [6, 19]. 
Evidence from multiple clinical trials indicates transient in- 
crease in injection site reactions following AS03-adjuvanted ver- 
sus nonadjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccines, but there has been no 
evidence of an increased incidence of medically attended events 
or SAEs associated with AS03 use [7]. Consistent with these stud- 
ies, we observed higher rates of injection site pain in H1N1-AS03 
recipients than in nonadjuvanted vaccine recipients. However, 
grade 3 pain was reported for no more than 3.6% of children. Re- 
ported potential immune-mediated diseases were evenly distribu- 
ted across groups. The incidence of mild fever increased after the 
second H1N1-AS03 dose, as observed in other studies of this vac- 
cine in healthy children [20]. There was no clustering of febrile 
convulsion cases in temporal relationship to vaccination. 
After commencement of our study, several retrospective stud- 
ies suggested an association between vaccination with another 
A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine (PandemrixTM) and the subsequent 
onset of narcolepsy in individuals <21 years of age and in adults 
[21–31]. These retrospective observational studies alone are insuf- 
ﬁcient to ascribe the risk solely to the vaccine, as other factors 
may play a role. The recent identiﬁcation of an epitope in the 
H1N1 HA protein that mimics an epitope present within hypo- 
cretin [32] suggests that exposure of individuals with the HLA 
DQ0602 allele to H1N1 can result in an autoimmune response 
involving CD4+ T cells that could lead to the onset of narcolepsy. 
No narcolepsy cases were reported in the current study, which 
was too small to detect rare events such as narcolepsy. 
Our results provide evidence of the potential beneﬁt of AS03- 
adjuvanted pandemic inﬂuenza vaccines for control of future 
pandemics with respect to prevention of disease in a particularly 
vulnerable age segment. Similarly, the availability of effective ad- 
juvanted inﬂuenza vaccines for children with reduced antigen 
content could offer opportunities for improved control of season- 
al inﬂuenza. However, in either the seasonal or pandemic setting, 
use of AS03-adjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccines associated with injec- 
tion site symptoms, fever, and a theoretical risk of rarer events 
will need to be balanced against the risk of death or severe illness 
caused by the seasonal or pandemic inﬂuenza viral strains.
