Background: As multiple vaccines are administered concomitantly during 
routine pediatric immunizations, it is important to ascertain the potential 
interference of any new vaccine on the immune response to the concomi- 
tantly administered vaccines. Immune responses to meningococcal sero- 
group C–tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MnCC-TT) and the diphtheria 
and tetanus antigens in routine pediatric vaccines (diphtheria, tetanus, acel- 
lular pertussis–hepatitis B virus–inactivated poliovirus/Haemophilus influ- 
enza type b [DTaP–HBV–IPV/Hib] and DTaP–IPV+Hib) when given con- 
comitantly with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) 
were compared with responses when given with PCV7. In addition, the 
immunogenicity and safety of PCV13 were assessed. 
Methods: Healthy infants were randomized to receive PCV13 or PCV7 
(ages 2, 4, 6 and 15 months), concomitant with MnCC-TT (2, 4 and 
15 months), DTaP–HBV–IPV/Hib (2, 4 and 6 months), and DTaP–IPV+Hib 
(15 months). 
Results: Immune responses to MnCC-TT and to the diphtheria and teta- 
nus antigens administered with PCV13 were noninferior to the responses 
observed when the vaccines were administered with PCV7; 96.6 (postin- 
fant) and 99.4% (posttoddler) subjects achieved prespecified immune 
response levels to each antigen in each group. After the infant series, 
93.0% of subjects receiving PCV13 achieved pneumococcal anticapsu- 
lar immunoglobulin G concentrations ≥0.35 µg/mL for all serotypes except 
serotype 3 (86.2%), increasing to 98.1–100% for most serotypes (serotype 
3: 93.6%) after the toddler dose. Local and systemic reactions were similar 
between groups. 
Conclusions: Immune responses to MnCC-TT, and other childhood vac- 
cines (DTaP–HBV–IPV/Hib, DTaP–IPV+Hib) were noninferior when con- 
comitantly administered with PCV13 compared with PCV7. PCV13 does not 
interfere with MnCC-TT. PCV13 is highly immunogenic with a favorable 
safety profile.

licensed in 2000 in the United States and in 2001 in the European 
Union (EU).1,2 The introduction of PCV7 has led to dramatic reduc- 
tions in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) burden.3,4 
The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13; 
Prevenar 13; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.), contains the PCV7 
serotypes and 6 additional serotypes. The serotypes included in 
PCV13 are estimated to cause 80–92% of pneumococcal disease 
in children aged 5 years, globally.5 PCV13 has been approved 
for pediatric use in the EU, the United States and other countries 
worldwide. Noninferiority of PCV13 compared with PCV7 has 
been demonstrated in previous studies.6–8 
As multiple vaccines are administered concomitantly dur- 
ing routine pediatric immunizations, it is important to ascertain the 
potential interference of any new vaccine on the immune response 
to the concomitantly administered vaccines. In Spain, vaccination 
against meningococcal serogroup C is part of the routine national 
immunization schedule. Three different conjugate vaccines are 
available; this study used the meningococcal serogroup C–tetanus 
toxoid conjugate vaccine (MnCC-TT; NeisVac-C; Baxter Health- 
care, Deerfield, IL).

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the 
noninferiority of the immune responses to MnCC-TT vaccine as 
well as to the diphtheria and tetanus antigens present in routinely 
administered vaccines in the Spanish pediatric immunization 
schedule when these vaccines were administered concomitantly 
with PCV13 compared with PCV7. The responses to the diphtheria 
and tetanus antigens were of particular interest given the use of 
genetically modified diphtheria toxin and tetanus toxoid as immu- 
nologic carriers in the PCV and MnCC-TT vaccines. The routine 
pediatric vaccines containing these antigens included diphtheria, 
tetanus, acellular pertussis–hepatitis B virus–inactivated poliovi- 
rus/Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTaP–HBV–IPV/Hib; 
Infanrix hexa; GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) 
and DTaP–IPV+Hib vaccine (Infanrix–IPV+Hib, GlaxoSmithKline 
Biologicals). The immunogenicity and safety of PCV13 were also 
assessed. 

This parallel-group, randomized, active-controlled, dou- 
ble-blind study was conducted at 23 sites in Spain from July 
4, 2007 to March 23, 2009 (date of last 6-month follow-up tel- 
ephone contact). An independent ethics committee at each site 
reviewed and provided written approval of the protocol for this 
study. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical 
principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinki and was 
designed and performed in compliance with Good Clinical Prac- 
tice and applicable regulatory requirements. Written informed 
consent was obtained from parents/legal guardians of every sub- 
ject before enrollment in the study and before performance of 
any study-related procedures. 
Eligible infants were aged 42–98 days at enrollment and were 
healthy. Exclusion criteria included previous vaccination with any 
pneumococcal vaccine antigens required for the study; contrain- 
dication to vaccination with study vaccines; history of known or 
suspected immune deficiency or suppression, culture-proven inva- 
sive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or severe chronic 
disorder; prior receipt of blood products or gamma-globulin 
(including hepatitis B immunoglobulin and monoclonal antibod- 
ies); or prior participation in another investigational trial. 
This was a double-blind study, and all participants and study 
personnel were blind to treatment allocation. Subjects were ran- 
domly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive PCV13 or PCV7 at ages 
2, 4, 6 and 15 months, concomitant with MnCC-TT at 2, 4 and 
15 months, DTaP–HBV–IPV/Hib at 2, 4 and 6 months and DTaP– 
IPV+Hib at 15 months. Combination measles, mumps and rubella 
vaccine (Priorix; GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) was administered 
at 12 months. Vaccine regimens were based on national recommen- 
dations for pediatric immunization in Spain.9 Rotavirus vaccine 
was permitted at any time during the study. Varicella, hepatitis A 
and influenza vaccines were permitted, but not concomitantly with 
PCV7 or PCV13. Antipyretic medications were permitted to treat 
or prevent symptoms. 
PCV13 contains saccharides from pneumococcal serotypes 
1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F and 19A, and the PCV7 serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 
18C, 19F and 23F), all individually conjugated to cross-reactive 
material 197 (CRM197; a nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin). As 
with PCV7, PCV13 is formulated to contain 2.2 µg of each sac- 
charide except for 4.4 µg of 6B and 0.125 mg of aluminum phos- 
phate per 0.5-mL dose. The appearance of PCV13 and PCV7 was 
identical. 
Blood samples were collected 1 month after the second, 
third and toddler doses. Antigroup C meningococcal functional 
antibody titers were determined for the blood samples collected 1 
month after the second dose and 1 month after the toddler dose 
of MnCC-TT by a standardized serum bactericidal assay (SBA) 
using rabbit complement.10 Serum concentrations (IU/mL) of 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to tetanus toxoid and diph- 
theria toxoid were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorb- 
ent assay for the blood samples collected 1 month after the 3-dose 
DTaP–HBV–IPV/Hib series and 1 month after the DTaP–IPV+Hib 
toddler dose. For the PCV13 group, serotype-specific IgG serum 
concentrations were determined for each of the 13 pneumococcal 
serotypes using the standard pneumococcal enzyme-linked immu- 
nosorbent assay.11,12 

tenderness), 
systemic events (decreased appetite, irritability, increased or 
decreased sleep and fever) and use of antipyretic medications 
were monitored and recorded by parents/legal guardians in an 
electronic diary daily for 4 days after each vaccination. Tender- 
ness was recorded as none, present or interfered with limb move- 
ment. Redness and swelling were measured with a caliper (1 unit 
= 0.5 cm). Redness and swelling were categorized as absent, mild 
(0.5–2.0 cm), moderate (2.5–7.0 cm) or severe (>7.0 cm). Rectal 
temperature was measured daily at bedtime and whenever fever 
was suspected for 4 days after each vaccination; the highest tem- 
perature of the day was reported. Fever was categorized as absent 
(,38°C), mild (≥38.0 to ≤39.0°C), moderate (>39.0°C to ≤40.0°C) 
or severe (>40.0°C). Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) and seri- 
ous AEs were also recorded. 
Statistical Analysis 
Sample Size Determination 
The study was powered to show immunologic noninfe- 
riority of the response to concomitant vaccine antigens when 
administered with PCV13 relative to administration with 
PCV7. Assuming a dropout rate of ≤10%, 440 subjects had to 
be enrolled to ensure 195 evaluable subjects per group. A sam- 
ple size of 195 per group was required to provide ≥94% overall 
power to declare noninferiority for all 3 concomitant vaccine 
antigen comparisons using a noninferiority criterion of 0.10 and 
a 2-sided, type I error rate of 0.05. In addition, a sample size of 
195 evaluable subjects permitted estimation of the proportion 
of subjects achieving a pneumococcal antibody concentration 
≥0.35 µg/mL to within ± 4.5%. 

The evaluable concomitant vaccine immunogenicity popula- 
tions included subjects who received all doses of all assigned study 
vaccinations for their age group, had a valid and determinate assay 
result for the planned analysis and had no protocol violations. The 
evaluable pneumococcal immunogenicity populations included 
subjects randomly assigned to the PCV13 group who received all 
expected study vaccinations for their age group, had no protocol 
violations and had ≥1 valid and determinate infant series pneumo- 
coccal assay result after both doses 2 and 3 (evaluable pneumo- 
coccal infant immunogenicity population) or after the toddler dose 
(evaluable pneumococcal toddler immunogenicity population). 
All subjects who received ≥1 dose of study vaccine were in the 
safety population. Separate safety populations were defined for 
each vaccination. 

Endpoints for vaccines concomitantly administered with 
PCV13 or PCV7 included the proportion of subjects who achieved 
prespecified antibody levels (meningococcal C SBA titer ≥1:8,13 
diphtheria IgG ≥0.10 IU/mL14 and tetanus IgG ≥0.10 IU/mL15) after 
the infant series and toddler dose. For each concomitant vaccine 
antigen separately, exact, unconditional, 2-sided 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) on the difference (PCV13 − PCV7) in proportions 




of subjects achieving a prespecified antibody level were calculated. 
Noninferiority was declared if the lower bound of the CIs for the 
difference was >−0.10. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) 
or geometric mean titers were also calculated for antibodies to the 
concomitant vaccine antigens at each time point, and 2-sided 95% 
CIs were constructed; the response of the PCV13 group was com- 
pared with that of the PCV7 group using a 2-fold criterion, that is, 
evaluating whether the lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of 
geometric means was >0.5. 
Endpoints for PCV13 included the proportion of subjects in 
the PCV13 group achieving a serotype-specific IgG antibody con- 
centration ≥0.35 µg/mL—a reference antibody concentration for 
assessment of vaccine efficacy against IPD defined by the World 
Health Organization.16 Exact, unconditional, 2-sided 95% CIs on 
the proportions were calculated for each serotype, and the difference 
between the proportions 1 month after dose 2 and the proportions 
1 month after dose 3 was calculated (2-sided 95% CI for depend- 
ent proportions). Serotype-specific IgG GMCs were measured 
1 month after doses 2 and 3 of the infant series, and 1 month after 
the toddler dose; 2-sided 95% CIs were constructed for pneumo- 
coccal IgG GMCs for each pneumococcal serotype and time point. 
Fold rises in antibody concentrations from postdose 2 to postdose 3 
were summarized using geometric mean fold rises and CIs. 
The incidences of local reactions, systemic events and AEs 
were summarized separately for each dose of study vaccine. Statis- 
tical differences in incidences between PCV13 and PCV7 groups 
were evaluated using the Fisher exact test. 

A total of 449 subjects were randomized: 223 to PCV13 and 
226 to PCV7 (Fig. 1, which presents a Consolidated CONSORT 
diagram of subject disposition; Fig., Supplemental Digital Content 
1, http://links.lww.com/INF/B101). The evaluable concomitant vac- 
cine immunogenicity populations comprised 206 and 218 subjects 
in the PCV13 and PCV7 groups, respectively, after 2 doses; 197 
and 212 subjects, respectively, after 3 doses; and 164 and 172 sub- 
jects, respectively, after the toddler dose. The evaluable pneumo- 
coccal immunogenicity population, which only included subjects 
in the PCV13 group, comprised 199 subjects postinfant series and 
162 subjects posttoddler dose. The sample-size calculations of 195 
per vaccine group were for the primary endpoint, which is noninfe- 
riority of the concomitant vaccine responses after the infant series. 
These numbers do not apply after the toddler dose, where antibody 
concentrations are higher and fewer subjects would be required for 
the secondary objective. For the concomitant and pneumococcal 
immunogenicity populations, results were similar for the all-avail- 
able and evaluable populations both postinfant series and posttod- 
dler dose; therefore, only the results for the evaluable populations 
are reported. 
Demographic characteristics were similar for the 2 vaccine 
groups (data not shown). For the dose 1 safety population, 50.5% 
of subjects were male and 99.1% were white. Age at dose 1 was a 
median of 2.0 months (range, 1.3–3.4 months). 
Immunogenicity: Concomitant Vaccine 
Antigens 
The noninferiority criteria were met for the meningococcal 
C antigen in the PCV13 group compared with the PCV7 postinfant 
series and posttoddler dose (Table 1). The proportions of responders 
to meningococcal C antigen were high and similar in both groups 
after the infant series and after the toddler dose. The meningococ- 
cal C antigen geometric mean titers were similar in both groups 
after the infant series and toddler dose, and increased substantially 
from postinfant series to posttoddler dose, demonstrating a booster 
response. Similar results were obtained for the concomitant diph- 
theria and tetanus antigens (Table 1). 

Immunogenicity to pneumococcal serotypes was only deter- 
mined for the PCV13 group (Tables 2 and 3). After dose 2, >80% of 
subjects achieved a pneumococcal serotype-specific IgG antibody 
concentration ≥0.35 µg/mL for most PCV13 serotypes; the most 
notable exceptions were serotypes 6B (27.9%) and 23F (55.8%) 
(Table 2). The proportion of responders increased from dose 2 to 
dose 3 for most serotypes; the response increased to 94.9% for 
serotype 6B and to 93.0% for serotype 23F. Similar increases in 
serotype-specific IgG GMCs were also seen when comparing the 
postdose 2 and postdose 3 responses (Table 3). 
The proportion of subjects with pneumococcal IgG anti- 
body concentration ≥0.35 µg/mL increased after the toddler dose 
to >98% for all serotypes except serotype 3, which increased to 
93.6% (Table 2). IgG GMCs were substantially higher after the tod- 
dler dose compared with after the infant series, for all serotypes 
(Table 3). 

Local reactions were similar for the PCV13 and PCV7 groups 
(Table 4). Most local reactions were mild in severity. Significant ten- 
derness that interfered with leg movement was reported in ≤4% of 
subjects in either vaccine group after each infant and toddler dose. 
There were no reports of severe swelling with any infant or toddler 
dose. Severe redness was reported for only 1 infant vaccinated with 
PCV13, after dose 3. 
The frequency of most systemic events was similar for the 
PCV13 and PCV7 groups, with the exception of irritability, which 
had a higher frequency in the PCV7 group than the PCV13 group 
after the toddler dose (53.6 versus 41.5%; P = 0.025) (Table 4). Fever 
>40°C was reported in 1 infant in the PCV7 group after dose 1 and in 
1 toddler in the PCV13 group. Antipyretic medication use was similar 
in both groups. 
Most AEs were of the types expected for infants and tod- 
dlers. No subjects died, and none withdrew due to AEs. During 
the infant series, the frequency of AEs was significantly higher in 
the PCV7 group (57.3%) than in the PCV13 group (46.3%; P = 
0.023). The most frequent AEs were infections and infestations, 
which were reported more frequently in the PCV7 group than in 
the PCV13 group (48.9 versus 39.4%; P = 0.056). In both vac- 
cine groups, most of these events were infections and infestations, 
and there were no clear trends between groups within this or other 
AE categories. Among individual AEs, the only significant differ- 
ence between groups was noted for rash, which occurred in 2.7% 
of infants in the PCV7 group and no infants in the PCV13 group 
(P = 0.030). After toddler vaccination, the frequency of AEs did not 
differ significantly between groups. 

This study demonstrates that immune responses to MnCC-TT 
and to the diphtheria and tetanus antigens in routine pediatric vac- 
cines (DTaP–HBV–IPV/Hib or DTaP–IPV+Hib) were noninferior 
in the PCV13 group compared with the responses in the PCV7 
group. PCV13 does not interfere with MnCC-TT. 
These results are consistent with those of other studies of 
routine childhood vaccinations administered concomitantly with 
PCV13.8,17–20 In particular, 2 studies in which MnCC-TT vac- 
cine was administered concomitantly with PCV13 and 1 study 
in Spain in which MnCC-CRM197 vaccine was administered 
concomitantly with PCV13 demonstrated no interference with

the antimeningococcal C response.17–19 In addition, a study of 
PCV7 given with or without MnCC-CRM197 showed no interfer- 
ence with meningococcal, diphtheria or pneumococcal responses 
when the vaccines were given together compared with separate 
administration.21 
Immune responses to diphtheria and tetanus antigens were spe- 
cifically assessed in this study to evaluate the potential for interference 
arising from the genetically modified diphtheria toxin CRM197 and the 
tetanus toxoid conjugate proteins in the pneumococcal and meningo- 
coccal conjugate vaccines, respectively. The conjugate proteins had 
no differential impact on immune responses to the relevant antigens 
included in the DTaP vaccines, consistent with previous studies with 
PCV13.8,17–20 In addition, other studies have shown no interference with 
antigens included in the DTaP–HBV–IPV/Hib vaccine after vaccination 
with PCVs such as PCV7,22,23 or a 10-valent PCV that uses nontype- 
able Haemophilus influenzae protein D, tetanus toxoid and diphtheria 
toxoid carrier proteins (Synflorix; GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals).24 In 
contrast, interference with an Hib tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine was 
observed when it was coadministered with an experimental combina- 
tion 9-valent pneumococcal meningococcal C–CRM197 conjugate vac- 
cine.25 This indicates the potential for interference with coadministra- 
tion of polysaccharide protein conjugate vaccines, despite a difference 
in carriers. 
Immune responses to PCV13 were substantial after the infant 
series and the toddler dose. After dose 2, the proportion of respond- 
ers was lower for serotypes 6B (27.9%) and 23F (55.8%) than for 
the other 11 serotypes (73.8–100%), consistent with previous stud- 
ies of PCV726–28 and PCV13.8,18,20 The proportion of responders 
increased notably after the third infant dose and after the toddler 
dose. Previous studies of the immunogenicity of PCV13 in children 
receiving concomitant routine childhood vaccinations have shown 
similar results.6–8,18,29,30 Thus, the majority of infants may have 






 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


protection against vaccine-serotype pneumococcal disease after a 
2-dose infant PCV13 series for most serotypes, but completion of 
a 3-dose series followed by a toddler dose maximizes the immune 
response. Consistent with the clinical experience of PCV7, a booster 
dose of PCV13 between ages 11 and 15 months induces a substan- 
tial enhancement of the immune response against serotypes 6B and 
23F. It can be anticipated that PCV13 will be as effective as PCV7 
when given in a 2 + 1 schedule. This conclusion is based on the com- 
parable vaccine response patterns seen between recipients of PCV13 
and PCV7, and on the high levels of effectiveness of PCV7 against 
vaccine serotype disease, including serotypes 6B and 23F, following 
PCV7 introduction in England and Wales31,32 and other countries or 
regions that have adopted a 2 + 1 schedule (eg, Norway, Quebec, 
the Liguria region of Italy).33–35 In addition, a study in England and 
Wales 1 year after the introduction of PCV13 reported a 50% reduc- 
tion of IPD caused by the 6 additional serotypes in PCV13 (includ- 
ing serotypes 3 and 6A), demonstrating the effectiveness of PCV13 
in reducing incidence of IPD caused by the 6 additional serotypes.36 
In countries in which the recommended schedule is 2 infant doses 
followed by a toddler dose (ie, a 2 + 1 schedule), a national pediatric 
immunization program with high levels of uptake and adherence to 
vaccine schedules will be important to ensure protection, and active 
surveillance should continue to be conducted to monitor disease 
caused by serotypes 3, 6A, 6B and 23F. 
PCV13 and PCV7 were well tolerated, and no new safety 
concerns were identified. Safety outcomes were in general similar 
between groups, with the exception that irritability after the toddler 
dose and AEs during the infant series occurred at higher frequen- 
cies in the PCV7 group compared with the PCV13 group. Most AEs 
were conditions and symptoms commonly expected for children in 
this age group, and with the exception of rash, AE categories gener- 
ally showed no clear trends for differences between groups. 
After the introduction of PCV7 in Spain in 2001, incidence 
of IPD caused by PCV7 serotypes decreased concurrently with an 
increase in incidence of disease caused by non-PCV7 serotypes, 
with most of this increase caused by the 6 additional serotypes in 
PCV13.4,37,38 PCV13 covers approximately 78–87% of IPD in chil- 
dren aged 5 years in Spain,4 similar to the worldwide estimate of 
80–92% reported by the Global Serotypes Project.5 The immuno- 
genicity data from the present study are promising and reassuring 
but active surveillance of disease incidence and serotypes will con- 
tinue to be needed, and correlation of immune response and clinical 
efficacy for each serotype will need to be ascertained. 
A limitation to this study was that immune responses for the 
PCV7 serotypes were not measured in the subjects who received 
PCV7, and thus noninferiority of PCV13 as compared with PCV7 
for these serotypes could not be evaluated. In previous studies, 
IgG antibody responses to PCV13 have been demonstrated to be 
noninferior as compared with PCV7 when administered in a 3 + 
16,7 or 2 + 1 schedule.8 In addition, functional opsonophagocytic 
activity (OPA) responses were not obtained in this study. In other 
studies, OPA responses for the 7 common serotypes were nonin- 
ferior for PCV13 compared with PCV7, and OPA responses to 
the 6 additional serotypes were substantial after the infant series 
and toddler dose of PCV13 administered in a 3 + 16,7,29 or 2 + 1 
schedule.8,20 
In conclusion, immune responses to MnCC-TT and other rou- 
tine childhood vaccines (DTaP–HBV–IPV/Hib and DTaP–-IPV+Hib) 
were noninferior when concomitantly administered with PCV13 
compared with PCV7. PCV13 does not interfere with MnCC-TT or 
other routine childhood vaccines. PCV13 produces a strong immune 
response against all vaccine serotypes with a favorable safety profile 
in both infants and toddlers. PCV13 can be given safely at ages 2, 
4 and 6 months (infant series) and 15 months (toddler dose) with 
concomitant MnCC-TT, DTaP–HBV–IPV/Hib and DTaP–IPV+Hib.
