The WHO declaration of a global influenza pandemic due to a 
novel strain of A/H1N1 (A/California/7/2009) virus has led to a 
massive effort by health authorities and vaccine manufacturers to 
develop effective vaccines against the new virus. The virus itself 
has spread rapidly to affect all of the world’s nations, with similar 
epidemiology across the globe. The latest estimates at the time of 
this report are of millions of infections, estimates which suffer 
from severe under-reporting as the disease has proven to be mild 
in the majority of cases, but with over 16,800 deaths directly 
attributable to the virus.1 
Vaccine manufacturers have responded to this new pandemic by 
developing A/H1N1v vaccines based on the A/California/7/2009 
H1N1 viral strain supplied by the United States Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC). Many different 
formulations have been produced, with a range of antigen doses, 
with and without adjuvants, and with different production 
techniques such as traditional egg-based viral culture or new 
cell culture techniques. Experience with avian influenza H5N1 
prepandemic vaccines had suggested that at least two doses of 
adjuvanted or high antigen dose vaccine would be necessary 
to provide immunologic protection against the novel virus.2,3 
However, initial results with early A/H1N1v vaccines suggested 
that in non-elderly adults one dose would be sufficient.4,5 
Because global production capacity had been predicted to fall 
well short of the anticipated supply requirements, health authori- 
ties have been forced to prioritize vaccine use to those at most 
risk of serious consequences from infection with the new virus. 
However, in addition to the classical high-risk groups for any 
influenza infection—those with underlying diseases, pregnant 
women and the immunocompromised—the main age groups 



Methods: an open-label phase III study of immunogenicity and safety of novel a/H1N1v vaccines included 392 costa 
Rican children in two pediatric cohorts (3–8 and 9–17 years). They received two doses, of either an MF59®-adjuvanted for- 
mulation containing 7.5 μg antigen or non-adjuvanted formulations containing 15 or 30 μg antigen, three weeks apart. 
Immunogenicity was assessed as hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers using the cBeR licensure criteria.

Background: The recent global a/H1N1v pandemic led to major efforts to develop effective vaccines against the novel 
virus, while global demand and limited production capacity focused attention on dose sparing and schedules. 
Results: all three vaccines elicited immune responses in 9–17-year-olds meeting cBeR criteria three weeks after one 
dose; responses were not enhanced by second dose. In 3–8-year-olds only the adjuvanted vaccine met the cBeR crite- 
ria after one dose, but all three vaccines met the criteria criteria after second dose. all vaccines were well tolerated; no 
related serious adverse events (sae) and few severe solicited reactions were reported. MF59-adjuvanted vaccine was 
associated with more reports of injection site pain and tenderness and overall systemic solicited reactions, most notably 
in older subjects, all of which decreased after the second dose. 
conclusion: One dose of non-adjuvanted a/H1N1v vaccine is adequate in 9–17-year-olds, but younger children require 
either one dose of MF59-adjuvanted vaccine or two doses of non-adjuvanted vaccine to achieve protective titers. en- 
hanced immunogenicity with MF59 is associated with a small increase in reactogenicity, but no safety issues. 




proportion of males in the 9–17-year-olds who received the 
adjuvanted formulation (Table 1). Few (4–6%) of the subjects 
reported any history of seasonal influenza vaccination. There 
were small numbers of subjects who withdrew from the study 
prior to receiving the first vaccination largely due to abnormal 
baseline laboratory assessments (0–4% across the study groups). 
All subjects who received a vaccination were included in the safety 
analysis. Between 9% and 19% of subjects per study group, were 
excluded from the final immunogenicity analysis due to protocol 
deviations (Fig. 1), principally due to study assessments being 
performed outside the protocol-specified timeframe. 
Immunogenicity. Prior to vaccination, there was an increase 
in seropositivity with increasing age, as assessed by A/H1N1 
titer ≥10, from 20% in 3-year-olds to 43.8% in 13–17-year-olds 
(Fig. 1). Of the 3–8 and 9–17 years cohorts, respectively, 26.6% 
and 39.1% had titers ≥10, while 23.7% and 33.9% had titers 
≥40, a titer associated with protection against seasonal influenza 
strains.7 The proportions of seropositive subjects at baseline were 
in similar in all vaccine groups. 
Three weeks after a single vaccination, antibody responses to 
A/H1N1v were robust in all three vaccine groups and in both 
age cohorts. However, in the 3–8-year-olds, only the adjuvanted 
vaccine demonstrated HI antibody responses that met all CBER 
and CHMP criteria. In this age group the two non-adjuvanted 
vaccines met all three CHMP criteria, but failed to meet the 
more stringent CBER criterion for an HI titer ≥40 (Fig. 2). In 
the 9–17-year-olds, HI antibody responses were sufficient to meet 
both CBER criteria and all three CHMP criteria in all three vac- 
cine groups (adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted). One week after the 
second vaccination, all vaccine groups in both age cohorts met all 
CBER and CHMP criteria and continued to meet these criteria 
through to day 43, three weeks after the second vaccination. 
Immune responses in 3–8-year-olds. GMT responses 
assessed 21 days after the first vaccination were greatest in the 
7.5 μg-adjuvanted group in which the GMT (386) was three 
impacted by the infection are healthy children and young adults, 
which imposed further strain on healthcare resources due to the 
large size of this age cohort.6 
As part of the development of an egg-based A/H1N1v vac- 
cine based on the commercial seasonal influenza subunit vaccine, 
Fluvirin® (Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Liverpool, UK), 
we studied the immune responses and safety profile of three dif- 
ferent A/H1N1v formulations given in two doses to discrete age 
cohorts from 3 to 64 years of age. In this report we focus on the 
data obtained in the target population of children and adoles- 
cents up to 17 years of age. 

Overall 392 children were enrolled, 196 in each of the two age 
cohorts. Over 99% of the study population was Hispanic, with 
similar distribution of gender and mean ages in three groups 
in each of the two age cohorts, with the exception of a higher

times higher than that achieved when 15 μg (126) was given 
without adjuvant and over twice the response to 30 μg (161) 
without adjuvant (Table 2). The respective GMRs (31, 12 and 
13) in all three vaccine groups met and exceeded the CHMP 
criterion of 2.5 (Table 3). 
When measured seven days after the second vaccination, two- 
to six-fold increases were observed in all groups as compared with 
3 weeks after first vaccination. GMTs increased to 2,105, 353 and 
530 in the 7.5 μg-adjuvanted, and 15 and 30 μg non-adjuvanted 
groups, respectively. These levels had declined slightly two weeks 
later, at six weeks, but the marked elevation of titer observed with 
the adjuvanted vaccine persisted, with GMTs of 1,488, 227 and 
453, respectively. 
At all three time-points after first (i.e., Day 22) and after 
second (i.e., Day 29 and Day 43) study vaccinations, HI titer 
≥40 was demonstrated in >70% of subjects in the 3 to 8 year 
age cohort but the lower limit of the 95% confidence inter- 
val extended below this margin in the non-adjuvanted vaccine 
groups at Day 22 (Fig. 2). At all three time-points, seroconver- 
sion was demonstrated in >40% of subjects in this age cohort and 
the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval also exceeded this 
threshold (Table 3). 
At Day 22 (3 weeks after a single study vaccination) the 
7.5 μg-adjuvanted group met all CBER and CHMP criteria. 
However, while both non-adjuvanted vaccine groups met the 
CHMP criteria, the more stringent CBER criterion of 70% 
achieving an HI titer ≥40 was not met by either unadjuvanted 
group as the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval fell below 
the 70% value (Fig. 2). At one and three weeks, after the second 
study vaccination (Days 29 and 43, respectively) all CBER and 
CHMP criteria were met by all three vaccine groups (Table 3 
and Fig. 2). 
When these responses were examined separately according to 
baseline A/H1N1v serostatus, HI titer responses to vaccination 
were lower in initially seronegative (HI <10) subjects, than in 
initially seropositive (HI ≥10) subjects, particularly for the non- 
adjuvanted vaccines. Thus, with the adjuvanted vaccine Day 22 
and Day 43 GMTs were 198 and 1487, respectively, in initially 
seronegative subjects (n = 37), and 1774 and 1569, respectively, 
in initially seropositive subjects (n = 17). In initially seronegative 
subjects given the 15 and 30 μg non-adjuvanted vaccines (n = 
60 and 40, respectively) the respective GMTs were 54 and 67 
at Day 22 and 131 and 251 at Day 43. The GMTs in initially 
seropositive subjects were 2073 and 1539 at Day 22, and 1429 
and 1341 at Day 43. These quantitative differences in response 
were reflected in the qualitative responses—100% subjects who 
were initially seropositive had titers ≥40 at Day 43 irrespective 
of the vaccine given, and 100% of seronegative subjects who 
received the adjuvanted vaccine achieved this level. However, of 
initially seronegative 3–8-year-olds who received the 15 and 30 
μg non-adjuvanted vaccines only 80% and 92%, respectively, 
had achieved the titer level considered seroprotective at Day 43. 
Immune responses in 9–17-year-olds. GMT responses were 
higher in the 7.5 μg-adjuvanted group 21 days after a single dose 
of vaccine (1300) compared with 881 and 1143 after a single dose 
of 15 μg or 30 μg non-adjuvanted vaccines, respectively. When 
measured seven days after second study vaccination, antibody 
titers continued to rise but less markedly than in the younger 
age group. GMTs had increased to 1925, 1146 and 1368, but fell 
to 1341, 798 and 1027, three weeks after second study vaccina- 
tion in the 7.5 μg adjuvanted, 15 μg non-adjuvanted, and 30 μg 
non-adjuvanted groups, respectively. One dose of either vaccine 
was sufficient to achieve the CBER and CHMP criteria in this 
age cohort (Tables 2 and 3), with 100%, 96% and 100% having 
titers ≥40 at three weeks following the first vaccination in the 
7.5 μg-adjuvanted, and 15 and 30 μg non-adjuvanted groups, 
respectively (Fig. 2). 
When these responses were examined separately accord- 
ing to initial serostatus to A/H1N1 (HI ≥10 or <10), lower HI 
responses to vaccination were observed in initially seronegative 
subjects, although the differences were of a lesser magnitude 
than in the younger subjects. In seronegative subjects given the 
non-adjuvanted 15 and 30 μg vaccines, respective GMTs were 
569 and 966 at Day 22 and 622 and 848 at Day 43 compared 
with 1980 and 1496 at Day 22, and 1264 and 1396 at Day 43 
in initially seropositive subjects. For the adjuvanted vaccine, 
GMTs at Day 22 were 795 and 2281 in seronegative and sero- 
positive 9–17-year-olds, respectively, and 1046 and 1781 at Day 
43. All initially seropositive subjects had already achieved an HI 
titer ≥40 after one vaccination, and the higher overall responses 
in this older age group meant that despite the lower response in

the initially seronegative subjects, 95% –100% had HI titers ≥40 
after one dose, and all but one subject (in the 15 μg non-adju- 
vanted group) achieved this level by Day 43. 
Safety. Overall there were five subjects who were not evalu- 
ated for safety as they did not receive any vaccination, three in 
the 3–8-year-olds and two in the 9–17-year-olds. Ten subjects 
who received the wrong vaccine according to the randomization 
were assessed according to the actual vaccine received. There 
was only one SAE, a case of appendicitis in a 16-year-old male 
eight days after receiving the first dose of 15 μg vaccine, which 
was considered unrelated to the vaccination. All three vaccine 
formulations demonstrated an acceptable reactogenicity profile 
in both age cohorts. 
Local reactions. There were no reports of severe (Grade 3 
or 4) local reactions in either age cohort or any of the vaccine 
groups. In 3–8-year-olds slightly more adjuvanted vaccine recipi- 
ents (45%) reported any local reaction after the first vaccination 
than either 15 μg or 30 μg recipients (both 37%), but reported 
rates of local reactions were similar after the second vaccination 
(36%, 35% and 39%, respectively). Increased local reactogenic- 
ity to adjuvant was more evident in the 9–17-years-olds after the 
first (70%, 43% and 51%) and second (60%, 43% and 49%) 
vaccinations. 
The most commonly reported local reactions in both age 
cohorts were of mild/moderate injection site pain and tenderness 
(Table 4). Both age groups displayed a modestly higher fre- 
quency of subjects reporting injection site pain and tenderness in 
the adjuvanted vaccine group, but in all three groups these reac- 
tions generally decreased after the second vaccination. 
For local reactions with objective measurements (injection 
site induration, erythema and swelling), there was a modest 
increase in the percentages of subjects presenting these reac- 
tions in the adjuvanted vaccine group compared with the non- 
adjuvanted vaccine groups in 3–8-year-old children, but no 
noteworthy differences between vaccine groups in 9–17-year- 
olds. Across both age cohorts, the severity of these reactions 
was mild to moderate with no subject described as having severe 
(grade 3) or potentially life threatening (grade 4) reactions fol- 
lowing vaccination. There were small increases in the number 
of 3–8-year-old subjects reporting swelling and induration after 
the second vaccination of adjuvanted vaccine compared with 
non-adjuvanted vaccines, but this trend was not observed in 
9–17-year-olds (Table 4). 
Systemic reactions. As with local reactions, there were slightly 
more systemic reactions in the 3–8-year-olds given MF59®- 
adjuvanted vaccine (45%) than non-adjuvanted vaccine (33% 
and 31%) after the first vaccination, but this trend was no longer 
observed after the second vaccination (24%, 27% and 33%). In 
the 9–17-year-olds 7.5 μg-adjuvanted and 15 μg non-adjuvanted 
vaccines were associated with similar rates of systemic reactions

each age group over the 42 day study period 
to moderate, with nine subjects reporting reactions described as 
severe, but no subjects reporting reactions described as poten- 
tially life threatening (grade 4). The subjects reporting severe 
adverse events were randomly distributed across vaccine groups, 
age cohorts and first and second vaccinations (Table 5). 
Unsolicited reactions. Unsolicited adverse events were reported 
in a few subjects in both the 3–8-year-old and the 9–17-year-old 
age groups (Table 6). The most frequently reported event in both 
age groups was nasopharyngitis. All unsolicited adverse events 
were described as mild to moderate in severity. 
Safety laboratory assessments. No subject in the 3–8- and 
9–17-year old age cohorts experienced Grade 2 or higher level 
toxicity laboratory abnormalities at any point after study vaccina- 
tion. The laboratory parameters included in this testing were ala- 
nine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, haemoglobin, 
white blood cell count, platelets and creatinine. 

The recent global pandemic of A/H1N1 (A/California/7/2009) 
influenza1 has resulted in a massive public health demand for 
novel vaccines, leading to a major development investment by 
all vaccine manufacturers. Initial concerns over limited antigen 
availability and low immune responses in naïve populations led 
to the belief that a two dose regimen would be a prerequisite of 
a successful public health strategy. These concerns were based 
on experience with other novel influenza viruses such as avian 
influenza (H5N1) vaccines,2,3 which indicated that either a high 
antigen content or adjuvantation with novel oil-in-water adju- 
vants would provide adequate immunity. The global demand 
and necessity for dose-sparing is also an argument for the use 
of adjuvants to ensure as wide a distribution as possible for the 
limited vaccine supply. 
The results of this report were a part of a larger study involving 
subjects from 3 to 64 years of age in Costa Rica investigating the 
alternatives of using either the oil-in-water adjuvant, MF59, (as 
used in the European commercial seasonal vaccine, Fluad) with a 
lower antigen dose 7.5 μg, or administering a higher dose (30 μg) 
than the typical 15 μg dose used in seasonal influenza vaccines. 
We have focused this report on the two younger age cohorts (3–8 
and 9–17 years of age) as the under-18 population is the one most 
at risk of serious consequences of H1N1 infection, with 45% of 
hospitalizations occurring in this age group in the United States.6 
A brief report of the preliminary first dose data from these groups 
has been already been made,8 and a full report of the one year 
safety data will be made when the study completes. 
The baseline data of our study illustrates the presence of anti- 
bodies to A/H1N1 in several of our pediatric subjects despite 
the absence of known influenza illness within the six months. In 
most of these subjects who were seropositive, HI titers exceeded 
HI titer ≥40, a level associated with protection against seasonal 
and A/H1N1 influenza.7 A possible explanation would be that 
these children may have experienced subclinical infection prior 
to study participation. 
After one vaccination there was an age-dependent difference 
in response between the younger and older pediatric cohorts. 
Older subjects responded to a single dose of study vaccine and 
achieved antibody responses meeting criteria for licensure (CBER 
and CHMP) irrespective of baseline seropositivity status and also 
irrespective of the addition of MF59 adjuvant. However, in the 
younger pediatric subjects, responses to vaccination were generally 
weaker in those subjects assigned to receive non-adjuvanted vac- 
cine. Even doubling the antigen dose of non-adjuvanted vaccine 
from 15 to 30 μg did not produce HI antibody titers that met cri- 
teria for licensure in these groups after a single dose. In contrast, 
response to a single dose of MF59-adjuvanted vaccine led to high 
rates of seroconversion (91%) and HI titer ≥40 (93%), meeting 
the CBER and CHMP requirements. Other published studies 
on A/H1N1v vaccination in the same age groups with unadju- 
vanted vaccines have shown similar results. A Chinese study of an 
unadjuvanted vaccine containing 30 μg antigen found 52–57% 
of 3–9-year-olds had HI titers ≥40 three weeks after receiving 
one dose, compared with 90% of 10–17-year-olds.9 In 3–9-year- 
old US children, one dose of 24 or 50 μg unadjuvanted antigen 
elicited HI titers ≥40 in 69% and 75% of subjects, respectively, 
21 days later.10 
In addition to enhancing responses to first vaccination in chil- 
dren, MF59 adjuvant-containing vaccines demonstrated a greater 
magnitude of response after a second vaccination as compared 
with non-adjuvanted vaccines, particularly in children who were 
seronegative at baseline in both age cohorts. These data are con- 
sistent with other observations suggesting that in adolescents and 
adults one A/H1N1 vaccination is adequate to confer protection 
against infection, but younger children require either higher 
doses of non-adjuvanted vaccine or an adjuvanted vaccine.4,5,11 
MF59 adjuvant is included in an influenza vaccine licensed 
for use in Europe in elderly subjects, Fluad, of which over 47 mil- 
lion doses have been distributed. MF59 has also been included 
in influenza vaccines administered to children in clinical studies

and almost 1,200 subjects have been exposed (Novartis Vaccines, 
data on file). Study data collected to date indicate that MF59 pro- 
motes a robust antibody response to seasonal influenza antigens 
in a pediatric population with minimal increase in local and sys- 
temic reactogenicity and no other changes in safety profile when 
compared with non-adjuvanted comparator vaccines.12 Further 
proof of the MF59 safety in children and adolescents comes 
from pre-licensure trials and post-marketing experience with 
other H1N1 adjuvanted vaccines based on an egg-based platform 
and distributed mainly in Europe (Focetria®),5,13 as well as from 
H1N1 adjuvanted vaccines made using cell culture (Celtura®) 
and distributed mainly in Japan, Europe and Latin America.14 
In the present study both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vac- 
cines were well tolerated, with no vaccine-related SAEs and few 
severe adverse events. MF59 has been associated with increased 
injection site soreness,12,15 and this was confirmed in this study, 
but the character of pain generally remained mild to moderate in 
severity. In general, reaction rates to the second vaccination were 
lower than to the first although there were increases in rates of 
erythema, induration and swelling with the adjuvanted vaccine 
in 3–8-year-olds. Systemic reactions were more frequent in the 
older subjects, but most were mild or moderate and similar to the 
profile of seasonal influenza vaccines. These reactions were also 
less frequent after the second vaccination compared with the first. 
These data confirm that novel A/H1N1 vaccines are well tol- 
erated and immunogenic in children from 3 to 17 years of age. 
Non-adjuvanted vaccines were sufficiently immunogenic in older 
subjects to allow a one dose schedule to be used, but subjects from 
3 to 8 years would require two doses of non-adjuvanted vaccine 
to achieve the require degree of immunity. Use of the commercial 
adjuvant MF59, generated a larger immune response in both age 
groups, such that one dose was sufficient from 3 to 17 years, while 
also decreasing the dose of antigen from 15 μg to 7.5 μg, thereby 
potentially allowing dose-sparing and provision of more vaccine. 
The theoretical four-fold increase in available vaccine doses if 
using one dose of 7.5 μg adjuvanted with MF59 rather than two 
doses of 15 μg is an important consideration for social equality 
in view of the global limited manufacturing capacity. The rapid 
immune responses with the lower antigen dose also facilitates 
rapid immunization of young children, the group at greatest risk 
for severe illness leading to hospitalization at the beginning of a 
pandemic, and could be an important factor given the rapidity 
with which the current A/H1N1 pandemic spread globally. 

This was a single-center, randomized, open label, phase III 
study performed in the Instituto de Atención Pediátrica, San 
José, Costa Rica, with enrollment from 18–30th August, 2009. 
Participants were healthy subjects of both genders from 3 to 
64 years of age, enrolled into one of three age cohorts (3 to 
<9, 9 to 17 and 18 to 64 years of age). This report includes 
the data from only those subjects from 3 to 17 years of age. 
The study was designed and implemented in accordance with 
the ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with appli- 
cable local regulations which also met those of the European 
Directive 2001/20/EC, US Code of Federal Regulations Title 
21, and Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, and 
the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Ethical Committee approval of the Universidad de Ciencias 
Médicas, San José, Costa Rica was obtained before study initia- 
tion. ClinTrials No. NCT00973700. 
Subjects. Eligible subjects for this subset of the study popula- 
tion were healthy children, at least 3 years of age and less than 
18 years of age at study enrollment, who had not previously 
received an H1N1 vaccine. Parents or legal guardians provided 
written informed consent and all subjects 10 years of age or older 
provided informed assent once they had the aims of the study 
explained to them. Exclusion criteria included any known ill- 
ness or innate condition which might interfere with the results 
of the study or put the participant at additional risk, including 
any history of anaphylaxis, serious adverse reactions or hyper- 
sensitivity to influenza vaccine components, serious disease or 
underlying medical condition, or previous laboratory-confirmed 
or suspected influenza disease within six months of enrollment. 
Females of child-bearing potential were required to have a nega- 
tive pregnancy test and to have practiced acceptable contracep- 
tive methods for two months prior to study entry and to continue 
to practice contraception through to three weeks after the last 
study vaccination. Intended enrollment was for 392 subjects in 
two equal age cohorts of 3 to <9 years and 9 to 17 years, with 
random assignment in 2:3:2 ratio to three vaccine groups using a 
randomization list supplied by the study sponsor. 
Vaccine and schedule. Three monovalent subunit influenza 
vaccine formulations were produced with A/H1N1v antigen 
(hemagglutinin) prepared by the egg-based viral cultivation 
procedure used to manufacture the US-licensed seasonal influ- 
enza vaccine, Fluvirin (Novartis Vaccines, Liverpool, UK). 
The seed virus was A/California/7/2009 supplied by the US 
Center for Diseases Control. The first formulation contained 
7.5 μg A/H1N1v antigen in each 0.5 mL dose with the same 
quantity of the MF59 oil-in-water antigen (Novartis Vaccines, 
Marburg, Germany) found in the European-licensed seasonal 
influenza vaccine, Fluad® (Novartis Vaccines, Siena, Italy). This 
dose of MF59 contains 9.75 mg squalene, 1.17 mg polysorbate 80 
(Tween 80) and 1.17 mg sorbitan triolate (Span 80). This formu- 
lation was supplied in prefilled, monodose syringes. The second 
and third formulations contained 15 μg and 30 μg A/H1N1v 
antigen in 0.5 mL, respectively, without adjuvant or excipients, 
supplied in prefilled, monodose vials. 
On Day 1, subjects in each age cohort were randomized to 
one of the three vaccine groups (2:3:2 distribution) and received 
their first vaccination by intramuscular injection in the deltoid: 
Group 1 received one dose of the 7.5 μg adjuvanted formulation, 
Group 2 one dose of the 15 μg non-adjuvanted formulation, and 
Group 3 a total dose of non-adjuvanted 30 μg, given as 0.25 mL 
in each arm. Three weeks later, on Day 22, each subject received 
the same vaccinations as received on Day 1. Subjects were to be 
followed for safety through one year after last study vaccination. 
The results of which will be reported separately. 
Safety assessment. Each subject was monitored after vaccina- 
tion and reactogenicity was then assessed using parent-completed

(for children under the age of 12 years) or subject-completed 
diaries, in which local reactions (erythema, induration, swell- 
ing, tenderness, pain at the injection site) and systemic reactions 
(headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting, 
diarrhea, fever) were solicited for seven days.16 Reactogenicity was 
evaluated in accordance with toxicity grading scales defined by 
CBER,17 which consist of toxicity grade 1 (mild), grade 2 (mod- 
erate), grade 3 (severe) and grade 4 (potentially life-threatening). 
In addition, spontaneous reports of adverse events (AE) were col- 
lected through Day 43 of the study, which represents follow up 
through 21 days after the second vaccine dose. Serious adverse 
events (SAEs), including AEs leading to hospitalization, were to 
be reported immediately to the study sponsor and surveillance for 
these events was to continue through one year after last study vac- 
cination. Severity of all spontaneously reported AEs was assessed 
as mild (no limitation of normal daily activity), moderate (some 
limitation of normal daily activity) or severe (unable to perform 
normal daily activity). The study investigator determined the 
relationship of spontaneously reported AEs to the vaccine as not 
related, possibly related or probably related. Safety laboratory 
assessments were performed at Day 1, 8 and 43 and were evalu- 
ated according to standardized toxicity grading scales defined by 
DAIDS,18 which consists of toxicity grade 1 (mild) through 4 
(potentially life threatening). 
Immunogenicity. A 5 mL blood sample for immunogenicity 
assessments was drawn from each subject before the vaccinations 
on Days 1 and 22, and on Days 29 and Day 43, and sera imme- 
diately prepared for storage and shipping at -20°C to the Novartis 
Clinical Serology Laboratory (Marburg, Germany). Immune 
responses to the A/H1N1v antigen were tested by homologous 
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Geometric mean titers 
(GMT) were calculated for each vaccine group at each time- 
point, as well as Geometric Mean Ratios (GMR) for titers at 
Days 22, 29 and 43 related to Day 1, and percentages of each 
group with HI titers ≥40. Seroconversion rates were calculated 
as the percentages of each group that displayed seroconversion 
in initially seronegative subjects (from HI <10 pre-vaccination 
to ≥40 post-vaccination) or a significant increase in titer in ini- 
tially seropositive subjects (a four-fold increase in titer in those 
≥10 pre-vaccination). 
Statistical analysis. There were no formal statistical hypoth- 
eses tested. Group sample sizes were based on estimations of per- 
centages of subjects with post-vaccination HI titer ≥40 and with 
seroconversion in HI titer to meet the US Center for Biologics 
Evaluation and Research (CBER) criteria for licensure of pan- 
demic influenza vaccines, for which the lower bound of the two- 
sided 95% confidence interval should meet or exceed 40% for 
seroconversion and 70% for those with HI titer ≥40. HI anti- 
body responses were also evaluated according to the European 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
licensing criteria for pandemic influenza vaccines,19 which evalu- 
ate vaccination responses according to whether or not the study 
groups demonstrate >70% subjects with a post vaccination HI 
titer ≥40, >40% of subjects demonstrating seroconversion or sig- 
nificant increase in HI titer, and post-vaccination GMR >2.5. 
These primary analyses were performed on the Per Protocol data- 
set, which excluded major protocol deviations, but analysis of the 
Full Analysis Set did not reveal any clinically or statistically sig- 
nificant differences.
