Young children are at increased risk for inﬂuenza infections and related complications. The protection 
offered to children by conventional trivalent inactivated inﬂuenza vaccines (TIV) is suboptimal, due 
to poor immunogenicity and a higher exposure to infection and complications in this age group, par- 
ticularly from inﬂuenza B strains. In this dose-ranging, factorial design trial, we report the safety and 
immunogenicity of different combinations of adjuvanted (ATIV) and non-adjuvanted trivalent (TIV) and 
quadrivalent (QIV) inﬂuenza vaccines in 480 healthy children 6 to <36 months of age. 
The results show that the second B strain added to TIV was immunogenic and did not affect immuno- 
genicity of the other strains. The addition of the MF59® adjuvant promoted robust immune responses with 
notable elevations in antibodies observed even after one dose. A dose–response relationship was observed 
between the antibody response and MF59 adjuvant. No patterns in safety and tolerability emerged with 
different adjuvant and antigen doses nor with the addition of a second B strain. MF59-adjuvanted QIV 
offers potential advantages to young children.

Inﬂuenza is associated with substantial morbidity in children 
[1,2], who also play a major role in the transmission and spread 
of inﬂuenza in households and the community during epidemics 
[3,4]. Vaccination of children against inﬂuenza brings important 
health beneﬁts, directly to the children themselves and indirectly 
to persons in other age groups, by helping to control the spread 
of inﬂuenza [5,6]. However, meta-analyses reveal that immune 
responses conferred by conventional, nonadjuvanted, trivalent 
inactivated inﬂuenza vaccines (TIVs) do not appear to effectively 
induce protective antibodies in young unprimed children, resulting 
in only modest efﬁcacy [7]. This trend appears particularly evident 
for the inﬂuenza B strain for which conventional nonadjuvanted 
vaccines generally exhibit lower immunogenicity to the B strain 
than to the inﬂuenza A antigens [8], although this may also be a

consequence of lower sensitivity for antibodies to the B strain in 
the standard test [9]. Immune responses in young children can, 
however, be effectively enhanced with the use of the oil-in-water 
emulsion adjuvant MF59® (Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics) [8]. 
Since the early 1980s, two antigenically dissimilar strains of 
inﬂuenza B virus have been present in the human population, 
one lineage represented by B/Victoria/2/87-like and the other 
by B/Yamagata/16/88-like viruses [10]. Notably, since 1988, both 
have simultaneously been associated with signiﬁcant numbers of 
infections in various locations worldwide [10,11]. A recent study 
demonstrated that inﬂuenza B infections accounted for approxi- 
mately one ﬁfth of all inﬂuenza-related hospitalizations in children 
under 16 years of age in Finland [12]. Moreover, proportionately 
more inﬂuenza B strain infections occur in children compared with 
older populations [13]. In 5 of the past 10 inﬂuenza seasons in the 
United States (2001–2010), the predominant circulating inﬂuenza 
B 
 virus lineage did not match the strain contained in the vac- 
cine [14]. Hence, as two inﬂuenza B virus lineages cocirculate, and 
there is little cross-protection between the two lineages [15,16], 
the protection offered by only one B virus lineage in each year’s TIV 
exposes children to insufﬁcient protection in case of a mismatch 
[17–19]. Recent observations of inﬂuenza trends demonstrate that 
 
 
 


in years in which the recommended inﬂuenza B strain in TIV is 
poorly matched to the circulating B strain, up to 29% of inﬂuenza 
cases in a population might be attributed to the circulation of the 
other inﬂuenza B strain which had not been included in the vaccine 
[20]. A potential strategy to cover this still unmet medical need is a 
quadrivalent formulation that includes a second B strain from the 
alternative lineage. 
The present study in healthy children 6 to <36 months of age is 
a 
 dose-ranging factorial design trial to evaluate the safety, tolera- 
bility and immunogenicity of different vaccine formulations with 
different doses of MF59 adjuvant and/or a second B strain (quadri- 
valent inﬂuenza vaccine [QIV]) when added to either high or low 
doses of a puriﬁed subunit inﬂuenza vaccine. 

This multicenter, randomized, observer-blind, dose-ranging, 
factorial design, clinical trial in healthy children aged 6 to <36 
months was performed in 10 study centers in Finland and 5 centers 
in Belgium. Data were collected between October 2008 and March 
2009. The study was undertaken in compliance with Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study 
protocol was approved by the National Ethics Committee of Finland 
and the individual ethics review committees of participating cen- 
ters in Belgium. Before enrollment, written informed consent was 
obtained from parents or legal guardians. 

Immunogenicity objectives of this study were (i) to evalu- 
ate whether a one-dose schedule of any formulation provides 
 similar immunogenicity to a two-dose schedule (two 0.25-mL 
a 
(cid:2)g TIV/QIV + 50% MF59] (ATIV) 
vaccinations of adjuvanted [7.5 
(cid:2)g TIV/QIV + 0% MF59] TIV formulations); 
and nonadjuvanted [7.5 
(ii) to evaluate the immunogenicity of the study vaccine for- 
mulations according to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) 
recommendations (CPMP/BWP/214/96); (iii) to determine whether 
the addition of a second inﬂuenza B strain to a TIV is immuno- 
genic against the second B strain and whether it affects the immune 
response against the ﬁrst inﬂuenza B strain or the A/H3N2 and 
A/H1N1 strains; (iv) to assess the dose–response relationship 
between the MF59 dose and strain-speciﬁc antibodies; (v) to com- 
pare the study vaccine formulations to an approved nonadjuvanted 
pediatric TIV (Vaxigrip®, Sanoﬁ Pasteur) and to the vaccine formu- 
lated with 7.5 (cid:2)g per antigen and 50% of the approved MF59 dose in 
elderly adults (ATIV). Safety and tolerability objectives were to eval- 
uate solicited local and systemic reactogenicity and spontaneously 
reported adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs). 


 total of 595 healthy subjects of 6 to <36 months of age were 
planned to be enrolled in this study. Ultimately, 410 subjects were 
randomized owing to the slower than expected recruitment, which 
was stopped close to the middle of the inﬂuenza season. The main 
exclusion criteria were any history or ongoing chronic illness likely 
to interfere with the results; any history or likelihood of anaphy- 
laxis or adverse reactions to vaccine components; any known or 
suspected impairment/alteration of the immune system (including 
use of immunosuppressive therapy, receipt of immunostimulants, 
blood, blood products, and/or plasma derivatives or any parenteral 
immunoglobulin preparation in the past 12 weeks before enroll- 
ment); and any history of progressive or severe neurologic disorder, 
nonfebrile seizures, clinically suspected development delay, or 
bleeding diathesis. Additional exclusion criteria were receipt of any 
other vaccine within 2 weeks (inactivated vaccines) or 4 weeks (live 
vaccines) before enrollment, of inﬂuenza vaccine or laboratory con- 
ﬁrmed inﬂuenza within 6 months before the enrollment visit, of any 
other investigational product within 90 days of enrollment, rectal 
≥38.5 ◦C, and/or any acute illness within 3 days before 
temperature 
enrollment visit, unwillingness to refuse participation in another 
clinical trial before study completion, or a surgery planned during 
the study period that would interfere with the study visit schedule. 


Subjects were randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to one of the 
17 study groups (A–Q) as listed in Table 1. The vaccine study 
groups included combinations of 7.5-(cid:2)g or 15-(cid:2)g doses of each 
TIV strain and 0%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, or 100% of the MF59 adjuvant 
dose approved in Europe for elderly adults (Fluad®, Novartis Vac- 
(cid:2)g 
cines and Diagnostics) and, for QIV, the addition of 7.5 
of a second inﬂuenza B strain. Group Q refers to the marketed pedi- 
atric TIV comparator, Vaxigrip. All participating children were to 
be followed up through Day 29 (study groups O and P) or Day 50 
(study groups A–N and Q). Subjects in groups A–N and Q were to 
receive two doses of the assigned study vaccine 4 weeks apart, on 
Days 1 and 29, whereas participants in study groups O and P with 
full-dose MF59 adjuvant were to receive one vaccination on Day 1 
only. Vaccines were to be administered intramuscularly, preferably 
in the deltoid muscle of the nondominant arm (children 24–35 mo 
of age) or the anterolateral aspect of the thigh (children <24 mo of 
age). Time points for immunogenicity assessments were on Day 1 
(prevaccination), Day 29 (4 wk after dose 1), and Day 50 (3 wk after 
dose 2). Blood samples of approximately 5 mL were obtained by 
venipuncture for immunogenicity analyses. Time points for safety 
assessments were Day 1 (prevaccination baseline to 30 min after 
vaccination), Day 8 (1 wk after dose 1), Day 29 (4 wk after dose 
1), Day 36 (1 wk after dose 2), and Day 50 (3 wk after dose 2). 
Solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were to be recorded 
on a diary card for 7 consecutive days following the ﬁrst and second 
vaccinations. All reports of spontaneous AEs and concomitant med- 
ications were to be collected throughout the entire study period and 
reported at the subsequent study visit. Any SAE was to be reported 
immediately to the study sponsor. 






inﬂuenza vaccines each contained 7.5mcg or 
15mcg of hemagglutinin antigen (HA) from each of the three 
World Health Organization 
inﬂuenza strains 
for the 2008–2009 
in the northern hemi- 
virus, 
sphere: 
inﬂuenza A/Brisbane/10/2007 (A/H3N2)-like virus, and inﬂuenza 
B/Florida/4/2006-like virus (of the inﬂuenza B/Yamagata lineage). 
Inﬂuenza B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like antigen virus (Victoria lin- 
eage) was selected as the second B strain at 7.5mcg or 15mcg 
dose. The MF59 adjuvant is an oil-in-water emulsion, ﬁrst licensed 
for use in seasonal inﬂuenza vaccines in 1997 and of which more 
than 50 million doses have been delivered in Europe. At the time 
of this publication, inﬂuenza vaccines including MF59 adjuvant 
have been administered to over 4100 children in clinical studies 
(Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, data on ﬁle). In these studies, 
the safety proﬁle of the adjuvanted vaccine was similar to one of 
the nonadjuvanted comparator inﬂuenza vaccines [21–23], except 
for increases in mostly mild and local reactogenicity. A standard 
dose of the adjuvant MF59, as used in one 0.5-mL dose of the 
commercially available seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine Fluad, contains 
9.75 mg squalene, 1.175 mg polysorbate 80, 1.175 mg sorbitan 
trioleate, 0.66 mg sodium citrate, 0.04 mg citric acid, and water for 
injection. Each TIV or QIV formulation contained one of the follow- 
ing four MF59 doses (as % of commercial ATIV for eldrely adults, 
Fluad@ Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics): 0% (non adjuvanted), 
25%, 50%, 100%. Vaccines were supplied in monodose, preﬁlled 
syringes ﬁlled with either approximately 0.5 mL or 0.25 mL of 
vaccine, depending on the vaccine formulation (Table 1). The 
vaccine formulations were prepared and administered by blinded 
study personnel, who otherwise did not participate in evaluation 
of the subjects during the study. 

Blood samples taken for immunologic assays were centrifuged, 
−18 ◦C or below until shipped to the Novar- 
and sera were stored at 
tis Vaccines Clinical Serology Laboratory in Marburg, Germany, for 
analysis. Antibody responses were measured by hemagglutination 
inhibition (HI), according to standard methods [24]. HI antibody 
responses on Days 1, 29, and 50 were expressed as geometric mean 
titer (GMT), geometric mean ratio (GMR) of the postvaccination to 
prevaccination titer (Day 29/Day 1 titer and Day 50/Day 1 titer); 
seroprotection rates were deﬁned as the percentage of subjects 
≥40, and seroconversion rates were deﬁned as the 
with HI titers 
percentage of subjects per group achieving at least a 4-fold increase 
in HI titer from a seropositive prevaccination titer (≥10) or a rise 
from <10 to 



Solicited local reactions reported via diary card included ecchy- 
mosis, erythema, induration, swelling, and tenderness at injection 
site; solicited systemic reactions included sleepiness, diarrhea, 
vomiting, 
in eating habits, shivering, and 
unusual crying. Other indicators of reactogenicity were body tem- 
perature (preferably rectal temperature measurement) and use of 
analgesics/antipyretic medication for vaccination-induced fever. 
Local and systemic reactions were graded for severity according 
to standardized scales, following the Center for Biologics Evalua- 
tion and Research (CBER) Guidance [25,26]. The severity of adverse 
reactions was categorized as none, mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 
2), severe (grade 3), or potentially life threatening (grade 4). 


Assuming log-normal distributed antibody titer, a minimum 
relevant difference of factor 2.5, a common standard deviation of 
0.45 for the log10 titer, a 1-sided experiment-wise error of 5%, an 
80% any-pair power, and a 9% dropout rate resulted in a total of 
595 subjects (n = 35 in each study group) [27]. As groups could be 
combined, detectable minimum relevant differences (80% marginal 
power; 2-sided alpha 5%) ranged between 1.64 (n = 70/group) and 
1.80 (n = 70/group) when using t tests and the same assumptions 
as above. Population characteristics were summarized per vaccine 
group. 

Immunogenicity analyses were run on the per-protocol set 
(PPS), whereas safety was analyzed for all subjects exposed. 
Log10-transformed antibody titers were modeled using analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) for each strain and time point separately. 
Vaccine groups were included as qualitative factor, and strain- 
speciﬁc prevaccination titers served as covariate. Point estimates 
(geometric means, ratio of geometric means), their 2-sided 95% 
conﬁdence intervals, and p values for testing noninferiority and 
superiority hypotheses were derived from the models. Nonin- 
feriority and superiority margins of 0.67 and 1.00, respectively, 
were prespeciﬁed, and signiﬁcance was declared if the 1-sided p 
value was below 0.025. For the analysis of differences, a 2-sided 





 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 














p 
 value less than 0.05 was required. Immunogenicity data were 
also analyzed based on HI licensure criteria according to EMEA rec- 
ommendations (CPMP/BWP/214/96) [28]. There are no criteria for 
immunogenicity in children established by EMEA; the closest stan- 
dards are those used for an adult population. For the analyses of the 
TIV strains, vaccine groups were combined (pooled by MF59 doses 
and across identical TIV antigen levels) after having demonstrated 
that the second B strain had no impact on the antibody response 
of the TIV strains. A similar pooling was done for the analysis of 
the second B strain as the TIV antigen levels had no impact on the 
antibody response to the second B strain. The dose–response rela- 
tionship was modeled using two approaches: (1) linear regression 
analysis with log10-transformed titer as dependent and MF59 dose 
as independent quantitative variable and by means of a (2) prevac- 
cination titer adjusted ANCOVA with 3 pooled vaccine groups, each 
consisting of both TIV and both QIV formulations, for 0%, 25%, and 
50% MF59 doses. MF59 doses of 12.5% and 100% could not be used 
because they were either employed in only one TIV and one QIV 
formulation or only one vaccination was given. 






 total of 410 healthy children 6 to <36 months old were enrolled 
in the study. All subjects were vaccinated: 395 (96%) subjects 
were included for immunogenicity analyses (PPS) at baseline, 322 
(79%) subjects were included at Day 29, and 282 (77.9% of enrolled 
subjects that were to receive second vaccination) subjects were 
included at Day 50. All subjects were evaluated for safety. Sub- 
jects were predominantly white, mean age ranged from 14.2 to 
20 months across study groups, and boys and girls were evenly 
distributed in most groups (Table 2). There were no noteworthy dif- 
ferences in weight and height. A total of 11 children (2.7% of overall 
population) had previously received an inﬂuenza vaccination, and 
all participants met the entry criteria. 

Prevaccination, there were low levels of antibodies against the 
four vaccine strains in the 395 subjects tested, with 14.7%, 10.6%, 
≥10 against the H1N1, H3N2, B Florida 
10.4% and 1.0% having titers 
and B Malaysia strains, respectively. 
(i) In the assessment of whether a one-dose schedule of any for- 
mulation provides similar immunogenicity to two 0.25-mL 
(cid:2)g TIV/QIV + 50% MF59) or non- 
vaccinations of adjuvanted (7.5 
(cid:2)g TIV/QIV) formulations, it was found that no 
adjuvanted (7.5 
formulation was noninferior after one vaccination compared 
(cid:2)g 
with two vaccinations of the adjuvanted comparator (7.5 
TIV/QIV + 50% MF59). Vice versa, all adjuvanted formulations 
were noninferior after one vaccination compared with two vac- 
(cid:2)g TIV/QIV) 
cinations of the nonadjuvanted comparator (7.5 
for the H1N1 and H3N2 strains. For the ﬁrst B strain, only the 
adjuvanted formulations with either 50% or 100% MF59 were 
noninferior after one vaccination, and for the second B strain, 
(cid:2)g + 100% MF59 were noninferior after one vaccination 
only 15 
compared with two vaccinations of the nonadjuvanted com- 
parator (7.5 

(ii) Evaluation of GMRs, seroprotection, and seroconversion rates 
according to Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(CHMP) criteria across vaccine groups and virus strains are pre- 
sented in Table 3 (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, ﬁrst B strain, second B 
strain). On Day 29, 4 weeks after the ﬁrst vaccination, strong 
immune responses for the A strains were evident for the adju- 
vanted formulations, and all three CHMP criteria were met for 
all the adjuvanted vaccine groups. For the ﬁrst B strain (Florida), 
(cid:2)g TIV/QIV formulated with a half or full MF59 dose met 
only 15 
any of the criteria (GMR) after the ﬁrst vaccination. After two 
vaccinations, all three CHMP criteria were met for the three TIV 
strains by all adjuvanted formulations. None of the nonadju- 
(cid:2)g TIV/QIV or the licensed 
vanted formulations – 7.5 and 15 
(cid:2)g TIV) – met all CHMP cri- 
pediatric comparator Vaxigrip (7.5 
teria after either ﬁrst or second vaccination. For the second B 
strain (Malaysia), after one vaccination none of the QIV formu- 
lations met any CHMP criterion; after the second vaccination, 
all adjuvanted QIV formulations met all CHMP criteria, whereas 
none of the nonadjuvanted QIV formulation met any CHMP 
criterion. 
(iii) As expected, antibody responses to the second inﬂuenza B 
strains were greater in children who were vaccinated with 
QIV rather than TIV strains. The addition of the B/Malaysia 
strain to TIV did not signiﬁcantly impact (p > 0.05 for all strains 
and visits) the antibody responses against A/H1N1, A/H3N2, or 
B/Florida strains. GMT ratios of pooled QIV to pooled TIV anti- 
gen groups for Day 29 and Day 50 were in the following ranges: 
0.99–1.23 for A/H1N1, 0.71–0.83 for A/H3N2, and 0.85–1.07 for 
B/Florida. 

(iv) Linear regression analyses showed signiﬁcant increases in anti- 
body response with increasing MF59 dose for all four inﬂuenza 
(cid:2)g) and 
strains. The slopes and corresponding CI for lower (7.5 
higher (15 (cid:2)g) antigen doses are speciﬁed in terms of factors. 
Increasing the MF59 content from 0% to 100% translates for 
(cid:2)g) antigen dose, respectively, 
lower (7.5 
into an increase in antibody titer (95% CI) of 33.1 (9.3–117.5) 
and 117.5 (38–363.1) for A/H1N1, 30.2 (9.3–97.7), and 93.3 
(32.4–269.2) for H3N2, 20.4 (8.1–52.5), and 91.2 (37–229.1) 
for ﬁrst B strain, and 26.9 (6.8–114.8) and 52.5 (14.8–186.2) 
for second B strain, respectively. The slopes measured at the 
higher antigen dose were consistently greater than those mea- 
sured at the lower antigen dose, suggesting that increasing 
antigen dose in combination with increasing MF59 dose is 
associated with higher antibody responses to these inﬂuenza 
strains. 
All low-and high-antigen dose levels for 0%, 25%, and 50% 
MF59 doses were pooled to increase sample size. Pooling anal- 
yses could not be performed for the remaining two MF59 doses, 
12.5% and 100%, because these had either only low or only 
high antigen dose. Substantially increased GMTs are evident 
for pooled 25% MF59 dose groups compared with nonadju- 
vanted pooled groups, as shown by a 5- to 7-fold increase in 
GMTs at Day 50 for all virus strains (Fig. 1A–D). When com- 
paring the pooled group with 25% MF59 doses with the pooled 
group with 50% MF59 dose, GMTs at Day 29 show additional 
increases of approximately 28% for A/H1N1, 29% for A/H3N2, 
24% for B/Florida, and 8% for B/Malaysia, and at Day 50, GMTs 
show additional increases of approximately 23% for H1N1, 13% 
for H3N2, 36% for B\Florida, and 9% for B\Malaysia (Fig. 1A–D). 
(v) All MF59-adjuvanted formulations but none of the nonad- 
juvanted formulations induced superior antibody responses 
after the second vaccination against all virus strains compared 
with the pediatric nonadjuvanted licensed comparator Vaxigrip 
(cid:2)g TIV). None of the other study vaccine groups met the 
(7.5 
noninferiority criterion for GMT against any of the four strains 
(H1N1, H3N1, B/Florida, B/Malaysia) when compared with the 
vaccine formulated with 7.5-(cid:2)g TIV/QIV adjuvanted with 50% 
MF59 dose.

All 410 enrolled subjects were included in the data set for the 
assessment of safety and tolerability. The proportions of subjects 
per antigen dose and per MF59 adjuvant dose with reported local 
or systemic reactions after the ﬁrst or second vaccine doses are 
illustrated in Fig. 2A and B, respectively. As already mentioned, 
the 100% MF59 groups received only one vaccination; all other 
groups received two. The percentages of children with any local 
reaction ranged from 29% to 59% across vaccine groups (50% for 
the comparator licensed vaccine, Vaxigrip); percentages of chil- 
dren with any systemic reactions ranged from 35% to 68% (46% for 
Vaxigrip). There was no tendency for an increase in local and sys- 
temic solicited reactions with increasing MF59 content, either in

terms of frequency or severity. Reactogenicity of the 7.5-(cid:2)g TIV/QIV 
formulations was slightly lower than for the corresponding 15- 
(cid:2)g formulations. Most commonly reported local reactions were 
erythema (12–44% across groups), followed by tenderness (5–41% 
across groups). Local reactions were all mild or moderate, transient, 
and mostly observed within 1–4 days following vaccination, with 
ﬁrst onset peaking at 6 h postvaccination, and resolving within 7 
days. Irritability was the most frequently reported systemic reac- 
tion (12–43% across groups). For each solicited systemic reaction, 
the frequency and duration was as expected in a study of inﬂuenza 
vaccination in a pediatric population. 
Spontaneously reported AEs occurred in 58–96% of children 
across vaccine groups (Fig. 3) of which 4–36% were considered 
at least possibly related. There was no dose-response pattern for 
MF59 adjuvant and antigen dose for unsolicited AEs. Overall, the 
most frequently observed unsolicited AEs were upper respiratory 
tract infection, cough, pyrexia, crying, diarrhea, and irritability. Of 
those considered at least possibly related to vaccination, the most 
common were pyrexia, cough, and irritability. All possibly and 
probably related AEs reported were known common side effects 
of inﬂuenza vaccination in children. Furthermore, the majority of 
unsolicited AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Two subjects 
in the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine groups experienced hypersensi- 
tivity events, that is, allergic reaction and worsening of allergic 
reaction, which lasted 1 and 4 days, respectively; both events 
were rated as mild and assessed as not related to the study vac- 
cine. A total of nine SAEs were reported and were distributed 
across vaccine groups with no clustering related to adjuvant or 
antigen content. One SAE (lymphadenitis) was reported in the 
nonadjuvanted 7.5-(cid:2)g QIV group, 1 SAE (gastroenteritis) in the 
nonadjuvanted 15-(cid:2)g QIV group, 1 SAE (pyelonephritis) in the

the SAEs was considered to be related to the study vaccine. There 
were no deaths. One subject discontinued from the study owing 
to an AE (an ear infection), which was considered unrelated to 
vaccination. 


Previous reports have shown that unprimed young children 
respond suboptimally to 
Indeed, a recent 
Cochrane analysis implies that conventional TIVs have limited efﬁ- 
cacy in young children and toddlers [7], who are at higher risk for 
inﬂuenza-related complications [1]. Vaccine efﬁcacy may be even 
further compromised when there is a mismatch between the virus 
strains included in the vaccine and the actual strains in circula- 
tion [29]. Since the early 1980s, two distinct lineages of B inﬂuenza 
strains have often cocirculated in humans, and there is no cross- 
protection between these lineages. Adding an additional B strain to 
the traditional TIV is expected to signiﬁcantly broaden the cover- 
age of the vaccine, while adding an adjuvant such as MF59 has been 
shown to enhance the immune responses in general and broaden 
it to cover heterologous strains [30–32]. 
In this study we found that the addition of the second B 
strain improved immunologic response to the matched antigen 
and did not negatively affect immunogenicity of the other virus 
strains. Furthermore, the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine formulations 
induced superior antibody responses compared with nonadju- 
vanted comparators for all virus strains. Both 7.5-(cid:2)g and 15-(cid:2)g 
MF59-adjuvanted formulations met all three EU CHMP licensure 
criteria speciﬁed for adults after the ﬁrst vaccination for A/H1N1 
and A/H3N2 strains and after the second vaccination for the two 
 strains. In contrast, none of the nonadjuvanted vaccine formula- 
B 
(cid:2)g TIV/QIV or the licensed pediatric comparator 
tions – 7.5 and 15 
(cid:2)g TIV) – met CHMP criteria for licensure after the ﬁrst 
Vaxigrip (7.5 
or second vaccinations in this population of children aged 6 to <36 
months in this study. Further, results show that a single vaccination 
of MF59-adjuvanted vaccine might induce generally high antibody 
responses to inﬂuenza A strains, which may have important clinical 
implications, for example, in case of vaccination late in the inﬂuenza 
season or in case of poor compliance with the two-dose schedule. 


Adjuvants have been developed to improve the performance of 
vaccines, and MF59, an oil-in-water emulsion containing naturally 
occurring squalene, has been approved for human use since 1997 
as an inﬂuenza subunit vaccine adjuvant for elderly adults [23]. 
Previous clinical studies have demonstrated that MF59-adjuvanted 
inﬂuenza vaccines induced higher and broader antibody responses 
than nonadjuvanted vaccines, especially in subjects with low pre- 
vaccination antibody titers, in vulnerable populations including 
the elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions, and, 
most recently, in young children [8,22,33–35]. We observed a 
dose–response trend for immunogenicity with increasing MF59 
dose for all inﬂuenza stains. GMTs at Day 29 and Day 50 for pooled 
(cid:2)g antigens combined) showed 
MF59 dose groups (7.5 and 15 
additional increases of 28% and 23% for A/H1N1, 29% and 13% for 
A/H3N2, 24% and 36% for B/Florida, and 8% and 9% for B/Malaysia, 
respectively, for the pooled group with 50% over the one with 
25% of the adult MF59 dose group. Also, results from regression 
(cid:2)g vs 0 and 
analyses suggest that increasing antigen dose (15 
(cid:2)g) in combination with increasing MF59 dose was associ- 
7.5 
ated with higher antibody responses for A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and ﬁrst 
B 

The overall safety and tolerability proﬁles were as expected 
in this age group and were in line with previous studies using 
MF59-adjuvanted vaccines in young children [8,34]. There was 
no tendency for an increase in local or systemic solicited reac- 
tions nor in unsolicited AEs with increasing MF59 content in terms 
of either frequency or severity. However, the reactogenicity and 
safety proﬁle of the full MF59 dose level could not be adequately 
assessed because only one vaccination was given in the corre- 
sponding groups and because of limited experience with high MF59 
doses in young children. Reactogenicity of the 7.5-(cid:2)g TIV/QIV for- 
mulations was slightly lower than for the corresponding 15-(cid:2)g 
formulations, but inclusion of the second B strain did not appear to 
affect reactogenicity. Altogether, the safety results did not reveal 
an increased risk associated with MF59 dose, antigen dose, or the 
addition of a second B strain. 
In conclusion, this study conﬁrms that the immunogenicity of 
nonadjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccines is suboptimal in young children 
and indicates that 
• Addition of MF59 adjuvant promotes HI antibody responses to 
levels associated with protection in adults to an extent not 
achieved by nonadjuvanted vaccines and with no impact on reac- 
togenicity and safety in these young children 
• While the combination of the 7.5-(cid:2)g antigen and 50% MF59 
appears to offer the best balance between signiﬁcantly improved 
immunogenicity and good tolerability, the incremental increase 
over 25% MF59 was relatively small, and this dose may be consid- 
ered if future experience raises any concerns over reactogenicity 
• A second inﬂuenza B strain combined with the traditional TIV 
vaccine is immunogenic and does not affect immunogenicity of 
the other three inﬂuenza strains 
• The MF59-adjuvanted TIV and QIV vaccines already show a mean- 
ingful immune response to inﬂuenza A strains after one dose, 
which may be beneﬁcial in real-life clinical practice where a sec- 
ond dose is often missed, but the two-dose vaccination schedule 
must continue to be recommended in young children to provide 
protection against inﬂuenza B strains. 
Further studies of quadrivalent and MF59-adjuvanted inﬂuenza 
vaccines in young children, including efﬁcacy trials, are warranted.
