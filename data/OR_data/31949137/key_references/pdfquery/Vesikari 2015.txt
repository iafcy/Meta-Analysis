Routine annual inﬂuenza immunization is increasingly recommended in young children. We compared the safety 
and immunogenicity of vaccination with trivalent inactivated inﬂuenza vaccine (TIV) versus MF59-adjuvanted TIV (aTIV) 
in children who received 2 half or full doses of aTIV or TIV, or non-inﬂuenza control vaccine, 
in an efﬁcacy trial 
conducted 2 years earlier. 197 healthy children aged 30–96 months were randomized to receive vaccination with aTIV 
or TIV in 2010. To evaluate responses to the ﬁrst follow-up seasonal vaccination after priming we excluded children who 
received inﬂuenza vaccine(s) in the 2009 pandemic year leaving 40 children vaccinated with aTIV, 26 children with TIV 
and 10 children with aTIV after a control vaccine in the parent study. Hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies were 
assayed on Days 1, 22 and 181. aTIV vaccination produced 6.9 to 8.0-fold higher antibody responses than the reference 
TIV-TIV regimen against A/H3N2 and B strains, which remained higher 6 months following vaccination. The response to 
the B/Victoria lineage antigen in the second year’s vaccine (the ﬁrst vaccine contained a B/Yamagata lineage antigen) 
demonstrated that aTIV primed for an adequate response after a single dose on Day 22 (GMTs 160, 95 to antigens in 
the 2 lineages, respectively), whereas TIV did not (GMTs 38, 20). Vaccination with aTIV produced slightly higher but 
acceptable local and systemic reactogenicity compared to TIV-TIV and TIV-aTIV mixed regimens. Within the limitations 
of a small study, the strong immune responses support the use of aTIV for vaccination in young children. 

Routine annual inﬂuenza immunization of children is recom- 
mended in the USA and Finland where nearly half of children 
who are hospitalized for inﬂuenza were previously healthy, with- 
out recognized risk factors.1-5 Similarly, 40% of fatal inﬂuenza 
cases in children occur in previously healthy children.6 These 
characteristics of pediatric inﬂuenza support the universal use of 
inﬂuenza vaccine in children at an early age with annual 
revaccinations. 
Although the medical need for routine inﬂuenza immuniza- 
tion in children is clear, available vaccines have limitations; triva- 
lent inactivated inﬂuenza vaccines (TIV) have less than optimal 
efﬁcacy and live-attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine (LAIV) has restric- 
tions for children under 24 months years of age because of safety 
concerns.7–9 While TIV may be »40–60% efﬁcacious in chil- 
dren under 6 years old, there is no clear evidence for efﬁcacy in 
the youngest age group, 6–23 month-olds.8,9 LAIV has been 
shown to be more efﬁcacious than TIV in 2–7 year-olds, but 
cannot be used in children under 5 years of age who have a his- 
tory of wheezing, and not at all in children under 24 months of 
age.7,10 
The use of adjuvants such as MF59 can signiﬁcantly enhance 
the immune response in previously unvaccinated children, with 
protective antibodies levels being achieved earlier and lasting lon- 
ger than with non-adjuvanted TIV.11,12 MF59 also stimulates a 
broader immune response that may provide for increased efﬁcacy 
against heterovariant strains.13-15 MF59

vaccine, the adjuvanted seasonal TIV (aTIV) indicated for older 
adults (Fluad 



We previously demonstrated in a head to head trial in vaccine- 
na€ıve 6–71 month old children (conducted principally in the 
2007–2008 season) that aTIV had 86% efﬁcacy in preventing 
laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza while conﬁrming in the same trial 
the modest efﬁcacy of TIV, at 42%.11 This phase 3b extension 
study was conducted to assess the safety and immunogenicity of 
vaccination with aTIV vs. TIV (Agrippal

children from the previous efﬁcacy trial, now at 30– 96 months 
of age.11 The 2009 H1N1 pandemic prevented us from evaluat- 
ing the vaccination response in the season immediately following 
the efﬁcacy trial. All subjects who received either seasonal or 
monovalent pandemic vaccine in 2009 were excluded in this 
study analysis, in order to more clearly demonstrate the immune 
response of re-vaccination in the ﬁrst follow-up seasonal vaccina- 
tion after priming. The vaccine strains in 2010–2011 [A/ Califor- 
nia/7/2009 (H1N1), A/ Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/ 
60/2008 (Victoria)] were antigenically distinct from those in the 
priming vaccine in 2008–2009 [A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), 
A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2), and B/Florida/4/2006 (Yama- 
gata)], providing us with the opportunity to examine prime to 
boost responses in young children following a change in B anti- 
gens, from B/Yamagata lineage to B/Victoria lineage strain. 

Subjects 
Fewer subjects were enrolled in the extension study than the 
originally planned 1970 subjects, due to parental concerns in 
Finland with narcolepsy associated with an AS03-adjuvanted 
H1N1 vaccine that was used in several European countries 
including Finland during the 2009 H1N1 inﬂuenza pandemic.18 
In total, 197 subjects were enrolled and were categorized into 
2 age cohorts, 6 -< 36 months (n D 29) and 36 -< 96 months 
(n D 168). The younger age group was too small to draw conclu- 
sions on the immune response so the age cohorts were combined 
and results were grouped by vaccine received. Of the 197 subjects 
that were enrolled and randomized to receive aTIV (n D 135) 
and TIV (n D 62), 188 completed the study. Reasons for prema- 
ture withdrawal were withdrawal of consent (N D 4) and loss to 
follow-up (N D 5) (Fig. 1). To more clearly demonstrate the 
immune responses to vaccination in follow-up seasonal vaccina- 
tion after priming, all subjects who received inﬂuenza vaccine in 
2009, seasonal or monovalent pandemic, were excluded from the 
immunogenicity and safety analyses presented in this report. Ulti- 
mately, 40 children revaccinated with aTIV, 26 children revacci- 
nated with TIV, and 10 control children receiving inﬂuenza 
vaccine for the ﬁrst time (and were administered aTIV) were 
included in the analyses for this study (Fig. 1).

jects by priming and subsequent vaccines are presented in

TIV: trivalent inactivated inﬂuenza vaccines, aTIV: MF59 adjuvanted TIV, SD: standard deviation. 
Children vaccinated with non-inﬂuenza control during parent study only received aTIV in the extension study. 
Table 1. Vaccine groups were comparable with respect to age, 
body size characteristics, and the majority of study subjects were 
Caucasian. There was a higher proportion of girls in the children 
primed with TIV and revaccinated with TIV and those who pre- 
viously received the control non-inﬂuenza vaccines and were vac- 
cinated with aTIV.

mittee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) criterion; the percentage of subjects achieving seroprotection (HI antibody titer (cid:2)40) should be 
>70%, the percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion should be (cid:2)40% and geometric mean ratio should be >2.5. None of the subjects were vac- 
cinated with seasonal or pandemic vaccine in 2009. Children vaccinated with non-inﬂuenza control during parent study only received aTIV in the exten- 
sion study. 
Immunogenicity analyses 
Evaluation of immunogenicity criteria according to European 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
criteria is presented in Figure 2. Subjects who were primed with 
aTIV and TIV and vaccinated with aTIV in the extension study 
met all 3 CHMP criteria for seroprotection (>70%), seroconver- 
sion (>40%) and geometric mean ratio (GMR) (>2.5) against 
the 3 homologous strains with persistence up to 6 months fol- 
lowing vaccination. Subjects who were primed with TIV and vac- 
cinated with aTIV or TIV in the extension study met all 3 
CHMP criteria against A/California/7/2009 (A/H1N1) and A/ 
Perth/16/2009 (A/H3N2) and 2 out of 3 criteria (vaccination 
aTIV) and 1 out of 3 criteria (vaccination TIV) against B/Bris- 
bane/60/2008 (Victoria). Children who were previously vacci- 
nated with non-inﬂuenza control vaccine and vaccinated with 
aTIV met all CHMP criteria except for seroprotection against B/ 
Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria) at Day 22. When using Center for 
Biologics Evaluation & Research (CBER) criteria, only the sub- 
jects who were primed with aTIV and revaccinated with aTIV 
met both CBER criteria for seroconversion and seroprotection at 
Day 22 (Fig. 2). 
Percentages of subjects achieving a more stringent cut-off 
criterion hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer (cid:2)110 are pre- 
sented in Figure 3. In children primed with aTIV, HI titers 
(cid:2)110 at Day 22 were achieved in 94% (A/H1N1), 100% (A/ 
H3N2) and 69% (B/Brisbane/60/2008) after vaccination with 
aTIV and 75% (A/H1N1), 100% (A/H3N2) and 58% (B/ 
Brisbane/60/2008) following vaccination with TIV. In TIV- 
primed children, the proportion achieving HI titres of (cid:2)110 
were 91%, 100% and 22% (vaccination aTIV) and 100%, 
71% and 0% (vaccination TIV) against A/H1N1, A/H3N2 
and B strains, respectively. In children previously vaccinated 
with non-inﬂuenza control and vaccinated with aTIV, 89% 
achieved a titer (cid:2)110 to A/H1N1, 100% to H3N2 and 33% 
to B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage). 
Day 181 HI titers (cid:2)110 were achieved in 24–100% and 
8–100% in children after vaccination with aTIV and TIV, 
respectively (Fig. 3). 



Figure 3. Percentages of subjects with HI antibody titers (cid:2)110 in children 30-< 96 months old vaccinated with aTIV or TIV, by priming vaccine. None of

aTIV in the extension study. 
13.1 fold rise. aTIV vaccinated children maintained a 2.7 fold 
higher GMT compared to TIV vaccinated children at 
6 months. The GMT of the aTIV-aTIV group (925) was 7.7 
fold higher than the TIV-TIV group (120) at 
that point 
(Table 2). 
aseline titers to the Victoria lineage B/Brisbane/60/2008 
strain were uniformly low in all groups, including those who had 
been primed with 2 vaccine doses in 2008–2009, as that formula- 
tion contained a B/Yamagata lineage strain. The children who 
had been primed with TIV and were revaccinated with TIV 
mounted a suboptimal response against the B/Victoria lineage 
antigen from GMT 5 (pre-vaccination) to GMT 20 (Day 22 
post-vaccination) and GMT 17 (Day 181 post-vaccination). In 
contrast, aTIV-primed children responded with at least 10-fold 
rises to the B/Victoria lineage antigen, achieving GMTs of 160 
and 95 on Day 22, whether they were revaccinated with adju- 
vanted or non-adjuvanted vaccine, respectively, with persistence 
of higher GMTs (135 and 94) up to 6 months following vaccina- 
tion. The six month GMT of the aTIV-aTIV group was almost 
8-fold higher than that of the TIV-TIV group. The responses of 
the TIV-primed children were intermediate and reached a low 
level of <40. In unprimed control subjects, who received aTIV 
in their ﬁrst inﬂuenza vaccination, GMTs at Day 22 and 181 
were 74 and 178, respectively. Moderately high responses to the 
B/Yamagata lineage strain following the initial 2 doses of adju- 
vanted vaccine indicated priming for the B/Victoria lineage anti- 
gen, whereas this was not observed following primary vaccination 
with TIV. A single vaccination dose of aTIV in the latter subjects 
compensated to some degree but the cross-lineage titers remained 
lower than those in children primed with adjuvanted vaccine 
(Table 2). 

H1N1 
Although subjects who received the 2009 pandemic vaccine 
were excluded from this analysis, baseline titers in all 3 groups 
suggested that pandemic exposure had occurred relatively uni- 
formly in all groups, with geometric mean titers (GMTs) in the 
range of 33 to 59. All groups responded well to their ﬁrst vaccina- 
tion against A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) irrespective of having 
received adjuvanted, non-adjuvanted or no previous inﬂuenza 
vaccine in the earlier study, with 12.6 to 27.9 fold increases in 
response to aTIV and 9.7 to 24.2 fold increases in response to 
TIV. Six months later, higher titers, in the range of 1.3 to 1.4 
fold higher, were maintained in the aTIV- compared to TIV-vac- 
cinated children (Table 2). 
H3N2 
Baseline antibody titers were 2.3 to 5.8 fold higher in chil- 
dren who had previously received aTIV compared to children 
who had been vaccinated originally with TIV. However, better 
persistence of 
the antibody-induced response in the aTIV- 
primed group cannot be inferred because control children who 
had not previously received inﬂuenza vaccine had evidence of 
baseline H3N2 antibodies at even higher levels, presumably 
deriving from natural 
infection. Children primed with aTIV 
and those who had received control vaccines (and who had evi- 
dence of natural infection) responded to aTIV with a 10.4 to 
14.3 fold rise to a GMT of~2200 at Day 22. Children who had 
been primed with TIV and then boosted with aTIV exhibited a 
17.7 fold rise, though to a lower absolute GMT of 1205 as their 
baseline titer after TIV priming was lower. The other mixed 
regimen of aTIV followed by TIV produced an intermediate 
rise of 4.5 fold to a GMT of 678, while successive TIV vaccina- 
tions produced the lowest GMT of 328, albeit as a result of a

TIV: trivalent inactivated inﬂuenza vaccines, aTIV: MF59 adjuvanted TIV, Control (children have not been vaccinated with inﬂuenza vaccine previously, they 
only received aTIV in the extension study). Systemic reactions were classiﬁed as present or not present. 
Safety 
Local and systemic adverse reactions across the vaccine groups, 
by priming vaccine are summarized in Table 3 (6-<36 months) 
and Table 4 (36-<96 months). Overall, reactogenicity of aTIV 
was slightly higher than for TIV, though not to a marked or clini- 
cally unacceptable extent. The majority of children reported at 
least one reactogenicity sign post-vaccination. Reactions were 
transient and mostly mild to moderate in severity. In the 6- 
<36 months cohort, the most common reported local reaction 
was tenderness with no reports of severe reactions. Most frequent 
reported systemic reactions were unusual crying and irritability. 
There was one report of severe fever (cid:2)39.3(cid:1)C in the youngest 
age group following vaccination with TIV. In the age group 36- 
<96 months, the most common reported local reaction was 
injection site pain reported in 67% to 92% across vaccination 
groups. There were no reports of severe local reactions. The most 
commonly reported systemic reaction was fatigue, followed by 
myalgia. There were 2 reports of severe systemic adverse events 
(AEs) in subjects receiving aTIV (headache and malaise) and 1 
report of severe systemic AE in a subject receiving TIV (myalgia). 
Fever (cid:2)37.3(cid:1)C occurred in up to 14% of subjects across groups, 
with no reports of severe fever. 
Spontaneously reported AEs were comparable across vaccine 
groups, regardless of priming vaccine in the parent study or

18% was considered at least possibly related. One subject receiv- 
ing aTIV experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) (snake bite), 
considered as not related to study vaccination. There were no 
deaths and no AEs leading to premature study discontinuation. 
In the subpopulation of children that received pandemic 
AS03-adjuvanted vaccine in 2009, similar trends were observed 
for immunogenicity and safety outcomes (Tables S1 and S2). 

Routine inﬂuenza vaccination in children, beginning at 
6 months of age, is increasingly recommended as children and 
infants experience the highest rates of seasonal inﬂuenza infection 
and hospitalisation.1-4 We previously showed in a head to head 
trial in vaccine-na€ıve 6–71 month old children that aTIV was 
86% efﬁcacious in preventing PCR-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza, com- 
pared with 42% for TIV.11 Moreover, aTIV was efﬁcacious in 
every age subgroup (96% in 36–71 months olds, 81% in 6– 
35 months olds, and 75% in 6–23 months olds) at efﬁcacy rates 
that are in the range expected for a routinely administered child- 
hood vaccine.11 The MF59-adjuvanted vaccine was also well tol- 
erated and in an integrated analysis of 1181 children who 
received aTIV in clinical trials no pattern of associated serious 
AEs was demonstrated.16 Because inﬂuenza vaccine must be 
administered annually, if aTIV was to be used in national sched- 
ules, data on its immunological advantage as well as its tolerabil- 
ity and safety upon repeated vaccination are needed. 
Here we report the results of an extension study of vaccination 
with aTIV versus TIV in children now aged 30–96 months, 
whose only inﬂuenza vaccination had been in the previous efﬁ- 
cacy trial 2 years earlier. The 2009 pandemic prevented us from 
assessing the vaccination response in the season immediately fol- 
lowing the efﬁcacy trial. To examine the immune responses of 
vaccination in the ﬁrst follow-up seasonal vaccination after prim- 
ing, we excluded all subjects who received either seasonal or pan- 
demic vaccination in 2009 from the study analyses. Therefore, 
only small datasets could be analyzed, which should be taken 
into consideration in interpreting the results. 
The results of this study demonstrate that the aTIV-aTIV 
sequence produced 6.8-fold and 8-fold higher antibody responses 
to A/H3N2 and B strains, respectively, than the reference TIV- 
TIV regimen (referring to the vaccination given in the efﬁcacy 
study and the current study, respectively), but not to A/H1N1 
strain. Also, for A/H3N2 and B strains, primary vaccination with 
aTIV was found to be more immunogenic than 2 consecutive 
vaccinations with TIV. 
The magnitude of the difference between aTIV-aTIV and 
TIV-TIV regimen was especially important for inﬂuenza B where 
TIV-TIV provided only a GMT of 20 (Day 22) in the second 
year while for aTIV-aTIV, the GMT response on Day 22 was 
160. For the mixed regimens of aTIV-TIV or TIV-aTIV, the 
advantage of aTIV in the second year varied with viral subtype, 
as inferred from elevated baseline GMTs to that viral subtype. 
For example, the elevated baseline titers and responses to the pan- 
demic H1N1 component in aTIV were similar, irrespective of 
whether the children had been primed with aTIV, TIV or had 
had no prior inﬂuenza vaccination at all. The uniformly elevated 
baseline titers in all subjects suggested similar experiences with 
the pandemic infection in all groups and because the 2008–2009 
inﬂuenza vaccine contained an H1N1 strain that was so highly 
divergent from the pandemic H1N1 strain, it provided no addi- 
tional detectable priming to the naturally-acquired pandemic 
infection upon H1N1pnd09 immunisation.19,20 Those titers 
were »2-fold higher in the aTIV compared with TIV recipients 
irrespective of priming history, demonstrating the impact of the 
adjuvant. However, the sample sizes were small and the conﬁ- 
dence intervals between aTIV and TIV overlapped, therefore the 
difference was not signiﬁcant. 

A similar but more complex pattern was seen in response to 
the H3N2 antigen against which the aTIV-primed children, 
and the control children who received aTIV for the ﬁrst time 
had similarly elevated baseline and post-vaccination responses 
to the H3N2 antigen. 
is not possible to discriminate 
whether the elevated baseline titer in the aTIV group may 
have reﬂected a declining antibody titer from vaccination 
2 years earlier or an intervening H3N2 infection or both. 
These responses were higher than in the other groups. In the 
TIV-aTIV children poorer persistence of antibody after prim- 
ing and, possibly, a lower rate of naturally acquired infection 
in the intervening year (reﬂected in a lower baseline GMT) 
led to an intermediate response to the vaccination with aTIV. 
In contrast, vaccination with TIV in the aTIV-TIV group led 
to a lower GMT response, though the group had a similar 
indicating again, the impact of the 
baseline antibody titer, 
adjuvant in the vaccination vaccine. Finally, the TIV-TIV 
group, whose baseline titers were the lowest, had the lowest 
response to vaccination. 
The response to the B/Victoria lineage antigen in the second 
year vaccination (while the ﬁrst vaccine contained a B/Yamagata 
lineage antigen) showed that aTIV primed with the B/Yamagata 
lineage antigen boosted the secondary antibody response against 
the opposing lineage (GMTs 160 for aTIV, 95 for aTIV-TIV), 
whereas, as noted previously, TIV did not (GMTs 38 for TIV- 
aTIV and 20 for TIV-TIV).21 However, as cross priming in the 
other direction was not studied, it would be inappropriate to 
speculate about cross-lineage responses in general. The cross-line- 
age priming associated with aTIV, though of great interest, is 
perhaps moot from a public health perspective, as quadrivalent 
formulations containing antigens from both B lineages are 
becoming the new standard for children. We also reconﬁrmed 
the phenomenon of original antigenic sin – at least in the direc- 
tion of stronger responses to a ﬁrst exposure to B/Yamagata anti- 
gen – with stronger responses to the priming B/Yamagata lineage 
antigen that had been administered 2 years earlier, compared to 
the response to the more recently administered B/Victoria lineage 
antigen.22,23 
The maintenance of elevated antibodies at high levels for 
6 months by the regimen of repeated aTIV administration is of 
importance as annual vaccination campaigns in the 
practical 



Northern Hemisphere now begin in August while the peak 
month of inﬂuenza transmission is in February.24 And in areas of 
the world where inﬂuenza viral transmission is sustained for lon- 
ger intervals or maintained throughout the calendar year, anti- 
bodies induced by a single annual vaccination ideally would 
persist at protective levels for up to a year.25 
The lower absolute levels of HI antibodies to the vaccine- 
matched and variant B strains, compared with the A subtype 
responses should be interpreted in the context of the low sensitiv- 
ity of the HI assay in detecting antibodies to the B vaccine com- 
ponent.26 Compared to HI test results, neutralizing antibody 
titers elicited by the inactivated vaccine generally are higher and 
are equally high for B and A components.27,28 
Vaccination with aTIV produced slightly higher but accept- 
able local and systemic reactogenicity compared with repeated 
TIV vaccination, while the mixed regimens of aTIV-TIV and 
TIV-aTIV were similar to the “reference” TIV-TIV regimen in 
terms of the pattern and frequency of local and systemic adverse 
events. For unsolicited AEs, the pattern and frequency were gen- 
erally similar between groups. There were no vaccine-related 
SAEs. Prior to the study, there were concerns of enhanced AEs 
following revaccination one year following the original study, or 
when the similar antigenic strains were used in the second round 
of vaccinations. However, enhanced reactivity was not observed. 
Thus, within the limited experience of this study with small data 
sets, the considerably higher antibody titers achieved upon vacci- 
nation with aTIV, with a minor increase in reactogenicity, pro- 
vides a beneﬁt:risk that might be justiﬁable.29 
Higher antibody titers are needed in young children to 
produce levels of efﬁcacy seen in adults at lower titers of 
»40. In the efﬁcacy study prior to this follow-up, we showed 
that an HI titer of 110 was correlated with a vaccine efﬁcacy 
of 50%, and 330 with a clinical efﬁcacy of 80% against the 
circulating H3N2 strain,12 although this needs to be con- 
ﬁrmed in other studies. The demonstration that an HI titer 
of 40 correlated with 50% protection in children 6–17 years 
of age supports an age threshold within this range when a 
majority of children will have been primed – consistent with 
recommendations in the US that children under 9 years of 
age need 2 doses in their ﬁrst season of vaccination in order 
to prime them.30 Thus the greater reliance on antibodies for 
protection provided by the inactivated vaccine in young chil- 
dren favors the annual use of aTIV starting at 6 months and 
through an undeﬁned age, probably in the interval between 6 
and 9 years of age. 
The impact of inﬂuenza vaccination on T-cell immunity in 
children, and differences elicited by inactivated vs. live attenuated 
vaccine, are currently important topics in the ﬁeld of inﬂuenza 
vaccine development. Some investigators have proposed that 
TIV vaccination of children may prevent the induction of a 
broad cellular immune response, which could place them at 
greater risk for pandemic inﬂuenza infection, although clinical 
evidence for this in the 2009 pandemic was unclear.31-38 
One limitation of this study was that there was no possibility 
to investigate the impact of aTIV on cellular 
immunity, 
although, in other studies, MF59 is known to stimulate T-cell 
immunity but not shown to bias the immune response in chil- 
dren toward Th1 or Th2.39-40 
Altogether, within the limitations of a small study, the 
strong immune responses and adequate safety proﬁle of aTIV 
support the use of such vaccines for annual vaccination in 
young children, beginning at 6 months of age. Ultimately, a 
study starting at 6 months of age followed by annual vaccina- 
tions using either aTIV or TIV should be designed to prove 
this assumption. 

Study design 
This Phase 3b, randomized, observer-blind, pediatric exten- 
sion study was performed at 15 sites across Finland from Septem- 
ber 2010 until 
January 2011 (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: 
NCT01210898). The protocol was approved by the Ethics Com- 
mittee of the Pirkanmaa Hospital District, and the study was per- 
formed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki 
and Good Clinical Practice. Before enrollment, written informed 
consent was obtained from all parents/legal guardians. 


Objective 
In the previously reported efﬁcacy study (ClinicalTrials.gov: 
NCT01015885) greater immunogenicity and efﬁcacy were dem- 
onstrated for aTIV over split TIV (Inﬂusplit SSW 
, GlaxoS- 
mithKline Biologicals) 
in 
2008–2009.11 The main objective of this extension study was to 
evaluate the immunogenicity following vaccination with aTIV or 
subunit TIV administered as age-dependent full or half doses in 
2010–2011 according to the criteria deﬁned by the European 
CHMP and US. CBER.41,42 All subjects who received either sea- 
sonal or monovalent pandemic vaccine in 2009 were excluded 
from the analyses. Additional objectives were to assess antibody 
persistence at 6 months following vaccination and to evaluate the 
reactogenicity and safety proﬁles for each vaccine. SAEs were col- 
lected up to 1 year postvaccination. 
Of those subjects receiving pandemic vaccination in 2009 
(AS03-adjuvanted containing vaccine Pandemrix 
, GSK), safety 
and immunogenicity against A/H1N1 strain were added as sup- 
plementary data 

Subjects 
Eligible study participants were healthy children who had 
received 2 doses of at least 1 of the study vaccines in the previous 
parent trial and whose parents/legal guardians had given prior 
written informed consent. Principal exclusion criteria included 
any history or ongoing (chronic) illness likely to interfere with 
the results; hypersensitivity to vaccine components; receipt of any 
other vaccine <2 weeks (for inactivated vaccines) or 4 weeks (for 
live vaccines) prior to enrollment in this study or who were plan- 
ning to receive any vaccine <4 weeks from the study vaccine; 
participation in any clinical trial with another investigational 
product 30 days prior to the ﬁrst study visit or intention to par- 
ticipate in another clinical study at any time during the conduct 



of this study; antibiotics <6 days before vaccination; axillary 
temperature (cid:2)37.3(cid:1)C within 3 days prior to the ﬁrst visit, and 
receipt of blood, blood products and/or plasma derivative or any 
parenteral 
immunoglobulin preparation in the previous 
12 weeks. 
Study procedures 
In the original efﬁcacy study, subjects were primed in 2008– 
09 with 2 age-appropriate doses of TIV, aTIV or noninﬂuenza 
control vaccine (Control) vaccines (meningococcal C conjugate 
[Menjugate(cid:1), Novartis Vaccines] or tickborne encephalitis vac- 
cines [Encepur Children(cid:1), Novartis Vaccines]). In this study, 
aTIV- and TIV-primed children were re-randomized to be revac- 
cinated with either aTIV or TIV. Children aged <36 months 
were randomized 1:1 to receive half a dose (0.25mL) of TIV or 
aTIV; children (cid:2)36 months of age were randomized 1:1:1 to 
receive a full dose (0.5mL) of TIV, or a half or full dose of aTIV. 
Inﬂuenza vaccine-na€ıve control subjects previously vaccinated 
with control noninﬂuenza received half a dose of aTIV (children 
<36 months), or were randomized 1:1 to receive half or full 
dose of aTIV (children aged (cid:2)36 months). Because the numbers 
of subjects in these dose subgroups were so small, they were com- 
bined within each treatment arm for this paper. 
Blood samples (5 mL per sample) were obtained for immuno- 
genicity analyses at baseline (Day 1, prevaccination), 3 weeks 
after vaccination (Day 22), and approximately 6 months (Day 
181) after immunization. 
Vaccines 
aTIV and TIV each contained 15 mg of hemagglutinin anti- 
gen from each of the 3 World Health Organization recom- 
mended inﬂuenza strains for the 2010–2011 inﬂuenza season in 
the northern hemisphere: A/ California/7/2009 (H1N1), A/ 
Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008(Victoria). 
A standard dose of the adjuvant MF59, as used in one 0.5-mL 
dose of the commercially available seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine 
Fluad, contains 9.75 mg squalene, 1.175 mg polysorbate 80, 
1.175 mg sorbitan trioleate, 0.66 mg sodium citrate, 0.04 mg 
citric acid, and water for injection. Vaccines were supplied in 
monodose, preﬁlled syringes ﬁlled with 0.5 mL with a pediatric 
mark at 0.25mL for administration in subjects <36 months. 
The vaccine formulations were prepared and administered by 
unblinded study personnel, who otherwise did not participate in 
evaluation of the subjects during the study. The vaccines were 
administered intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle preferably of 
the non-dominant arm. 
Immunogenicity assessment 
Blood samples taken for immunologic assays were tested at the 
Novartis Vaccines Clinical Serology Laboratory in Marburg, 
Germany, for HI antibody responses to strains contained in the 
vaccine (vide supra). HI antibody responses on Days 1, 22, and 
181 were expressed as GMTs, GMRs of the postvaccination to 
prevaccination titer (Day 22/Day 1 titer and Day 181/Day 1 
titer); seroprotection rates were deﬁned as the percentage of sub- 
jects with HI titers (cid:2)40, and seroconversion rates were deﬁned as 
the percentage of subjects per group achieving at least a 4-fold 
increase in HI titer from a seropositive prevaccination titer ((cid:2)10) 
or a rise from <10 to (cid:2)40 in those who were originally seronega- 
tive. Percentages of subjects with HI titers (cid:2)110 were also calcu- 
lated, as this cut-off titer was shown in one analysis to predict a 
50% clinical protective level in young children, compared with 
the conventional HI titer of (cid:2)1:40 associated with 50% protec- 
tion of young adults.12 
Safety assessment 
Subjects were monitored for 30 minutes after each vaccina- 
tion for possible immediate adverse reactions. Parents/legal 
guardians were unaware of the study vaccine administered to 
their children and were instructed to complete diary cards to 
record speciﬁed local and systemic reactions for 7 days, starting 
on the day of vaccination. Solicited local reactions included 
ecchymosis, erythema, induration, swelling and tenderness (chil- 
dren <36 months) or ecchymosis, erythema, induration, swell- 
ing and pain at injection site (children (cid:2)36 months). Solicited 
systemic reactions were sleepiness, diarrhea, vomiting, irritability, 
change in eating habits, shivering, and unusual crying (children 
<36 months of age), or chills, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, head- 
ache and fatigue (children (cid:2)36 months of age). Other indicators 
of reactogenicity were fever (axillary temperature (cid:2) 37.3(cid:1)C) and 
use of analgesics/antipyretic medication. Reports of any AEs were 
recorded from Day 1 to Day 22, SAEs and AEs leading to study 
withdrawal were recorded throughout the study period. The 
severity of AEs was categorized as mild, moderate, or severe, if 
they resulted in no limitation, some limitation, or inability to 
perform normal daily activities, respectively. Assessments of the 
causal relationship of unsolicited AEs to the vaccination were 
classiﬁed by the investigator as not related, possibly related, or 
probably related. 
Statistical analyses 
CHMP has not established inﬂuenza vaccine immunogenicity 
criteria for children so those used for young adults were refer- 
enced: the percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion for HI 
antibody should be >40%; the percentage of subjects achieving 
HI antibody titer (cid:2)40% should be >70% and the GMR should 
be >2.5.42 Immunogenicity was also analyzed using CBER crite- 
ria: the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 
for the percent of subjects achieving seroconversion for HI anti- 
body should be (cid:2)40% (seroconversion criterion); and the lower 
bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the percent of subjects achiev- 
ing an HI antibody titer (cid:2)40 should be (cid:2)70% (seroprotection 
criterion).41 Percentages of subjects with HI titers (cid:2)110 were 
also calculated. Log10-transformed antibody titers were modeled 
using analysis of variance for each strain, and GMTs, GMRs, 
and corresponding 2-sided 95% CI were calculated. Safety data 
were evaluated descriptively and expressed as the percentage or 
number of subjects with AEs in each group. Immunogenicity 
analyses were conducted on the full analyses set (FAS), which 
consisted of subjects who received the study vaccine and provided 
at least one evaluable serum sample before and after vaccination. 



Safety was analyzed for all subjects exposed to study vaccines who 
provided at least 1 safety data point.
