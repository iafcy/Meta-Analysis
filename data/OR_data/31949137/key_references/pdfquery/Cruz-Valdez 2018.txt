Introduction 
Inﬂuenza is a serious disease as it can lead to severe morbidity 
and mortality in at-risk groups such as children.1 Children 
experience the highest attack rates for inﬂuenza1 and while 
infections can be self-limiting in many cases, the risk of hospi- 
talization is increased in this population compared with healthy 
adults.2 Children can also disseminate inﬂuenza in households 
and the community as they shed virus for longer periods than 
adults, leading to inﬂuenza infections in others, including those 
at-risk (e.g. older adults [aged (cid:1)65 years], those with co-mor- 
bidities, and younger children).3,4 
Inﬂuenza was one of the top 10 causes of death in Mexico in 
2014 and therefore it is considered a public health priority.5 In 
2013, there were 4480 cases of conﬁrmed inﬂuenza across all 
age groups, which led to 314 deaths, the majority of whom 
were vulnerable or at-risk.5 An assessment of those hospitalized 
for inﬂuenza-like illness in Mexico City conﬁrmed inﬂuenza 
A/H3N2 and B in 25 and 29% respectively, of those aged 
(cid:3)18 years. Furthermore, of the different viruses assessed, the 
inﬂuenza virus was the most commonly identiﬁed.6 
Vaccination is the most effective method for preventing 
inﬂuenza and seasonal inﬂuenza vaccination is recommended 
by the World Health Organization (WHO) for children aged 
6 months to 5 years.7 For example, estimates from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that inﬂuenza vac- 
cination averted approximately 7.2 million illnesses, 3.1 million 
medically attended illnesses, and 90,000 hospitalizations associ- 
ated with inﬂuenza, across all ages, in the 2013–2014 inﬂuenza 
season in the United States alone.8 In Mexico, seasonal inﬂu- 
enza vaccination has been shown to signiﬁcantly (p D 0.00002) 
reduce inﬂuenza-related hospitalizations 
in children aged 
<5 years, from 7.5% before the vaccination program to 3.4% 
after vaccination was introduced.9 However, children tend to 
have a weak and short-lived immune response to current non- 
adjuvanted trivalent inﬂuenza vaccines (TIVs) because their 
immune systems are immature.2,4,10 The addition of adjuvants 
to trivalent 
(aTIVs) can enhance the 
immune response, potentially improving protection in this 
population.2,11-13

ABSTRACT 
The poor immune response elicited by trivalent inﬂuenza vaccines (TIVs) in children can be enhanced by the 
addition of adjuvants. This observer-blind, randomized Phase III trial assessed the immunogenicity and safety of 
the MF59-adjuvanted trivalent inﬂuenza vaccine FLUAD(cid:1) (aTIV) and a non-adjuvanted TIV, in healthy children 
(aged 6 to <72 months) from 3 centers in Mexico, during the 2014–2015 season. The primary objectives were to 
assess the non-inferiority of aTIV to TIV, measured by geometric mean titers (GMTs), and the safety of aTIV and 
TIV. Seroconversion was one of several secondary objectives. In total, 287 children were enrolled. The non- 
inferiority criteria for GMTs and seroconversion were met for aTIV for all 3 vaccine strains. Lower bounds of the 
95% conﬁdence intervals for all 3 aTIV:TIV vaccine ratios were >2, showing that the immunogenicity of aTIV was 
superior to that of TIV for all 3 strains. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were experienced more frequently with aTIV 
than TIV by younger children (aged 6 to <36 months), but were more frequent with TIV than aTIV in older 
children (aged 36 to <72 months) who had been vaccinated previously. More unsolicited AEs were associated 
with aTIV than the TIV. All AEs were of mild or moderate severity. No deaths, serious AEs, or AEs leading to 
premature withdrawal were reported. Overall, aTIV was highly immunogenic and was well tolerated in healthy 
children 6 to <72 months of age. These results indicate that aTIV may be a beneﬁcial addition to national 
pediatric vaccination programs. 
The inﬂuenza vaccine FLUAD(cid:1) includes the oil-in-water 
adjuvant MF59, which has been shown to boost the immune 
response in children, adults, and elderly individuals.10,12,14-16 
Results from several clinical trials in adults and the elderly have 
demonstrated the immunogenicity of FLUAD in these patient 
populations and it has been licensed for inﬂuenza prophylaxis 
in older adults since 1997.14,15,17 Results from a large Phase III 
trial in over 6000 children showed that higher and more dura- 
ble hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers against both homol- 
inﬂuenza strains were induced 
ogous and heterologous 
following vaccination with FLUAD (n D 3125) than with the 
TIV.11 In agreement with previous reports, reactogenicity rates 
were higher in FLUAD recipients than non-adjuvanted vaccine 
recipients, and the majority of events were mild or moderate in 
severity.11 Results from another Phase III trial that included 
over 4500 young children (aged 6–72 months), showed that 
FLUAD (n D 1934) was associated with an increase in vaccine 
efﬁcacy, antibody responses, and durability compared with a 
non-adjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccine.12 Antibody titers of (cid:1)40 
against heterologous strains were also induced by 2 doses of 
FLUAD in (cid:1)95% of recipients. The proportion of children 
aged 6–<36 months that experienced an adverse event (AE) 
was comparable between vaccination groups, with a relative 
risk of a solicited AE of 1.04 (95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 
0.98–1.09) for aTIV:TIV.12 FLUAD was recently licensed in 
children aged 6– 
Canada 




<24 months.18 FLUAD is currently approved in 38 countries, 
including Canada and many European countries, and it was 
recently approved by US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) for the prevention of seasonal inﬂuenza in individuals 
aged (cid:1)65 years.19 
This Phase III trial aimed to assess the safety and immunoge- 
nicity of FLUAD (aTIV), compared with a non-adjuvanted inﬂu- 
enza vaccine (Fluzone(cid:1); TIV), in healthy children at 3 centers in 
Mexico. The results will provide further evidence of the tolerabil- 
ity and immunogenicity of FLUAD in a pediatric population. 


In total, 287 healthy children were enrolled, 144 in the aTIV group 
and 143 in the TIV group (Fig. 1). Similar numbers of children 
were excluded from the per protocol population of each vaccine 
group; 30 from the aTIV group and 31 from the TIV group (Fig. 1). 
The most common reason for exclusion for both groups was 
non-compliance with the blood draw schedule. Similar numbers of 
children were enrolled by the 3 centers (n D 95, 117, and 75). 
The vaccine groups were well balanced at baseline (Table 1). 
The mean age was 29.5 months for the aTIV group and 
30.1 months for TIV, the split of males to females was approxi- 
mately even and 99% of children in either arm were Hispanic.

Overall, more children in both vaccine groups were vaccine- 
na€ıve and there was an even distribution of children across the 
3 age groups in both vaccine groups (Table 1). 

The non-inferiority criteria for geometric mean titers (GMTs) 
were met for all 3 virus strains in the overall population at 
21 days after the last vaccination (Table 2, Fig. 2). The GMTs 
were higher in the aTIV group than in the TIV group at 
21 days after the last vaccination. The mean GMT ratios (95% 
CIs) for aTIV:TIV were: 4 (3–6) for A(H1N1) strain, 3 (2–4) 
for A(H3N2) strain, and 5 (3–6) for the B strain. 
This protocol prospectively allowed for a superiority analysis 
in the event that the primary objective of GMT non-inferiority 
was met. The GMT ratio of aTIV to TIV was evaluated, with 
greater margins than the non-inferiority cutoff of 0.67. Lower 
bounds of the 95% CIs for all 3 aTIV:TIV vaccine ratios were 
>2, showing that the immunogenicity elicited by aTIV was 
superior to that of TIV for the 3 vaccine strains tested (Fig. 2). 
Analysis of GMTs by age subgroups showed that they were 
higher with aTIV than with TIV in all 3 groups and for all 3 vac- 
cine strains (Table 3). The GMT vaccine group ratios across all 3 
strains were largest in the youngest (6–<18 months) age sub- 
group and smallest in the oldest (36–<72 months) age subgroup. 
At 21 days after the last vaccination, the seroconversion rate 
following vaccination with aTIV met the non-inferiority criteria 
for all 3 virus strains in the overall population (Fig. 3). When 
analyzed by age, the seroconversion rate was greater for aTIV

than for TIV in all 3 groups, for all 3 strains. The difference 
between the 2 vaccines was particularly pronounced for the B 
strain (Table 4). The proportion of children achieving HI titers 
(cid:1)40, and the more stringent HI titer assessments, (cid:1)110, and 
(cid:1)330, 21 days after the last vaccination was higher for aTIV than 
for TIV, for all 3 virus strains and the 95% CIs did not overlap 
for the A(H1N1) and B strains (Fig. 4). When immunogenicity 
for the aTIV was analyzed separately in children who were vac- 
cine-na€ıve (not received (cid:1)2 doses of seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine 
since 1 July 2010) and non-na€ıve (received (cid:1)2 doses of seasonal 
inﬂuenza vaccine since 1 July 2010), vaccine status appeared to 
have little effect on the response for all 3 strains. GMTs for the 
aTIV were of a similar magnitude for the 2 groups, with larger 
geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for the vaccine-na€ıve than for the 
non-na€ıve group. For the aTIV, 
the proportion of children 
achieving HI titers (cid:1)40, (cid:1)110, and (cid:1)330 was also similar for 
vaccine-na€ıve and non-na€ıve, for all 3 strains and at all 3 thresh- 
olds. For the TIV, vaccine status did appear to inﬂuence GMTs 
as they were higher for the non-na€ıve than for the na€ıve group. 
GMRs varied by strain for the TIV; the GMR was larger for the 
non-na€ıve than for the na€ıve group for the A(H1N1) strain, while 
the reverse was true for the A(H3N2) strain. The GMRs were 
strain similar for the 2 groups for the B strain. For the TIV, the 
proportion of children achieving HI titers (cid:1)40, (cid:1)110, and (cid:1)330 
was higher in the non-na€ıve than in the na€ıve group for all 3 
strains. These differences were particularly pronounced at the 
highest threshold for A(H1N1) and A(H3N2).

(n D 137). In vaccine-na€ıve children aged 6 to <36 months, the 
proportion experiencing any solicited AEs after any vaccination 
was higher in the group that received aTIV (74%) than in those 
who received TIV (59%). In addition, this difference between 
the proportions decreased from the ﬁrst vaccination to the sec- 
ond vaccination (Table 5A). The most common solicited local 
and systemic events in vaccine-na€ıve children aged 6 to 
<36 months were injection-site tenderness (aTIV 45%; TIV 
32%) and irritability (aTIV 37%; TIV 25%), respectively. The 
proportion of non-na€ıve 
children aged 6–<36 months 
experiencing any solicited AE was higher with aTIV than with 
TIV (Table 5A). The most common solicited local and systemic 
events in this group were injection-site tenderness (aTIV 41%; 
TIV 19%) and diarrhea (aTIV 14%; TIV 27%), respectively. 
In the 36–<72 months age group, the number of vaccine- 
na€ıve children was too small 
for any meaningful analysis 
(Table 5B). In the non-na€ıve group aged 36 to <72 months, 
slightly more children in the TIV group compared with the aTIV 
group experienced any event, which is likely to result from a dif- 
ference in the rate of local events (Table 5B). The most common 
solicited local and systemic events in the non-na€ıve group aged 
36 to <72 months were injection-site pain (aTIV 32%; TIV 40%) 
and change in eating habits (aTIV 18%; TIV 8%), respectively. 
The majority of solicited local and systemic AEs in both age 
groups were of mild or moderate intensity. Severe injection-site 
pain was reported for 3 children only; 2 aged 6 to <36 months 
(1 vaccine-na€ıve and 1 non-na€ıve) and 1 aged 36 to <72 months 
(vaccine non-na€ıve), all had received aTIV. In vaccine-na€ıve chil- 
dren aged 6 to <36 months severe solicited systemic reactions 
were reported for 3 who received aTIV (irritability n D 1 and 
diarrhea n D 2) and 5 who received TIV (persistent crying,

cited systemic reactions were reported for 2 non-na€ıve children 
aged 36 to <72 months only (chills and myalgia, both n D 1) 
and both had received aTIV. No severe systemic reactions were 
reported for non-na€ıve children aged 6 to <36 months or for vac- 
cine-na€ıve children aged 36 to <72 months. 
The rate of unsolicited AEs reported for children (aged 6 to 
<72 months) was of a similar magnitude for aTIV and TIV, in 
both those who were vaccination-na€ıve (45% and 38%, respec- 
tively) and those who were non-na€ıve (14% and 9%, respectively) 
(Table 6). The most commonly reported unsolicited AE was 
nasopharyngitis for aTIV (22%) and pharyngitis (14%) for TIV, 
in vaccine-na€ıve children. In non-na€ıve children nasopharyngitis 
was the most commonly reported unsolicited AE for both aTIV 
and TIV (both 3%). The proportion of children that experienced 
medically attended AEs (MAAEs) was comparable between the 
vaccine groups for both the na€ıve and non-na€ıve groups, with 
far fewer being reported by non-na€ıve children (Table 6). No 
deaths, no serious adverse events (SAEs), and no AEs leading to 
premature withdrawal were reported (Table 6). 
Discussion 
The increased risk of inﬂuenza infection in children, compared 
with healthy adults, has prompted many countries, including 
those in North America, to incorporate annual inﬂuenza vaccina- 
tions into their healthcare programs, as recommended by the 
WHO.7 The currently available TIVs elicit a sub-optimal immune 
response in children, spurring the development of vaccines with 
adjuvants such as AS03 or MF59, which stimulate more robust 
antibody production against the inﬂuenza antigens.

The results from this study show that the aTIV was non- 
inferior to the TIV for all 3 vaccine strains tested in healthy 
children aged 6–<72 months in Mexico, during the 2014–2015 
season. The magnitude of the GMT ratios shows that the aTIV 
has a superior immune response than that of TIV against all 3 
virus strains tested. These ﬁndings support those of previous 
studies of aTIV in children that have shown higher immune

AE, adverse event; aTIV, adjuvanted trivalent inﬂuenza vaccine; SAE, serious 

responses, compared with TIV.11,12 These ﬁndings are unlikely 
to be due to differences between the 2 brands of vaccine as they 
contained the same antigens at the same concentrations and 
similar excipients, as well as being administered in the same 
way. Therefore, it is most likely to be the inclusion of the MF59 
adjuvant in the vaccine that improved the immune response of 
the aTIV compared with the TIV. 
While efﬁcacy of the adjuvanted vaccine has been shown pre- 
viously, with a relative efﬁcacy versus TIV of 75% (95% CI: 
55–87)12 the superiority of the adjuvanted vaccine over non- 
adjuvanted vaccines has not been demonstrated before. 
Although 2 previous studies assessing aTIV in young children 
have shown high immune responses, neither have shown superi- 
ority of aTIV over TIV.11,12 One study11 failed to meet the pre- 
speciﬁed criteria to show superiority, which required GMT and 
seroconversion rates to reach statistical signiﬁcance: although 
the superiority criteria for GMT were met, those for seroconver- 
sion were not. The second study12 could not demonstrate superi- 
ority as this was not prospectively included in the study design. 
Nonetheless, the consistently higher GMTs reported with aTIV 
in both studies, against both homologous and heterologous 
inﬂuenza strains, and the superior immunogenicity of aTIV 
compared with TIV in the present study underscore the immu- 
nologic beneﬁt derived from the MF59 adjuvant. 
In this study, HI titers were higher in the aTIV group than 
the TIV group, for (cid:1)40, (cid:1)110, and (cid:1)330 thresholds, and for all 


3 strains. Assessment of HI titers (cid:1)110 and (cid:1)330 is important 
because the use of HI (cid:1)40 as a correlate of protection is based 
on studies in adults and has been shown to be inappropriate 
for evaluating responses in children, based on antibody titers 
against H3N2.20 Antibody titers of (cid:1)110 for H3N2 have been 
shown to predict a 50% clinical protection rate, which is similar 
to the rate for titers of (cid:1)40 in adults. However, the (cid:1)330 cutoff 
was shown to predict an 80% clinical protection rate for H3N2, 
which may offer a public health beneﬁt.20 
The robust immunogenicity demonstrated by the aTIV is 
important for the pediatric population as children tend to have a 
poor response to non-adjuvanted TIV while experiencing the 
highest attack rates for inﬂuenza and a high burden of morbid- 
ity.2,4 In Mexico, the H1N1 and H3N2 strains are known to be 
endemic and were identiﬁed as the predominant circulating 
strains during the 2013–2014 winter.5 Furthermore, a recent 
sero-analysis has shown that, despite high transmission rates of A 
(H1N1) during the 2009 pandemic in Mexico, a large proportion 
of the population, including children, have no or low levels of A 
(H1N1)pdm09 neutralizing antibodies, and so they remain sus- 
ceptible to infection.21 Together these ﬁndings illustrate the need 
for a vaccine that induces a strong immune response in children. 
In Mexico, the inﬂuenza vaccination program is based on the use 
of TIVs, therefore the aTIV assessed in this study may be a useful 
addition as it has shown superior immunogenicity to a TIV. 
Cross-reactive immune responses can also be beneﬁcial in 
children when vaccine strains and circulating viruses are mis- 
matched. Heterologous responses were not assessed in the 
study reported here, but it is highly likely that the pattern of 
increased cross-reactive responses elicited by the MF59-adju- 
vanted vaccine, as reported in other prior pediatric studies,11,12 
could also have occurred in the children included in this study. 
The results from this study show that the aTIV was well toler- 
ated, supporting inclusion of this vaccine in pediatric seasonal 
inﬂuenza vaccination programs. The proportions of children 
experiencing solicited AEs were higher for aTIV than they were 
for TIV, but no AEs led to withdrawal from the study. The pat- 
tern of unsolicited AEs was similar for aTIV and TIV and no 
SAEs were reported. Overall, the safety results described here are 
aligned with those from previous reports,11,12 with no new emer- 
gent concerns. 
AS03 is another proprietary adjuvant used in inﬂuenza vac- 
cines to enhance the immune response. MF59 and AS03 are 
both oil-based adjuvants that contain squalene, but a-tocopherol 
is also present in AS03,22 but not MF59.14 The AS03-adjuvanted 
monovalent pandemic (H1N1) vaccine in children has been 
shown to be effective in preventing inﬂuenza-related hospitaliza- 
tion23,24 and to be clinically superior to a non-adjuvanted pan- 
demic monovalent vaccine.25 An early study of an AS03- 
adjuvanted TIV has shown that this vaccine is also immuno- 
genic.26 Safety analyses have shown that while the AS03-adju- 
vanted monovalent vaccine is generally well tolerated, there may 
be an increased risk of febrile seizures, although the risk was less 
than that associated with contracting pandemic inﬂuenza,27 and 
there may also be an increased risk of narcolepsy,28 which has 
been tentatively associated with a-tocopherol.29 These results 
support the use of non-aluminum based adjuvants to enhance 
the immune response to inﬂuenza vaccines and also illustrate 
how the safety proﬁle of vaccines can vary. 
This study has some limitations. The study is small and there 
were few older children (aged 36–<72 months) in the vaccine- 
na€ıve group, making sub-analyses of this population challenging. 
However, this is to be expected as most children will have 
received at least 1 vaccination by this age, and so it is reﬂective of 
the prevailing clinical practice. In addition, many children were 
excluded from immunogenicity study analyses owing to non- 
compliance with the blood draw schedule. This non-compliance 
was an unavoidable consequence of a concurrent national vacci- 
nation campaign, which was initiated by the government after 
more than half the subjects in this study had been enrolled. 
Assessment of 
the immune responses against heterologous 
strains in this population would also have provided useful addi- 
tional data describing the breadth of immunogenicity of these 
vaccines. One strength of this study is that the inclusion and 
analysis of both vaccine-na€ıve and non-na€ıve children makes it 
more reﬂective of actual clinical practice. The randomized, con- 
trolled, observer-blind design of the study has allowed robust 
analysis of the data and hence clear conclusions to be drawn. 

The aTIV was highly immunogenic and well tolerated in 
healthy children in Mexico. The HI titers elicited show that 
the aTIV is not only non-inferior to TIV with respect to 
GMT and seroconversion rates, but also that the GMT data 
for aTIV are superior to TIV. Overall, these ﬁndings suggest 
that the aTIV may be a beneﬁcial addition to pediatric vac- 
cination programs. 


This was an observer-blind, multicenter, randomized Phase III trial 
that assessed the safety and immunogenicity of vaccination with 
FLUAD, an aTIV, compared with an unadjuvanted TIV 
(Fluzone(cid:1)) in healthy children in Mexico. The trial was conducted 
at 3 centers in Mexico, between 23 October 2014 and 20 May 2015. 
The primary objectives were: to demonstrate non-inferiority 
of aTIV to TIV, measured by GMTs and to assess the safety of 
the aTIV and TIV. Secondary objectives included: assessment of 
non-inferiority of aTIV to TIV by seroconversion; evaluation of 
immunogenicity of aTIV and TIV by GMRs and the proportion 
of children with HI titers (cid:1)40, (cid:1)110, and (cid:1)330; and if non-infe- 
riority was established, to evaluate the GMT ratio of aTIV to 
TIV using margins greater than the non-inferiority cutoff. 
Children 
Healthy male and female children aged 6–<72 months whose 
parent(s) or guardian(s) had voluntarily given written informed 
consent and who could comply with the trial procedures were 
included in the study. Children and their parent(s) or guardian 
(s) also had to agree to have serum samples stored for future 
testing (Table S1). 
Major exclusion criteria included: any progressive, unstable, 
or uncontrolled clinical conditions or a fatal prognosis; hyper- 
sensitivity to any vaccine components; a history of seizures, 
severe neurological disorders or Guillain-Barr(cid:1)e syndrome; 
abnormal functioning of the immune system; contraindication 
of intramuscular (IM) vaccination; or any clinical condition or 
planned procedure that might interfere with the trial schedule 
or results. Receipt of inﬂuenza (within 6 months) or other vac- 
cines (within 14 days) also precluded enrollment (Table S1). 
Children were stratiﬁed 1:1:1 by age group; 6–<18 months, 
18–<36 months, and 36–<72 months and were assigned ran- 
domly 1:1 within the strata to receive vaccination with aTIV 
(FLUAD) or the TIV (Fluzone(cid:1)), according to the prescribing 
information, on Day 1 (Fig. 1). Centers for conducting this 
study were selected based on their experience in clinical 
research and their access to a pediatric population. At each cen- 
ter, randomization was assigned based on the given subject 
number, using a validated web-based system, which automati- 
cally generated the group assignment in the speciﬁed ratio. 
Previous inﬂuenza vaccination status for eligible children 
was deﬁned as: “vaccine non-na€ıve” – children who had 
received 2 or more doses of seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine since 1 
July 2010; “vaccine-na€ıve” – children who had not received 2 or 
more doses of seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine since 1 July 2010. 


The diary card was completed daily, reporting solicited local and 
systemic AEs from Day 1 to Day 7, following each vaccination. For 
non-na€ıve children, all unsolicited AEs, along with any treatments, 
were recorded from Day 1 to Day 22. In na€ıve children, all unsolic- 
ited AEs, along with any treatments, were recorded from Day 1 to 
Day 29. Following the second vaccination, the diary card was com- 
pleted for a further 6 days and unsolicited AEs were recorded for a 
further 21 days. Solicited local reactions included: ecchymosis, ery- 
thema, induration, swelling; and tenderness in children aged 6– 
<36 months; or pain in children 36–<72 months. Local reactions 
were categorized as: none (0 mm), any ((cid:1)1 mm). Systemic reac- 
tions included: change in eating habits, vomiting, diarrhea, and 
fever (cid:1)38(cid:3)C. In children aged 6–<36 months, sleepiness, persis- 
tent crying, irritability were also included, while in children aged 
36–<72 months, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and fatigue 
were evaluated. The severity of all AEs was classiﬁed as mild, mod- 
erate, or severe by the investigator, based on speciﬁc criteria for 
solicited AEs, and the relationship of an AE to the study treatment 
was deﬁned by the investigator as not, possibly, or probably related. 
SAEs were recorded by the investigator and assessed for the rela- 
tionship to the vaccine. 


The aTIV (batch numbers: #IA142503 and IA142501) and the 
comparator TIV (batch number: 
IAU1189AC) contained 
(cid:1)15mg HA of A/H1N1 (California/2009), A/H3N2 (Texas/ 
2012), and B inﬂuenza (Massachusetts/2012), according to the 
WHO recommendations for 2014/2015. Both vaccines were 
administered IM; in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh to sub- 
jects aged <36 months, or in the deltoid muscle of the (prefera- 
bly) non-dominant arm to subjects aged >36 months. 
Children aged 6–<36 months received a 0.25 mL dose of vac- 
cine and those aged (cid:1)36 months received a 0.5 mL dose of vac- 
cine, as recommended by medical guidelines. Children who were 
inﬂuenza non-na€ıve received 1 vaccination with either aTIV or 
TIV on Day 1. Children who were vaccine-na€ıve received 2 vac- 
cinations with either aTIV or TIV on Days 1 and 29. 

GMTs were assessed by HI assay from blood samples (each 
approximately 5 mL) taken on Day 1 and on Day 22 for non- 
na€ıve children and on Day 1 and Day 50 for na€ıve children. HI 
titers were also used to calculate the proportion of children 
achieving seroconversion on Day 22 for non-na€ıve and Day 50 
for na€ıve children for all 3 vaccine strains and GMRs from 
baseline. The proportion of children with a HI titer (cid:1)40, (cid:1)110, 
and (cid:1)330 on Day 1 and on Day 22 for non-na€ıve children and 
on Day 1 and Day 50 for na€ıve children was also assessed. 
The HI assay is a standard, widely used measure based on 
the binding of anti-hemagglutinin antibodies blocking the 
interaction between inﬂuenza viruses and red blood cells. HI 
assays were conducted by Novartis or a designated laboratory 
and, very brieﬂy, involved: a standard number of red blood cells 
were incubated with serially diluted sera in the presence of viral 
isolates, and red blood cell agglutination recorded. 
Solicited local and systemic AEs were collected using a diary 
and unsolicited AEs were collected through spontaneous reporting. 
Children were recruited from central and southern areas of the 
country, as well as the metropolitan area of Mexico City, mean- 
ing the sample was representative of the general population. 
Sample size was determined based on previous trial data to 
demonstrate that at 21 days after the last vaccination, the GMT 
ratios of aTIV to TIV were non-inferior, with the lower limit of 
the 2-sided 95% CI above 0.67 (¡0.176 on log10 scale) for each 
vaccine strain (1-sided a D 2.5%). With 126 subjects per group, 
a single test has a power of 92% for H1N1 and >99% for H3N2 
and B. As there were 3 comparisons, the resulting power was 
90%. Therefore, to account for subject withdrawals, 141 chil- 
dren were recruited to each group. 
The per protocol set was used for all the immunogenicity 
analyses. The primary analyses were repeated using the full 
analysis set as a measure of sensitivity. Safety endpoints were 
reported by vaccine group and included: the proportion of chil- 
dren reporting solicited local and systemic AEs from Day 1 to 
Day 7 following each vaccination; the proportion of children 
reporting unsolicited AEs from Day 1 to Day 22 for non-na€ıve 
children and from Day 1 to Day 50 for na€ıve children; and the 
proportion of children with MAAEs, AEs leading to with- 
drawal, and SAEs from Day 1 to Day 22 for non-na€ıve children 
and from Day 1 to Day 50 for na€ıve children. 
Immunogenicity endpoints, including GMTs, seroconver- 
sion, GMRs, and HI titers were reported by vaccine group 
on Days 1 and 22 for non-na€ıve children and on Days 1 and 
50 for na€ıve children. Seroconversion was deﬁned as HI (cid:1)40 
subject with a pre-vaccination HI titer <10; a minimum 
4-fold increase HI titer for children with a pre-vaccination 
HI titer (cid:1)10, on Day 22 for non-na€ıve children or Day 50 
for na€ıve children. GMRs were calculated as Day 22/Day 1 
for non-na€ıve children or Day 50/Day1 for na€ıve children. 
GMTs and associated CIs were determined using analysis 
of covariance with factors for vaccine group, age group, 
na€ıve/non-na€ıve, and center. 


The primary objective was determined to have been met if 
the GMT ratios of aTIV to TIV 21 days after the last vaccina- 
tion were demonstrated to be non-inferior, with the lower 
limit of the 2-sided 95% CI being above 0.67 for each vaccine 
strain. Non-inferiority of seroconversion for aTIV compared 
with TIV would be shown if the lower limit of the 95% CI 
around the difference in seroconversion rates between aTIV 
and TIV was higher than ¡10%. If non-inferiority of GMT 
ratios 21 days after the last vaccination was demonstrated, 
then “higher non-inferiority”/superiority was tested. The supe- 
riority margin would be increased by 0.01 unit (on the log 
scale) and superiority would be demonstrated if the lower 
limit of the 2-sided 95% CI was at least equal to the margin. 
Sample size was calculated based on data from previous stud- 
ies. A single test with 126 children in each vaccine group has 
a power of 92% for H1N1 and >99% for H3N2 and B strains. 
Therefore, the overall power is 90%. To account for dropouts, 
141 children were planned to be included in each group. 

This study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical 
Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by 
local ethics committees.
