Efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety evaluation of an 
MF59-adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza virus vaccine 
compared with non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in 
children: a multicentre, randomised controlled, 
observer-blinded, phase 3 trial 

Summary 
Background Young children have immature immune systems and respond poorly to standard influenza vaccines. 
The oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant MF59 can increase antigen uptake, macrophage recruitment, lymph node 
migration, and avidity to influenza virus. Therefore, we aimed to assess the relative efficacy, immunogenicity, and 
safety of an MF59-adjuvanted, quadrivalent, inactivated (subunit) influenza vaccine (aIIV4) compared with a 
US-licensed non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in children. 
Methods We did a multicentre, randomised controlled, observer-blinded, phase 3 trial of 146 sites including hospitals, 
clinics, and clinician offices in nine countries over two influenza seasons. We included children of either sex aged 
6 months through 5 years. We stratified eligible participants and randomly assigned them (1:1), using a block size of four, 
to receive either aIIV4 or non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (ie, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV3] 
or quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV4]). We masked participants, parents or guardians, and outcome 
assessors to the administered vaccine. Designated personnel who were not masked administered aIIV4 in both seasons, 
or IIV3 in season one and IIV4 in season two. All vaccinations were administered intramuscularly. Children aged 
6 through 35 months received one or two 0·25 mL doses, whereas those aged 3 through 5 years received one or two doses 
of 0·5 mL. The number of doses was dependent on previous vaccination status: vaccine-naive participants received a total 
of two doses of study vaccine, the first on day 1 and the second on day 29, whereas non-naive participants received only 
one dose on day 1. The primary outcome was relative vaccine efficacy assessed by RT-PCR-confirmed influenza due to 
any influenza strain in the overall study population and in prespecified age and dose subgroups. Immunogenicity against 
homologous and heterologous strains of influenza and safety were also measured. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01964989. 
Findings Between Nov 3, 2013, and March 5, 2014 (season one), and between Sept 30, 2014, and March 29, 2015 
(season two), 10 644 participants were enrolled in this study. Of these participants, 10 612 were vaccinated (n=5338 
with aIIV4 and n=5274 with comparator). Relative vaccine efficacy was not different between aIIV4 and the comparator 
vaccines in the overall study population (relative vaccine efficacy –0·67, 95% CI –19·81 to 15·41). The relative vaccine 
efficacy in the 6 through 23-month subgroup was significantly greater for aIIV4 than for the comparator vaccine 
(relative vaccine efficacy 31·37, 95% CI 3·14–51·38). aIIV4 elicited superior immunogenic response compared with 
the comparator for all four vaccine strains (geometric mean titre ratios 1·91 [95% CI 1·8–2·0] for A/H1N1, 
1·71 [1·6–1·8] for A/H3N2, 2·19 [2·0–2·4] for B/Yamagata, and 2·27 [2·0–2·6] for B/Victoria) and three heterologous 
strains (1·94 [1·6–2·3] for A/H3N2, 2·17 [1·8–2·6] for B/Yamagata, and 2·12 [1·6–2·7] for B/Victoria) in participants 
aged 6 months through 5 years. The highest geometric mean titre ratios were observed in participants aged 6 through 
23 months. Safety profiles were similar but more frequent solicited adverse events were reported with aIIV4 than with 
the comparator (3748 [73%] of 5138 vs 3242 [64%] of 5056). 
Interpretation Although there was no additional benefit of aIIV4 compared with the US-licensed non-adjuvanted 
influenza vaccines in the overall study population, in the youngest and most vulnerable population of children in this 
trial, aIIV4 provided greater protection against influenza than a non-adjuvanted vaccine when assessed in this 
prespecified age group of 6 through 23 months. Additional clinical benefit was also apparent early after first 
vaccination in vaccine-naive participants aged 6 months through 5 years. Finally, aIIV4 and comparator had similar 
efficacy and vaccine safety profiles in children aged 6 months through 5 years.

Introduction 
Children are at increased risk for influenza-induced 
morbidity and mortality,1,2 and they have a major role in 
the transmission of influenza during epidemics.3,4 In an 
average year, influenza affects approximately 13% of 
children younger than 5 years, or roughly 90 million 
children worldwide.5,6 Influenza also accounts for 10% of 
paediatric admissions to hospital for respiratory illnesses 
and 2–7% of deaths in children younger than 5 years 
annually, with the highest percentages among those 
younger than 2 years.7,8 
Vaccinating children against influenza not only directly 
benefits children themselves but also helps prevent the 
spread of influenza.9 Unfortunately, currently licensed 
trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3) often do 
not elicit robust antibody responses in young children, 
particularly against B strains. Meanwhile, two separate 
B lineages (B/Victoria/2/87 and B/Yamagata/16/88) have 
co-circulated during most influenza seasons since the 
1980s.10,11 Quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines 
(IIV4) were developed containing both influenza B 
lineages and might offer a potential advantage over 
IIV3.12,13 
The oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant MF59 (Seqirus, 
formerly the influenza business of Novartis Vaccines and 
Diagnostics) can increase antigen uptake, macrophage 
recruitment, and lymph node migration.14 MF59 also 
increases the avidity of antibody binding to influenza 
virus.15 MF59-adjuvanted IIV3 (Fluad) showed increased 
efficacy and antibody responses to homologous and 
heterologous strains compared with non-adjuvanted 
IIV3 in children.16,17 An MF59-adjuvanted, quadrivalent, 
inactivated (subunit) influenza vaccine (aIIV4) con- 
taining strains from the two influenza A strains and both 
the B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineages should similarly 
enhance vaccine efficacy in children. Therefore, in this 
phase 3 trial, we assessed the relative efficacy, immuno- 
genicity, and safety of aIIV4 compared with a US-licensed 
non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in children. 
Methods 
Study design and participants 
We did a multicentre, randomised controlled, observer- 
blinded, phase 3 trial of 146 sites including hospitals, 
clinics, and clinician offices in Finland, the USA, Canada, 
Italy, Poland, Spain, Philippines, Thailand, and Taiwan. 
We did the study over two influenza seasons. In the 
northern hemisphere, the end of an influenza season was 
considered as June 30, whereas in the tropical nations 
(Philippines and Thailand) the season end was Oct 31. 
The study was approved by either a central or local 
institutional review board or ethics committee, and was 
done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and 
the International Council for Harmonisation Guideline 
for Good Clinical Practice. 
We included children of either sex aged 6 months 
through 5 years who were healthy or at high risk of 
complications from influenza. We excluded children 
who had any medical condition meeting the definition of 
an adverse event of special interest (appendix), any 
seizure condition, or any fatal condition. The appendix 
lists all inclusion and exclusion criteria. We obtained 
written informed consent from the parents or legal 
guardians, or both, of all participants before enrolment. 
Randomisation and masking 
We stratified eligible participants according to site, 
vaccine dose, risk status for influenza complications 





Evidence before this study 
We searched PubMed on Sept 5, 2017, using the search terms 
“quadrivalent influenza vaccine” and “children” with no 
restrictions to language or dates. Our search revealed 
104 articles published between 2006 and 2017. Of these 
articles, ten were classified as clinical trials assessing the efficacy, 
immunogenicity, or safety of a quadrivalent vaccine in a 
paediatric population. None of these studies examined 
adjuvanted vaccines. We did a second PubMed search using the 
terms “adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine” and 
“children”, which identified 25 clinical trials published between 
2004 and 2015. One of these studies examined the relative 
efficacy of MF59-adjuvanted vaccine versus a non-adjuvanted 
comparator in children. In that study, adjuvanted trivalent 
inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3) was significantly more 
efficacious than non-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza 
vaccine (IIV3) against laboratory-confirmed influenza in 
children aged 6 months through 5 years and in a subgroup aged 
6 through 23 months. 
Added value of this study 
This study was done mainly during a season in which there 
was a mismatch between the recommended vaccine 
A/H3N2 strain and the predominantly circulating 
A/H3N2 virus strain. Despite the mismatch, aIIV4 was 
significantly more efficacious than the non-adjuvanted 
vaccines in preventing influenza in children aged 6 through 
23 months. 
Implications of all the available evidence 
Young children, particularly those younger than 2 years, have 
immature immune systems that respond poorly to standard 
influenza vaccines. In this study, aIIV4 offered an additional 
benefit over currently licensed influenza vaccines in this age 
group, which should be considered in public health 
recommendations. However, no significant difference in vaccine 
efficacy was shown for the overall study population 
aged 6 months through 5 years. 
(see the appendix for these definitions), and historical 
influenza vaccination status. For historical vaccination 
status, only participants who reported 
than 
two doses of seasonal 
influenza vaccine since 
July 1, 2010, were considered vaccine naive. Vaccination 
history was based on previous documentation 
(eg, a vaccination card) or through the parent’s or legal 
guardian’s verbal recall if no such documentation was 
available. 

Additionally, we used a web-based 
technology system 
interactive 
to randomly assign 
response 
participants (1:1), using a block size of four, to receive 
either aIIV4 or non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza 
vaccine (ie, IIV3 or IIV4). Blocks were dynamically 
assigned to the site strata, from a central block pool, 
upon the first participant enrolment into the strata. 
Subsequent participants enrolled into the site strata 
were allocated to the next available treatment group in 
the randomisation block. Randomisation lists were 
generated by Oracle randomisation statisticians and 
verified by the sponsor’s statisticians. Treatment lists 
were generated by Fisher Clinical Services and verified 
by the sponsor’s statisticians and the Clinical supply 
department. 
Site-specific blinding procedures were documented 
before the study start. Therefore, we masked all site 
personnel except those administering the vaccine 
(ie, the nurse or physician), for which they had no role 
in the assessment of the participants in the trial and 
were instructed not to reveal the identity of the study 
vaccines to the participants, parents or guardians, and 
investigators or study nurses involved in the monitoring 
or conduct of the study, except in an emergency. We also 
masked the participants and parents or guardians to the 
vaccine administered; for example, we requested them 
to look the other way upon vaccination or by shielding 
the syringe. 
For the immunogenicity subgroup, we randomly 
selected participants in a one-to-one ratio from the 
two vaccine study groups, including both healthy 
participants and those at high risk of 
influenza 
complications. We also stratified the immunogenicity 
subgroup by country, dose cohort, and vaccine status. 
Procedures 
We used aIIV4 (Seqirus, Rosia, Italy) and non-adjuvanted 
inactivated influenza vaccine (ie, IIV3 or IIV4, both of 
which are split virion type licensed products [Fluzone, 
Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA, USA]). Fluzone IIV3 was 
used as the comparator in season one because Fluzone 
IIV4 did not receive approval from the US Food and 
Drug Administration for use in children aged 6 months 
or older until June, 2013, and insufficient amounts of 
IIV4 were available the first season. Fluzone IIV4 was 
used as the comparator in season two. The aIIV4 used in 
in season 
seasons one and two, and IIV4 used 
two contained a total haemagglutinin (HA) concentration 


of 60 µg in the 0·5 mL dose and 30 µg in the 0·25 mL 
dose, which consisted of 15 µg or 7·5 µg (depending on 
dose) of HA from each influenza strain as recommended 
by WHO 
the northern hemisphere 2013–14 
and 2014–15 seasons: A/H1N1 (A/California/7/2009 
(A/Texas/50/2012), 
pdm09-like 
B/Yamagata (B/Massachusetts/2/2012), and B/Victoria 
(B/Brisbane/60/2008). The IIV3 comparator used in 
season one contained 15 µg of HA in the 0·5 mL dose or 
7·5 µg in the 0·25 mL dose from A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 
as well as the B/Yamagata lineage, for a total of 45 µg in 
the 0·5 mL dose or 22·5 µg in the 0·25 mL dose of HA in 
the vaccine. 

Children aged 6 through 35 months received one or 
two 0·25 mL doses, whereas those aged 3 through 5 years 
received one or two doses of 0·5 mL. The number of 
doses was dependent on previous vaccination status: 
vaccine-naive participants received a total of two doses of 
study vaccine, the first on day 1 and the second on day 29, 
whereas non-naive participants received only one dose 
on day 1. All vaccinations were administered intra- 
muscularly in the deltoid, except when the child did not 
have sufficient deltoid mass in which case injections 
were administered in the anterolateral thigh. 
We did active surveillance for influenza-like illness 
weekly via telephone contact or text message, or both, 
or during planned clinic visits for 180 days after last 
vaccination or until the end of the influenza season, 
whichever was longer. Parents or guardians of the study 
participants were instructed to report symptoms of 
influenza-like illness to the study site and schedule a 
clinic visit 
for nasopharyngeal swab collection, 
preferably within 3 days or at least within 6 days after a 
participant exhibited a body temperature of 37·8°C or 
more and at least one of the following respiratory 
symptoms: cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, or 
runny nose. RT-PCR was used to confirm influenza 
infection from naso pharyngeal swab samples, which 
were also cultured in parallel. The cultured virus was 
analysed for antigenic characterisation by the University 
of Rochester Vaccine Evaluation Unit (Rochester, NY, 
USA) and by Viroclinics Biosciences BV (Rotterdam, 
Netherlands). RT-PCR and culture tests were done at 
Focus Diagnostics Clinical Trials (San Juan Capistrano, 
CA, USA). 

typing was determined using 
haemagglutination inhibition or microneutralisation 
assays. For some A/H3N2 isolates, haemagglutination 
inhibition was done with ferret antisera raised against 
an exclusively cell-grown A/H3N2 and an egg- 
propagated A/H3N2 virus reference standard. For 
A/H3N2 isolates that did not bind red blood cells but 
could be grown, a standard microneutralisation assay 
was done using egg-propagated A/H3N2 to both raise 
ferret antisera and to serve as the reference standard.18 
Matched strains were those with less than eight-fold 
difference in titre and unmatched strains were those 



with eight-fold difference or more in titre compared 
with the reference standard. 


We assessed antibody responses with haemagglu- 
tination inhibition assays using serum samples collected 
before vaccination 
for non-vaccine-naive 
participants and days 1 and 29 for vaccine-naive 
participants) and 21 days after the last vaccination 
(day 22 for non-vaccine-naive participants and day 50 for 
vaccine-naive participants). We also collected samples for 
haemag glutination 
titre measurement 
inhibition 
6 months after the last vaccination (day 181 for non- 
vaccine-naive participants and day 209 for vaccine-naive 
participants). Strains 
for heterologous 
testing were A/Brisbane/59/2007 for A/H1N1, A/Hong 
Kong/4801/2014 for A/H3N2, B/Phuket/3073/2013 for 
B/Yamagata, and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 for B/Victoria. 

From 6 h to day 7 after each vaccination, the 
participant’s parent or guardian, or both, was instructed 
to keep a daily record of specific local and systemic 
adverse events. These solicited adverse events included 
tenderness, erythema, induration, and ecchymosis at 
the injection site, as well as irritability, sleepiness, 
changed eating habits, vomiting, diarrhoea, chills, fever, 
and the use of antipyretics or analgesics for prevention 
or treatment of pain or fever, or both. Other adverse 
events and associated medications were also tracked 
from the day of vaccination until 21 days after the last 
vaccination. Safety surveillance was done from the first 
vaccination and continued until the termination visit, 
which occurred on day 366 for non-vaccine-naive 
for vaccine-naive 
participants and on day 390 
participants. Surveillance included adverse events of 
special interest, which specifically focused on potentially 
immune-mediated diseases (the appendix summarises 
the full list of medical concepts), new-onset chronic 
diseases, serious adverse events, and events leading to 
study withdrawal. 
Outcomes 
The primary outcome was the relative vaccine efficacy of 
aIIV4 versus non-adjuvanted vaccine (ie, IIV3 or IIV4) 
based on RT-PCR-confirmed influenza cases occurring 
between 21 days and 180 days (inclusive) after the last 
vaccination or until the end of the influenza season, 
whichever was longer, in participants aged 6 months 
through 5 years. Early vaccine efficacy was assessed as the 
relative vaccine efficacy at 7 days or more and 14 days or 
more after the first but before the second dose of vaccine in 
vaccine-naive participants as well as at 7 days or more and 
21 days or less after the last vaccination, in all participants.

Efficacy determinations in the first season were based on 
lineage 
A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B/Yamagata, the B 
common to aIIV4 and the IIV3 comparator. Children 
infected with B/Victoria from season one were not 
included in the efficacy analyses because this strain was 
absent from the comparator vaccine in season one. Season 
two efficacy assessments were made using all four virus 
strains. We assessed all efficacy outcomes for all 
participants in the following prespecified age and dose 
cohorts: 6 through 23 months, 0·25 mL dose (6 through 
35 months), and 0·5 mL dose (3 through 5 years). A post- 
hoc analysis assessed relative vaccine efficacy 
in 
participants aged 2 through 5 years, irrespective of dose. 
Secondary efficacy outcomes included culture-confirmed 
influenza regardless of antigenic match, and antigenically 
matched and unmatched strains in the same timeframe as 
the primary efficacy outcome. 

Secondary immunogenicity outcomes included assess- 
ment of geometric mean titres (GMT) at baseline, before 
first vaccination, and 3 weeks and 6 months after final 
vaccination 
In vaccine-naive 
participants who received two doses, immunogenicity 
was also assessed 4 weeks after first vaccination. The 
ratios of GMT values for aIIV4 versus non-adjuvanted 
vaccine were also determined at each timepoint. Data 
from 3 weeks after final vaccination in naive and 
non-naive participants were pooled. We pooled data from 
seasons one and two because the same strains were 
included in the vaccine. The vaccine-group difference in 
the percentage of those achieving seroconversion was 
assessed; seroconversion was defined as a post- 
vaccination haemagglutination inhibition titre of 1:40 
for participants who were negative at baseline 
(haemagglutination inhibition <1:10) or a minimum four- 
fold increase in haemagglutination inhibition titre for 
those who were positive at baseline (≥1:10). Antibody 
responses were also evaluated according to the Center for 
Biologics Evaluation and Research criteria (appendix). 
The proportion of participants with haemag glutination 
in hibition titres of 1:110 or more, 1:151 or more, 1:215 or 
more, 1:330 or more, and 1:629 or more was also evaluated 
at the same timepoints outlined above.19 Subgroup 
analyses were preplanned for the 
immunogenicity 
endpoints for the same age and dose cohorts as for 
efficacy. A post-hoc analysis was done for children 
aged 2 through 5 years. 
Safety and tolerability were assessed in terms of the 
percentage of participants with adverse events. Any 
other outcome or subgroup analyses as specified in the 
protocol but not listed here were not included in this 
manuscript. 
Statistical analysis 
Sample size and power considerations for the primary 
aIIV4 efficacy objective were based on data extracted 
from a previous efficacy study of adjuvanted IIV3 
(aIIV3) in paediatric participants.20 This study was 
planned with a group-sequential design. Assuming a 
relative vaccine efficacy of 36% and an influenza event 
rate of 2·50% in the non-adjuvanted comparator group, 
the sample size of approximately 8124 evaluable 
participants aged 6 months through 5 years for both 
vaccine groups, with a number of 323 influenza events, 
predicted about 97·5% power for the adjusted 2·02% 
level one-sided log-rank test for equality of survival

Assuming a 15% dropout of participants, approximately 
9558 participants were to be enrolled for each vaccine 
group. As per protocol, at a number of 323 RT-PCR- 
confirmed cases, a final analysis for efficacy was to be 
done. This number was reached at the interim analysis 
done by an independent data monitoring committee at 
the end of season two. Therefore, no further participants 
were enrolled in a subsequent season.

The efficacy full analysis set comprised all participants 
who received study vaccine and provided efficacy data. 
For the immunogenicity analyses, the full analysis set 
population included all participants who received study 
vaccine and who provided at least one evaluable serum 
sample both before (baseline) and after vaccination. The 
per-protocol set included all study participants and 
associated data from the full analysis set who were not 
excluded for reasons prespecified before unmasking. 
The safety analysis set included all participants who were 
exposed to the study vaccine and provided safety data. We 
did all statistical analyses using SAS (version 9.3). This 
study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT01964989.

Results 
Season one enrolment occurred between Nov 3, 2013, 
and March 5, 2014, and season two enrolment between 
Sept 30, 2014, and March 29, 2015. A total of 
10 644 participants were enrolled 
this study 
(1486 in 2013–14 [season one] and 9158 in 2014–15 
[season two]). Of these participants randomly assigned 
to the two groups, 5338 were vaccinated with aIIV4 and 
5274 were vaccinated with the comparator vaccine across 
the two seasons (figure 1). 2686 (25·2%) of 10 644 were

included all participants enrolled in season one and 1770

In both the efficacy and immunogenicity full analysis 
set, demographic and baseline characteristics were 
similar between vaccine groups, including the proportion 
of participants with baseline haemagglutination 
inhibition titres of less than 1:10 and 1:40 or more 
(table 1). The number of vaccine-naive participants with a 
baseline haemagglutination inhibition titre of less than 
1:10 against H3N2 was 451 (49%) of 922 participants who 
received aIIV4 and 443 (51%) of 866 who received the 
comparator (table 1). By contrast, the number of 
participants aged 6 through 23 months who had a 
baseline haema gglutination inhibition titre of less than 
1:10 against H3N2 was 282 (66%) of 428 for those who 
received aIIV4 versus 280 (66%) of 427 for those who 
received the comparator. In total, 2235 (84%) of 
2673 participants aged 6 through 23 months received two 
doses of vaccine versus 4642 (58%) of 7939 aged 2 through 
5 years. 
A total of 508 cases of first-occurrence RT-PCR- 
confirmed influenza occurred during the study; ten 
during season one and 498 during season two. There 
was no difference between aIIV4 and the comparator in 
the prevention of RT-PCR-confirmed 
in 
partici pants aged 6 months through 5 years (relative 
vaccine efficacy –0·67, 95% CI –19·81 to 15·41; table 2). 




Although there were differences in attack rate between 
the countries, there was no difference in relative vaccine 
efficacy by country (data not shown). Similar results 
were 
influenza 
regardless of antigenic match (table 2; appendix). 
Among participants with first-occurrence RT-PCR- 
confirmed influenza, 34 (0·8%) of 4521 participants 
from the aIIV4 group and 32 (0·7%) of 4494 from the 
comparator group had moderate-to-severe influenza, 
and the relative vaccine efficacy was –4·78 (95% CI 
–70·23 to 35·51; appendix). Using the antigenic typing 
assays, more than half of A/H3N2 strains from season 
two were determined to be antigenically distinct from 
egg-propagated A/Texas/50/2012, the H3N2 vaccine 
strain. 

In participants aged 6 through 23 months, the relative 
vaccine efficacy of aIIV4 against RT-PCR-confirmed 
influenza was significantly more than the comparator 
vaccine (31·37, 95% CI 3·14–51·38; table 3). Relative 
vaccine efficacy for aIIV4 was higher in those aged 
6 
culture-confirmed 
from any strain and culture-confirmed 
influenza 
matched cases than for the comparator, although 
differences were not significant (table 3). The exploratory

was 54·66 (95% CI 18·08–74·91) between 7 days after the 
first dose and the time of the second dose, and was 
70·56 (35·19–86·62) 14 days or more after the first dose 
until the second vaccination (table 4). Additionally, 
regardless of previous vaccination status, 
fewer 
participants who received aIIV4 were diagnosed with 
influenza between 7 days and 21 days after the last 
vaccination compared with the comparator (four vs 15; 
table 4). 

In the overall study population, aIIV4 elicited a robust 
in 
post-vaccination 
figure 2, the lower limit of the confidence interval of 
GMT ratios for all homologous strains 21 days after last 
vaccination was 1·3 or more, demonstrating superiority, 
and the highest GMT ratios against all homologous 
strains were observed in participants aged 6 through 23 
months compared with other age groups. In vaccine- 
naive participants, the GMTs for homologous A/H1N1 
and A/H3N2 after a single dose of aIIV4 were similar to 
the GMTs after two doses of the comparator vaccine 
(appendix). Additionally, the GMT ratios after a single 
dose ranged from 2·00 (95% CI 1·8–2·3) for B/Yamagata 
to 2·80 (2·5–3·2) for A/H1N1 (appendix). 
At 180 days after the last vaccination, the GMTs were 
higher in the aIIV4 group than in the comparator vaccine 
group for all homologous strains in all age groups. GMT 
ratios ranged from 1·57 (95% CI 1·4–1·7) for A/H3N2 to 
1·86 (1·7–2·0) for A/H1N1 and B/Yamagata. 
aIIV4 was superior to comparator vaccine in sero- 
conversion for all homologous strains 21 days after last 
vaccination in all participants (appendix). The Center for 
Biologics Evaluation and Research criteria for sero- 
conversion were met by all participants receiving aIIV4 
and comparator across the overall groups as well as age 
and dose subgroups (appendix). 



Consistent with greater relative vaccine efficacy in 
participants aged 6 through 23 months, 40·3% more of 
receiving 
participants 
comparator achieved a haemagglutination inhibition titre 
of 1:629 or more against the homologous A/H3N2 strain; 
whereas the percentage difference was 13·0% for those 
aged 2 through 5 years. The same trends in differences in 
percentages of participants reaching the specified threshold 
titres were observed for the other vaccine strains (figure 3). 
The GMTs for the heterologous strains for the A/H3N2 
and the B strains were higher for aIIV4 than for the 
last 
comparator vaccine group 21 days after 
vaccination (appendix). For the heterologous A/H3N2 
and B strains, the percentages of participants with 
seroconversion and haemagglutination inhibition titre of 
1:40 or more were higher in the aIIV4 group than in the 
comparator vaccine group (appendix). Most importantly, 
the immunogenicity of aIIV4 was significantly greater 
against 
(egg-propagated) A/Hong 
Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2) strain than the comparator. 
Similar to the other efficacy and immunogenicity 
analyses, the highest GMT ratios were observed in

participants aged 6 through 23 months for all influenza 
strains except heterologous A/H1N1 (appendix). The 
heterologous A/H1N1 strain, from the period before the 
2009 pandemic, showed low responses with both aIIV4 
and the comparator vaccine. 
In the overall population, the incidence of any 
solicited adverse event was higher in participants who 
received aIIV4 
the 
comparator vaccine (3748 [73%] of 5138 vs 3242 [64%] of 
5056; appendix). Most solicited adverse events were 



mild to moderate in severity, and most reported fevers 
were less than 39°C. The appendix shows the numbers 
and proportions of participants with solicited and 
unsolicited adverse events. Despite absolute differences 
in the proportions of participants reporting adverse 
events in younger and older children, the relative 
distribution between the vaccine groups was consistent 
across the age groups. A greater proportion of 
participants in the aIIV4 group than in the non- 
adjuvanted vaccine group reported tenderness, fever

(≥38°C), or use of analgesic or anti pyretic agents 
(appendix). 
The proportion of participants who reported any un- 
solicited adverse event was similar for the aIIV4 and the 
comparator vaccine groups (3576 [68%] of 5243 vs 
3543 [69%] of 5161; appendix). A similar pattern was 
also observed for possibly related adverse events, any 
unsolicited serious adverse events, adverse events of 
special interest, unsolicited adverse events leading to 
death, unsolicited adverse events leading to withdrawal 
from the study or vaccine, admissions to hospital, and 
new-onset chronic disease for all age groups. The most 
commonly reported unsolicited adverse events in either 
vaccine group were influenza-like illness and upper 
respiratory tract infection (appendix). Nine adverse 
events of special interest occurred in the study: five in 
participants who received aIIV4 and four in those who 
received 
comparator; however, none were 
considered to be related to the vaccine by the study 
investigators. 

Discussion 
Our study, in which aIIV4 and the comparator were 
administered at a 0·25 mL dose in children aged less 
than 3 years, showed that aIIV4 had significantly greater 
efficacy in preventing influenza versus a comparator 
without an adjuvant 
in children aged 6 through 
23 months, and similar efficacy in older children, with 
age emerging as a significant effect modifier. The 
immune response to vaccination with aIIV4 was superior 
across all ages, with significantly greater GMT ratios 
and seroconversion against both homologous and 
heterologous strains relative to the comparator. The 
difference in immune response was greatest in children 
younger than 2 years compared with older children. After 
vaccination with aIIV4, more children achieved a 
haemagglutination inhibition titre threshold of 1:629 
or more, which was previously associated with 
90% protection against influenza in children,19 and this 
enhancement was most apparent in children aged 
6 through 23 months. These age-related differences in the 
immune response to vaccination provide a biologically 
plausible rationale for the increase in efficacy seen in 
younger children. 
aIIV4 had greater relative vaccine efficacy after a single 
dose but before the second vaccine dose in children 
considered vaccine-naive to previous vaccination, a 
finding supported by higher GMTs seen after the first 
dose of aIIV4 versus comparator. This result has 
implications for children who have not been previously 
vaccinated or exposed to influenza, especially when 
vaccines are administered late in the influenza season or 
the season starts early. In routine paediatric practice, 
many vaccine-naive children receive only a single 
vaccination.21 
Overall, the safety profiles of the aIIV4 and comparator 
vaccine were similar except for a greater incidence of 

solicited adverse events reported by participants who 
received aIIV4, most of which were mild to moderate in 
severity and of short duration. A greater proportion of 
children 
tenderness 
the aIIV4 group reported 
(most cases were assessed as mild to moderate in 
severity) and fever (most <39°C). The increased reports 
of solicited adverse events in aIIV4 are consistent with 
the study of aIIV3 in this age group.20 The proportion of 
participants who reported unsolicited adverse events, 
including serious adverse events, new-onset chronic 
disease, and adverse events of special interest, were 
similar between the two vaccine groups. 
It is important to consider why the results of this 
study are different from an earlier study that showed 
greater vaccine efficacy after vaccination with aIIV3 in 
children aged 6 months through 5 years.20 The ages of 
children enrolled in the two studies were similar; 
however, all children in the earlier trial were considered 
naive with regard to previous influenza vaccination, 
whereas children who had been previously vaccinated 
were included in the current study. Consequently, all 
participants in the earlier trial received two doses of 
aIIV3 or IIV3, but those in the current study received 
either one or two doses of aIIV4 or either IIV3 or IIV4. 
In the current study, nearly half of the children had 
baseline haemagglutination inhibition titres of 1:40 or 
more against either A/H1N1 or A/H3N2, which was 
more than twice the percentage in the previous aIIV3 
study. In the earlier study, the proportion of children 
with baseline haemagglutination inhibition titres of 1:40 
or more in those aged 6 months through 5 years against 
all three vaccine strains was similar to that of children 
aged 6 through 23 months in the current study. The 
differences in study population might explain the 
greater GMT ratios favouring aIIV3 seen in the earlier 
study compared with the GMT ratios favouring aIIV4 in 
the current study. In this trial, age was more closely 
the 
associated with 
historical assessment of vaccine naivety in the overall 
study population and might explain why additional 
clinical benefit was shown in the youngest age group 
but not in naive children of all ages. MF59 increases the 
magnitude of immune response to vaccination with 
influenza, and this effect was most evident in children 
at any age with 
low baseline haemagglutination 
inhibition titres to the strain of virus in the vaccine. The 
different findings in the two studies might therefore be 
explained by differences in previous exposure to 
influenza and are consistent with 
the proposed 
mechanism of action of MF59 in infants, which skews 
the immune system towards a more mature immune 
response.22,23 


Another explanation for the differences in the results 
of the two studies is the epidemiology of influenza 
during the seasons when the trials were done. Most 
influenza cases in the earlier trial were caused by a 
virus strain that was antigenically similar to the strain 



used in the vaccine. The relative efficacy of aIIV3 
compared with IIV3 (Influsplit) was 75% (95% CI 
55–87) in children aged 6 months through 5 years and 
73% (29–90) in those aged 6 through 23 months.20 By 
contrast, the majority of influenza cases in the current 
trial were reported during the 2014–15 season, when 
the predominant circulating virus was a strain of 
A/H3N2 that was antigenically distinct from the 
vaccine strain. In the setting of substantial antigenic 
drift, which occurred during the current study, we 
hypo thesise that MF59 was particularly effective at 
enhancing the vaccine response in the youngest 
children because they were immunologically naive to 
influenza. This apparent cross-protection 
in our 
current trial is supported by evidence of epitope 
spreading shown in earlier studies of an MF59- 
adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine.24 
A limitation to the current study is that most children 
were enrolled in one season, and the overwhelming 
majority of influenza cases included in the final 
analysis was derived from this single season, in which 
the most prominent circulating strain (A/H3N2) was 
antigenically distinct from the vaccine strain. Despite 
this disadvantage, aIIV4 was still more effective than 
the comparator in preventing influenza in the youngest 
age group. Although this subgroup was a prespecified 
objective in the trial, multiplicity adjustment for 
type I error was not accounted for in the statistical 
design. However, tests for interaction (Breslow-Day 
test and a proportional hazards regression that used 
age as an interaction term) returned significant p 
values; therefore, age was a modifier of the vaccine 
effect, and analyses by age subgroups are a necessary 
consideration. 
In conclusion, this study showed that aIIV4 provided 
significantly superior efficacy and immunogenicity than 
a non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in a prespecified 
age group of children aged 6 through 23 months, and 
superior immunogenicity and similar safety profile in 
all children aged 6 months through 5 years. The broader 
and more persistent immune response to aIIV4 versus 
comparator in the youngest children and those without 
previous influenza vaccination are consistent with past 
studies of MF59-adjuvanted seasonal and pandemic 
influenza vaccines in young children.12,20 Furthermore, 
the differences between the current study and the earlier 
into the 
study of aIIV3 offer 
mechanism of action of MF59 in the context of the 
developing immune system. Despite the poor effect- 
iveness of licensed vaccines in 2014–15 attributed to 
substantial antigenic drift, aIIV4 had greater efficacy 
in the youngest, most vulnerable population during 
this period.
