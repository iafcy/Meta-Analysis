Introduction: Annual seasonal influenza epidemics are particularly danger- 
ous for the very young, the elderly and chronically ill individuals, in whom 
infection can cause severe morbidity, hospitalization and death. Existing, 
nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines exhibit a suboptimal immunogenicity and 
efficacy in immunologically naive subjects such as young children. 
Methods: This phase II, randomized clinical trial was conducted to evaluate 
the antibody and cell-mediated responses to a trivalent influenza vaccine 
administered without adjuvant (TIV) or adjuvanted with MF59 (ATIV) in 
previously nonvaccinated children less than 3 years of age. 
Results: The MF59-adjuvanted vaccine was well tolerated, and induced 
higher titers of hemagglutination inhibition antibodies able to recognize 
strains different from the one used in the vaccine (heterovariant) than TIV. 
The presence of the adjuvant MF59 induced a larger expansion of vaccine- 
specific CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, the adjuvant MF59 did not modify the 
cytokine profile of the elicited T cells, characterized by the production of 
IL-2 and TNF-α, and did not bias the response toward either Th1 or Th2. 
The advantage of ATIV over TIV was more pronounced for the virus strains 
that had not circulated in the years that preceded this study and for the 
heterovariant strains. 
Conclusion: These data highlight the relevant role played by the oil-in- 
water adjuvant MF59 in enhancing the immunogenicity of inactivated influ- 
enza vaccines in immunologically naive individuals. 



in an average year, 20% of children are infected with influenza 
viruses. This attack rate is substantially higher during epidemic 
years and among restricted populations, such as children in day 
care. Furthermore, children shed large quantities of virus for 
longer periods of time, thus contributing to the spread of influenza 
within the community and household.1 Some countries (including 
the United States) and the World Health Organization recommend 
vaccination of children;2 however, inactivated influenza vaccines,

administered without adjuvant, are less immunogenic in unprimed 
individuals, especially those who are of very young age,3 and this 
inadequate immunogenicity translates into a suboptimal efficacy.4 
The limited efficacy of trivalent inactivated vaccines (TIV) 
can potentially be overcome by vaccines formulated with an adju- 
vant (ATIV). Potent adjuvants for influenza are the oil-in-water 
emulsions like MF59.5 MF59-adjuvanted influenza seasonal vac- 
cines have been licensed in various countries since 1997 for immu- 
nization of elderly subjects (65 years and older) and have shown an 
optimal safety profile in different age groups5–7 and a higher effec- 
tiveness against influenza hospitalization as compared with nonad- 
juvanted TIV.8,9 The higher immunogenicity of MF59-adjuvanted 
vaccines is particularly evident in naive individuals. Vaccination of 
children with ATIV induces higher and more sustained antibody 
responses, as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and by 
microneutralization,4,10 and reduces the attack rates of polymerase 
chain reaction-confirmed influenza-like illness.4 We have previ- 
ously shown that in naive adults the early expansion of vaccine-spe- 
cific CD4+ T lymphocytes associates in a predictive manner with 
the induction of high and sustained neutralizing antibody titers to 
avian and seasonal influenza viruses.11,12 A question not addressed 
yet is how the addition of MF59 to TIV influences either the mag- 
nitude or the cytokine profile of the elicited CD4+ T-cell response 
in children. The present phase II study was conducted to address 
this question and to compare the magnitude as well as the cytokine 
profile of vaccine-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes in children, who 
were administered the nonadjuvanted (TIV) versus the MF59-adju- 
vanted subunit trivalent influenza vaccine (ATIV). 


This study was a phase II, randomized, multicenter clini- 
cal trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01342796) designed to evaluate 
both the antibody and the cell-mediated responses elicited by adju- 
vanted and nonadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines in children. 
The protocol and the informed consent form were reviewed and 
approved by Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Com- 
mittee/Research Ethics Boards before study start. The study was 
conducted at 2 centers in Belgium: Sint Vincentius Ziekenhuis, 
Antwerp and Kinderartsenassociatie, Hasselt. Recruitment began 
in May and July 2011 and was reinitiated between October and 
December 2011 to achieve the target sample size. 

Eligible participants were previously nonvaccinated healthy 
children aged 6 to <36 months of either gender whose parent(s) or 
legal guardian(s) had given written informed consent. 
Exclusion criteria included any known or suspected impair- 
ment of the immune system, any serious medical condition or recent 
infectious disease, immunization with licensed vaccines within 2 
weeks (for inactivated vaccines) or 4 weeks (for live vaccines) or 




any other investigational agent within 30 days prior to enrollment, 
or any history of hypersensitivity to any component of the study 
vaccine. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects during 
the 2 phases of enrollment were similar across treatment groups: 
the mean age (21.4 months in the TIV group and 20.2 months in 
the ATIV group) and the distribution of subjects below or above 
24 months of age were comparable, most of them were Caucasian 
(TIV 76% vs. ATIV 79%), and the mean weight, height and body 
mass index were similar. There were, however, 66% males enrolled 
in the TIV group and 53% in the ATIV group. 
A total of 84 children (6 to <36 months of age) were enrolled. 
Each participant was randomized to receive 2 intramuscular doses 
(0.25 mL each) spaced 4 weeks apart (days 1 and 29) of a trivalent 
seasonal influenza vaccine either nonadjuvanted (TIV; n = 41) or 
adjuvanted (oil-in-water MF59 emulsion, ATIV; n = 43). 
Overall, there were 11 subjects (27%) vaccinated with TIV 
and 18 subjects (42%) vaccinated with ATIV for which a major 
protocol deviation was reported; these were excluded from the 
immunogenicity analysis in a Per Protocol Set (PPS) (TIV; n = 30 
for serology, 31 for cell mediated immunity and ATIV; n = 25) but 
retained in the Safety Set for as long as they participated in the 
study. 
The antigen content of TIV and ATIV (both produced at 
Novartis Vaccines, Siena, Italy) was identical, each vaccine dose 
containing ~7.5 μg of hemagglutinin surface antigen from each 
of the 3 strains, A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008. Five milliliters of blood were 
taken before vaccination (day 1) and 3 weeks after administration 
of the second dose (day 50) for immunogenicity analysis. 

All enrolled subjects were analyzed for safety and reacto- 
genicity throughout the study. This corresponded to 100% subjects 
in each group for the first vaccination and 93% to 95% across vac- 
cine groups after the second vaccination (Safety Set). Three sub- 
jects from the ATIV group and 2 subjects from the TIV group did 
not receive the second vaccination at day 29 and were therefore 
excluded from the safety analysis for the second vaccination. 
Solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) were 
recorded for 7 days after each vaccination. Unsolicited AEs were 
recorded throughout the entire study period (days 1–50). 

HI antibodies were measured as previously described. Anti- 
body titers were measured to the influenza strains homologous 
(A/H1N1/California/07/2009, A/H3N2/Victoria/210/2009 and B/ 
Brisbane/60/2008) and heterologous (A/H3N2/Uruguay/716/2007 
and B/Malaysia/2506/2004) to those present in the study vaccines. 
Results were evaluated as seroconversion (defined as a change in 
HI titer of <1:10 on day 1 to an HI titer ≥1:40 on day 50) or a sig- 
nificant increase in HI titers (defined as a 4-fold or greater increase 
in titer in a subject with a day 1 titer ≥1:10); geometric mean ratio 
of HI geometric mean titer on postvaccination/prevaccination; and 
seroprotection (defined as the proportion of subjects achieving an 
HI titer ≥1:40 postvaccination). When the results were evaluated 
using the criteria of the Committee for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (CHMP), the adult criteria were used since no CHMP 
criteria exist for children: (1) the proportion of subjects achieving 
seroconversion or a significant increase in HI titer should be >40%; 
(2) the geometric mean ratio should be >2.5; (3) the proportion 
of subjects achieving an HI titer ≥1:40 postvaccination should be 
>70%. In addition, seroprotection rates were also analyzed using 
higher antibody thresholds,13 based on the data previously reported.4 
Analysis was performed on both the Full Analysis Set 
(FAS) and the PPS. No difference was found between the 2 
data sets. 
Measurement of T-cell Responses by Intracellular 
Cytokine Staining 
CD4+ T-cell responses were measured by intracellular stain- 
ing and flow cytometry at baseline and at day 50.11 Purified periph- 
eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated overnight, 
in vitro, with the subunit antigens (1 μg/mL) from the follow- 
ing homologous (A/H1N1/California/07/2009, A/H3N2/Victo- 
ria/210/2009 and B/Brisbane/60/2008) and heterologous strains 
(B/Florida/4/2006) in the presence of anti-human aCD28/CD49d 
antibodies (1 μg/mL; BD Bioscience, Sparks, MD) and brefeldin 
A (5 μg/mL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). After overnight stimulation, 
PBMCs were stained with Live Dead (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 
then fixed, permeabilized and stained with anti-human antibod- 
ies to CD3 (clone SK7; BD Bioscience), CD4 (clone RPA-T4; 
BD Bioscience); IL-2 (clone 5344.111; BD Bioscience), IFN-γ 
(clone 4S.B3; BD Bioscience) and TNF-α (clone MAb11; BD 
Bioscience). Samples were acquired on a fluorescence-activated 
cell sorter BD LSR II analyzer. Results were analyzed blind using 
FlowJo software (Tree Star Software, Ashland, OR). The frequency 
and cytokine profile of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells was calculated 
by summing the frequency of CD4+ T cells producing all nonover- 
lapping permutations of the cytokines tested (Boolean and logical 
gates with FlowJo). Data are expressed as number of antigen-spe- 
cific CD4+ T cells per million of total CD4+ T cells. Analysis was 
performed on both the FAS and the PPS. No difference was found 
between the 2 data sets. 

Distributions of HI titers are typically skewed to the right. 
However, log-transformed immunogenicity values are usually 
approximately normally distributed and so this transformation 
(base 10) was applied to all titers. 


Values below the limit of detection were set to half that. 
Means and differences (ie, within vaccine group between visits 
and between vaccine groups across visits, respectively) and per- 
taining 95% confidence intervals were calculated using an analysis 
of covariance with vaccine group as a qualitative factor and while 
adjusting for age cohort and changes in baseline values. 
Statistical inferences between vaccination groups were 
determined using the JMP software. Pairwise differences were 
evaluated by the Tukey–Kramer test on log normalized values, as 
described above. The level of significance for the statistical analysis 
will be set at 5% (P ≤ 0.05). 




Consistent with previous studies,6,7,14 most of the reported 
local and systemic AEs were mild to moderate in intensity and 
resolved within a few days of vaccination. The proportion of sub- 
jects reporting solicited AEs was higher in the group that received 
ATIV (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww. 
com/INF/B945) while the incidence of unsolicited AEs was com- 
parable in the 2 vaccine groups (see Table, Supplemental Digital 
Content 2, http://links.lww.com/INF/B946). The most commonly 
reported local AE after the first vaccine dose was tenderness at the 




site of injection. There were no reports of severe local reactions in 
response to TIV or ATIV. 

Both TIV and ATIV induced a significant increase of HI 
antibodies against the vaccine strains (A/H1N1California, A/ 
H3N2Victoria and B/Brisbane). ATIV induced a significant 
increase of HI antibodies also against strains heterologous to the 
ones contained in the vaccine (A/Uruguay and B/Malaysia). HI 
antibody titers induced by ATIV were significantly higher than 
those induced by TIV for A/H3N2Victoria, B/Brisbane and for 
the heterologous B/Malaysia. HI titers for A/H1N1California 
were higher after ATIV as compared with TIV, but the differ- 
ence between the 2 vaccines was not statistically significant (see 
Fig. 1 and Table, Supplemental Digital Content 3–4, http://links. 
lww.com/INF/B947 and http://links.lww.com/INF/B948). It is 
important to note that prevaccination HI titers were higher for 
A/H1N1California compared with A/H3N2Victoria and B/Bris- 
bane (P < 0.0001 by the Tukey–Kramer HSD test). These results 
support a previous exposure of vaccinees to A/H1N1California, 
which extensively circulated since the 2009 pandemic, but not to 
the other strains analyzed in this study. 
The serologic results were then evaluated using the criteria 
of the CHMP. Since there are no CHMP licensure criteria for influ- 
enza vaccines in pediatric age, we applied the ones used in adults 
(see Materials and Methods). 
All 3 CHMP criteria were met for the influenza A strains 
by both TIV and ATIV. For the B strain all 3 criteria were met for 
ATIV while in the TIV group seroprotection was not met, with only 
57% of children achieving an HI titer ≥1:40 (see Table 1 and Table, 
Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/INF/B947). 
Recently it has been proposed that the adult correlate of seropro- 
tection (HI titer ≥1:40) may not be appropriate in children since 
HI titers of 1:40, 1:110 and 1:330 predict 22%, 50% and 80% of 
clinical protection, respectively, in this age group.13 Applying more 
stringent criteria of seroprotection, the difference between ATIV 
and TIV becomes more obvious with 80% of children in the ATIV 
group versus 53% in the TIV group reaching an HI ≥1:330 for A/ 
H1N1California. Similarly, 92% of children in the ATIV group ver- 
sus 23% in the TIV group reached an HI ≥1:330 for A/H3N2Victo- 
ria and 40% in ATIV versus 10% in TIV for B/Brisbane (see Fig. 2 
and Table, Supplemental Digital Content 4, http://links.lww.com/ 
INF/B948). 

We then analyzed the impact of vaccination on the fre- 
quency and cytokine profile of vaccine-specific CD4+ T cells. ATIV 
induced the expansion of CD4+ T cells specific for both homologous 
(A/H1N1California, A/H3N2Victoria and B/Brisbane) and heter- 
ologous (B/Florida) influenza antigens. Conversely, TIV induced a 
significant expansion of CD4+ T cells only for A/H1N1California 
and A/H3N2Victoria. The expansion of CD4+ T cells specific for 
A/H1N1California was not significantly different after vaccination 
with TIV versus ATIV, whereas the expansion of CD4+ T cells spe- 
cific for A/H3N2Victoria or B/Brisbane was significantly higher 
after ATIV as compared with TIV (P ≤ 0.0001) (Fig. 3). 
The cytokine profile of influenza-specific CD4+ T cells was 
comparable after vaccination with TIV and ATIV and was domi- 
nated by the production of IL-2 and TNF-α (Fig. 4). Only a small 
percentage of influenza-specific CD4+ T cells produced IFN-γ and/ 
or IL-13, and their frequency did not increase after vaccination 
and was comparable after vaccination with TIV and ATIV (Fig. 4). 
These data in children confirm our previous findings in adults and 
the elderly vaccinated with MF59-adjuvanted avian H5N1 or sea- 
sonal vaccines on the ability of influenza vaccination to expand 
vaccine-specific CD4+ T cells, especially against those strains to 
which the populations have not been exposed and against hetero- 
variant strains.11,15 They also confirm the ability of MF59 to induce 
an increased expansion of vaccine-specific CD4+ T cells without 
modifying their cytokine profile.

Conventional, nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines have a long 
track record of use and success. Despite this, they fail to induce high 
and persistent immune responses in immunologically naive individu- 
als. Formulation with adjuvants, especially oil-in-water emulsions 
like MF59, enhances the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in 
naive individuals like children vaccinated against seasonal influ- 
enza10,16 or adults vaccinated against avian H5N1, an antigen the pop- 
ulation has not been exposed to.11,12,17 In children, MF59-adjuvanted 
seasonal influenza vaccines induce stronger and more sustained HI 
and neutralizing antibody responses than the conventional nonadju- 
vanted vaccines and reduce the risk of infections.4 
Despite the central role of HA-specific antibodies in protec- 
tion from influenza infection, several reports point at a critical func- 
tion for T lymphocytes in the direct killing of infected targets and 
also in orchestrating the optimal activation of B lymphocytes.11,12 
We have previously shown that in adults the administration of an 
MF59-adjuvanted A/H5N1 vaccine induces a rapid expansion of 
vaccine-specific CD4+ T cells that predicts induction of high anti- 
body responses and immune memory, thus supporting a central role 
for helper CD4+ T cells in the optimal response to vaccination.11,12 
In this study we show that, in previously unvaccinated chil- 
dren aged 6 to <36 months, the MF59-adjuvanted ATIV induces a 
strong immune response, as assessed by the increase in HI antibody

titers and the expansion of vaccine-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes. 
The cytokine profile of influenza-specific CD4+ T cells was compa- 
rable after TIV and ATIV vaccination, and dominated by IL-2 and 
TNF-α-producing CD4+ T cells. The proportion of CD4+ T cells 
producing IFN-γ, a classic Th1 cytokine, or IL-13, a classic Th2- 
type cytokine, was limited and did not increase following vacci- 
nation with either TIV or ATIV. In children, influenza vaccination 
does expand antigen-specific CD4+ T cells with a Th0-like cytokine 
profile and the adjuvant MF59 does not bias the immune response 
toward either Th1 or Th2. This confirms in children the results 
obtained in other age groups on the ability of MF59 to increase 
the magnitude of both the antibody and the CD4+ T-cell response, 
without modifying the cytokine profile of vaccine-specific CD4+ T 
cells.4,7,10,11 However, the observed absence of a Th2 bias is in con- 
tradiction with data reporting a strong production of Th2 cytokines 
in children, of the same age group, vaccinated with a split influ- 
enza vaccine.18 Differences in the vaccine composition, the use 
of seasonal versus avian strains, the age of the children, previous 
exposure to the antigen as well as the experimental approaches 
used to detect cytokines can influence the quality of the immune 
responses.18,19 
It is noteworthy that MF59-adjuvanted influenza (ATIV) 
induced stronger responses than the nonadjuvanted (TIV) vac- 
cines against viruses both homologous (A/H3N2/Victoria and

B/Brisbane) and heterologous (A/H3N2/Uruguay, B/Florida 
and B/Malaysia) to the vaccine strains. The immune response to 
A/H1N1/California was not statistically different between TIV 
and ATIV. We believe that this difference can be explained by 
previous exposure of the children to A/H1N1/California but not 
to A/H3N2 or to B strains. The clinical study was, in fact, per- 
formed between April and December 2011. The pandemic strain 
A/H1N1/California spread to Europe in the summer of 2009 and 
circulated widely until the spring of 2010. During this time, the 
circulation of A/H3N2 strains was minimal; these virus strains 
did not reemerge until the beginning of 2012 when this study had 
already been concluded.20 These epidemiologic data, together 
with the higher prevaccination HI titers against A/H1N1/Cali- 
fornia, suggest that most of the children enrolled in this trial had 
been exposed to A/H1N1/California and to a lower extent to the 
other 2 vaccine strains. 
A limitation of this study is represented by the small sample 
size which was not powered to detect rare events following immu- 
nization. Despite this, the data obtained provide mechanistic insight 
into the adaptive immune response of adjuvant added to influenza 
vaccines used to vaccinate children and correlate with the safety 
profile of MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in children already 
reported in larger studies.4,6,7 
Taken together, the data presented here strongly support 
the advantage of using the MF59-adjuvanted ATIV over the non- 
adjuvanted TIV in priming an immune response in immunologi- 
cally naive subjects, like young children, and to widen the breadth 
of the response to heterologous virus strains. We conclude that 
MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccines are safe and immunogenic in 
children and support its use in this age group to confer higher and 
broader protection in unprimed children.
