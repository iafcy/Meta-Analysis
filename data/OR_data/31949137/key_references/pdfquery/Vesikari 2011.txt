Background 
The efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines is known to be poor in infants and 
young children. 
Methods 
We studied the effect of the adjuvant MF59, an oil-in-water emulsion, on the efficacy 
of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in 4707 healthy children 6 to less than 
72 months of age who had not previously been vaccinated against influenza. The 
children were randomly assigned to three study groups, each of which received the 
assigned vaccines in two doses, 28 days apart, during two consecutive influenza 
seasons. Two of the groups were given age-appropriate doses of TIV either with or 
without the MF59 adjuvant, and the third group was given control (noninfluenza) 
vaccines to assess their absolute and relative efficacy against influenza-like illness, 
as confirmed by means of polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. 
Results 
Attack rates of influenza-like illness across both influenza seasons were 0.7%, 2.8%, 
and 4.7% in the adjuvant, nonadjuvant, and control vaccine groups, respectively. The 
absolute vaccine efficacy rates against all influenza strains (94 of 110 cases were 
due to vaccine-matched H3N2 viruses) were 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74 to 
93) for the MF59-adjuvant vaccine (ATIV) and 43% (95% CI, 15 to 61) for the vaccine 
without the adjuvant (TIV); the relative vaccine efficacy rate for ATIV versus TIV was 
75% (95% CI, 55 to 87). The efficacy rates for ATIV were 79% (95% CI, 55 to 90) in 
children 6 to less than 36 months of age and 92% (95% CI, 77 to 97) in those 36 to 
less than 72 months of age, as compared with 40% (95% CI, −6 to 66) and 45% 
(95% CI, 6 to 68), respectively, for TIV. Antibody responses were higher with ATIV 
and remained so through day 181. The rates of systemic and local reactions to the 
influenza vaccines with and without the adjuvant were similar in the younger age 
group (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.09), but systemic events in the older age 
group were more frequent after administration of ATIV (63%) than after adminis- 
tration of TIV (44%) or the control vaccine (50%). Serious adverse events were dis- 
tributed evenly across the three vaccine groups. 
Conclusions 
Influenza vaccine with the MF59 adjuvant is efficacious against PCR-confirmed 
influenza in infants and young children. (Funded by Novartis Vaccines and Diag- 
nostics; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00644059.) 








seasonal influenza infection and illness, 
with amplification of community viral 
transmission. Thus, numerous countries recom- 
mend routine seasonal vaccination to protect chil- 
dren directly and the entire population indirectly.1-9 
Parenteral trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine 
(TIV) is poorly immunogenic in young children, 
with an efficacy of only 59.0% in children older 
than 2 years of age.10-12 Although intranasal live 
attenuated influenza vaccine has an efficacy of 
69.2 to 95.6% in children 2 to 7 years of age, it 
cannot be used in children under 2 years of age 
because of the increased risk of hospitalization 
or in children under 5 years of age who have a 
history of wheezing, because of the increased risk 
of wheezing.13,14 
MF59 is an oil-in-water emulsion that augments 
the immune response when combined with vac- 
cine antigens. It has been used since 1997 as a 
TIV adjuvant (ATIV) for seasonal vaccination in 
older adults and is licensed for such use in 27 
countries.15-17 We previously found that ATIV in- 
duced greater immune responses than did TIV in 
children 6 to 36 months of age,18,19 and we re- 
port here the efficacy of these two types of vac- 
cines in a field trial in children 6 to less than 72 
months of age who had not previously received 
influenza vaccine. 

Study Design and Objectives 
We conducted this phase 3 study during two in- 
fluenza seasons: 2007–2008 in Germany (654 chil- 
dren) and 2008–2009 in Germany (2104 children) 
and Finland (1949 children). Participants were 
stratified according to age (6 to <36 months and 
36 to <72 months) and were randomly assigned 
to one of three study groups. In year 1, they were 
assigned to ATIV, subunit TIV, or control (non- 
influenza) vaccine in a ratio of 2:1:1; in study year 2, 
they were assigned to ATIV, split TIV, or control vac- 
cine in a ratio of 2:2:1. The subunit influenza vac- 
cine consisted of purified hemagglutinin and neur- 
aminidase viral-surface proteins; the split vaccine 
consisted of purified disrupted virions. Vaccines 
were administered in two doses, 28 days apart, with 
or without concomitant routine vaccines. 
The study was approved by the ethics com- 
mittee at each participating study center and 
was conducted according to the International 
Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines. Although planned to last 
3 years, the study was terminated in 2009 after 
requests by the ethics committees to substitute 
seasonal vaccine with monovalent influenza A 
(H1N1) vaccine; any children who were recruited 
and vaccinated with pandemic (A/H1N1) or non- 
pandemic vaccines in year 3 were not included in 
this analysis. 
The principal study objectives were to show 
that in children 6 to less than 36 months of age, 
ATIV has an acceptable level of combined local 
and systemic reactogenicity, as compared with TIV, 
and superior protective efficacy, as compared with 
control vaccine, against vaccine-matched influenza 
illness confirmed by means of real-time poly- 
merase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. The study par- 
ticipants were healthy children who had not pre- 
viously received influenza vaccine, who had no 
contraindications to vaccination, and whose par- 
ents gave written informed consent. Solicited re- 
actions were recorded on diary cards for 7 days, 
with active follow-up for 28 days after each vac- 
cination for unsolicited adverse events and for 
6 months in study year 1 and for 12 months in 
study year 2 to collect data on adverse events that 
were serious or led to withdrawal from the study. 
During the two consecutive influenza seasons, 
beginning 3 weeks after administration of the 
second vaccine dose, if a child became ill, the par- 
ents were asked to bring the child to the clinic for 
examination within 7 days after the onset of the 
illness, at which time nasopharyngeal aspirates 
or swabs were obtained for confirmation of the 
influenza diagnosis and for strain identification 
by means of real-time PCR and gene-sequencing 
techniques developed and conducted at the Uni- 
versitätsklinikum Jena.1,20 Events occurring with- 
in the preceding 7 days were recorded as unso- 
licited adverse events. 
In study year 2, in a convenience sample of 793 
children who were recruited at 14 sites in Finland, 
we obtained at least one prevaccination blood 
sample (on day 1) and three postvaccination sam- 
ples (on days 29, 51, and 181). Hemagglutination- 
inhibition antibody titers were measured against 
three homologous 2008–2009 vaccine strains and 
against three heterologous vaccine strains — 
A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/ 
15/2009 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 — from 
influenza seasons 2007–2008, 2010–2011, and 
2009–2010, respectively (see the Methods section 
in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org).21 Seropro- 






tection was defined as a hemagglutination-inhi- 
bition antibody titer of 40 or greater. 
The study was designed and conducted by the 
sponsor, Novartis Vaccines, in collaboration with 
the study investigators, who gathered the clinical 
data. Novartis Vaccines conducted the data analy- 
sis, and the manuscript was written by the first 
author, with the assistance of one of the industry 
authors and a medical writer with support from 
the sponsor. The decision to submit the manu- 
script for publication was made by the first author. 
All authors vouch for the accuracy and complete- 
ness of the analyses presented and the adherence 
of the study and this report to the protocol. The 
complete protocol is available at NEJM.org. 
Active Vaccines and Control Vaccines 
In the 2007–2008 season, ATIV (Fluad, Novartis 
Vaccines), which included MF59 emulsion adju- 
vant, and subunit TIV (Agrippal S1, Novartis Vac- 
cines) contained World Health Organization ref- 
erence strains A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), 
A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/ 
2506/2004). In the 2008–2009 season, ATIV and 
split TIV (Influsplit SSW, GlaxoSmithKline Bio- 
logicals) contained A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), 
A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2), and B/Florida/4/2006 
strains. Vaccines contained 15 μg of hemagglu- 
tinin from each of three viral subtypes in each 
0.5-ml dose. Children 6 to less than 36 months 
of age received 0.25-ml doses, and children 36 to 
less than 72 months of age received 0.5-ml doses. 
Control vaccines were meningococcal C conju- 
gate vaccine (Menjugate, Novartis Vaccines), giv- 
en in 0.25-ml doses in children 6 to less than 12 
months of age, and tickborne encephalitis vac- 
cine (Encepur Children, Novartis Vaccines), given 
in 0.5-ml doses in children 12 to less than 72 
months of age. 
Statistical Analysis 
We planned to enroll approximately 8000 children 
over three seasons in order to have 90% power for 
the safety objective and up to 80% power for the 
efficacy objective. Demographic characteristics 
were tabulated with the use of descriptive statis- 
tics. The relative risk of real-time PCR–confirmed 
influenza-like illness was estimated with the use 
of a Poisson regression model that included sea- 
son, region, and age cohort (when applicable) as 
independent variables, with log10-transformed val- 
ues for time at risk as an offset variable (ignoring 
family and household relationships of the study 
participants). The ratio of likelihood-based esti- 
mates and two-sided 97.7% confidence intervals 
were adjusted for the primary efficacy and safety 
analyses and one interim analysis; for other analy- 
ses, 95% confidence intervals were calculated. The 
Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel approach was used for 
the safety analysis and selected vaccine efficacy re- 
sults, for robustness. Vaccine efficacy was calcu- 
lated as (1 – the relative risk) × 100%. The two pri- 
mary analyses were adjusted for multiplicity, so 
that in 240 comparative analyses (e.g., of vaccine 
efficacy in four age cohorts, as well as solid-phase 
and geometric mean titers in two age cohorts 
each), 12 significant findings could be expected 
by chance. To evaluate immunogenicity end points, 
least-squares geometric mean titers and ratios and 
associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals 
were determined by means of analysis of variance 
(with log10 transformation). 

Study Population and Follow-up 
Baseline characteristics of the 4707 enrolled chil- 
dren were similar among the three vaccine groups 
(Fig. 1). Safety data were available for 4692 chil- 
dren, 4513 of whom completed the study; 13 chil- 
dren withdrew because of adverse events. 
Assessments of Efficacy 
Of 47 cases of influenza-like illness in the con- 
trol group (Table 1), 4 occurred among 164 chil- 
dren in study year 1 (attack rate, 2.4%) and 43 
among 829 children in study year 2 (attack rate, 
5.2%). Vaccine efficacy was not calculated for 
year 1, since there were only 5 cases, 3 of which 
were due to B/Florida/4/2006–like viruses (Yama- 
gata lineage, lineage-mismatched to the vaccine 
strain) and 2 of which were due to viruses with 
unknown B lineage. 
In study year 2, a total of 94 of the 105 isolates 
from children with influenza-like illness were A/ 
Brisbane/10/2007(H3N2)–like viruses (matched to 
the vaccine strain), 4 were A-type viruses (subtype 
unknown), 5 were B/Brisbane/60/2008–like viruses 
(Victoria lineage, lineage mismatched to the vac- 
cine strain), and 2 were B-type viruses (lineage 
unknown). No H1N1 viruses were detected. In 
study year 2, the vaccine efficacy was 86% (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 73 to 92) for ATIV, as 
compared with 40% (95% CI, 11 to 60) for split 
TIV, for a relative vaccine efficacy of 76% (95% CI, 
55 to 87). 






The absolute efficacy of ATIV across both influ- 
enza seasons was 86% (95% CI, 74 to 93) against 
all strains, 89% (95% CI, 78 to 95) against vac- 
cine-matched strains and H3N2 virus, and 79% 
(95% CI, −5 to 96) against B strains (Table 1). In 
the subanalysis, ATIV was efficacious in both age 
groups. In children who were 6 to less than 36 
months of age, vaccine efficacy was 79% against 
all strains and 81% against vaccine-matched strains 
(with lower 95% CI limits of 55% and 49%, respec- 
tively), and in children 36 to less than 72 months 
of age, vaccine efficacy was 92% against all strains 
and 96% against vaccine-matched strains (with 
lower 95% CI limits of 77% and 81%, respectively), 
fulfilling the primary study objective. 
In contrast, TIV had an efficacy of 43% (95% 
CI, 15 to 61) against all strains, 45% (95% CI, 16 
to 64) against vaccine-matched strains and the 
H3N2 virus, and 36% (95% CI, −162 to 84) against 
B strains, with similar point estimates in the age 
subgroups but with the 95% CI overlapping zero 
for children who were 6 to less than 36 months of 
age. On the basis of these results, ATIV had high- 
er relative efficacy than TIV, with relative efficacy 
rates of 75% (95% CI, 55 to 87) against all strains, 
80% (95% CI, 59 to 90) against vaccine-matched 
strains and the H3N2 virus, and 66% (95% CI, 
−103 to 94) against B strains, in the entire cohort. 
The relative efficacy rates for ATIV according to 
age group were 64% against all strains and 68% 
against matched strains among children who were 
6 to less than 36 months of age and 86% and 91%, 
respectively, among those who were 36 to less than 
72 months of age. In a post hoc analysis of vac- 
cine efficacy in children 6 to less than 24 months 
of age, the overall efficacy of ATIV against matched

gous and heterologous antigens after two doses 
of TIV were exceeded or matched after one dose 
of ATIV (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Safety and Reactogenicity 
Among the children who were 6 to less than 36 
months of age, the relative risk of solicited adverse 
events after one or two doses of ATIV, as com- 
pared with TIV, was 1.04 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.09), 
fulfilling the primary safety objective. Local ad- 
verse events were reported more frequently among 
ATIV recipients (54%) and recipients of control vac- 
cine (52%) than among TIV recipients (46%), but 
rates of systemic adverse events were similar (68%, 
61%, and 66%, respectively). Among the children 
who were 36 to less than 72 months of age, local 
adverse events were reported in 68%, 60%, and 
55% of recipients of ATIV, TIV, and control vac- 
cine, respectively, whereas systemic adverse events 
were more frequent among ATIV recipients (63%) 
and control-vaccine recipients (50%) than among 
TIV recipients (44%). The majority of local and 
systemic solicited events, including fever, were mild 
or moderate and were transient (Tables 1 and 2 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Febrile convul- 
sions were reported in five ATIV recipients, five TIV 
recipients, and four recipients of control vaccine. 
Rates of all unsolicited or serious adverse events 
strains was 75% (95% CI, 20 to 92), whereas TIV 
had almost no efficacy (2%) (95% CI, −129 to 58). 
The time–cumulative efficacy calculations showed 
that the estimates of vaccine efficacy for ATIV and 
TIV were robust throughout the 5-month surveil- 
lance period (Fig. 2). 
Immunogenicity 
After one dose of vaccine, the proportions of chil- 
dren 6 to less than 36 months of age who had se- 
roprotective hemagglutination-inhibition antibody 
titers (≥40) against the homologous influenza A 
H1N1 and H3N2 strains were 92% and 95%, re- 
spectively, among the ATIV recipients and 20% 
and 12%, respectively, among the TIV recipients. 
Among children who were 36 to less than 72 
months of age, the respective proportions were 
100% and 97% for ATIV and 63% and 60% for 
TIV (Fig. 3). Moreover, 98 to 100% of all ATIV re- 
cipients still had seroprotective titers against these 
strains at day 181, whereas the respective propor- 
tions for TIV recipients were 49% and 65%. 
Two doses of ATIV (day 50) elicited seroprotec- 
tive antibody titers (≥40) against the homologous 
influenza B strain in 88% of the younger children 
and in 99% of the older children, with the pro- 
portions declining to 40% and 64%, respectively, 
by day 181. The proportions of TIV recipients who 
had robust hemagglutination-inhibition antibody 
titers against the B strain were lower even after 
two doses; only 19% of the younger children and 
60% of the older children had seroprotective re- 
sponses, and the proportions were only 13% and 
33%, respectively, at day 181. The median interval 
between doses for the three vaccine groups was 
30 days (standard deviation, 6.1 to 6.9). 
Two doses of ATIV produced seroprotective ti- 
ters (≥40) against heterologous H1N1 and H3N2 
antigens in 95 to 100% of recipients in the two age 
groups, and these levels were maintained at day 
181 in 61% or more of the younger children and in 
85% or more of the older children. The B-lineage 
mismatch was not effectively overcome by ATIV; 
only 5 to 15% of recipients had a seroprotective 
titer against the Victoria lineage strain. In those 
given TIV, the responses to heterologous strains 
were low, with the exception of the heterovariant 
H3N2 virus. The geometric mean titers against 
A subtype strains in response to heterologous 
antigens with ATIV exceeded those in response 
to homologous antigens with TIV; in both age 
groups, these titers in response to all homolo-

over the course of the whole study were similar in 
the ATIV, TIV, and control-vaccine groups; no 
deaths and no cases of narcolepsy were reported. 
Serious adverse events were reported in 8% of 
ATIV recipients, 10% of TIV recipients, and 11% 
of control-vaccine recipients, among children who 
were 6 to less than 36 months of age, and in 4%, 
8%, and 11%, respectively, of those who were 36 to 
less than 72 months of age (Table 2). A total of 13 
children were withdrawn from the study because 
of serious adverse events. In addition, 2 children

* Events are listed according to the terminology from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, which is organized by system, organ, 
and class. Thirteen events led to withdrawal from the study: one case each of strabismus, growth retardation, brain tumor, and diarrhea in 
the group of younger children who received the trivalent influenza vaccine with the MF59 adjuvant (ATIV); one case each of food allergy, 
acquiredepileptic aphasia, pyrexia, and otitis media in the group of older ATIV recipients; one case each of ataxia on walking, rash, asthma, 
 
and lymphadenopathy in the group of younger children who received the trivalent influenza vaccine without the MF59 adjuvant (TIV); and 
one case of asthma in the group of older children who received control vaccine. 
ous adverse events that were judged to be possibly 
or probably related to the vaccination (for details, 
see the Supplementary Appendix). 

ATIV was efficacious against laboratory-confirmed 
influenza caused by all circulating influenza viral 
strains during the two study years (86% efficacy 
rate), with higher efficacy against vaccine-matched 
strains (89%). In contrast, the respective efficacy 
rates for TIV were 43% and 45%, resulting in rela- 
tive efficacy rates of 75% and 80% for ATIV as 
compared with TIV. The higher efficacy rates were 
significant in the predefined age cohorts (i.e., 6 to 
less than 36 months and 36 to less than 72 months) 
and also in a post hoc analysis of children who 
were 6 to less than 24 months of age. The latter 
finding is noteworthy because evidence of the ef- 
ficacy of TIV in children younger than 24 months 
of age is limited.10,11,22 
Since the results of this study were principally 
from year 2, when vaccine-like H3N2 viruses pre- 
dominated (in 94 of 110 culture-confirmed cases), 



























































































the reported overall vaccine efficacy is, in effect, 
an H3N2-specific observation.23 Only 12 infections 
with influenza B virus occurred, all involving 
strains that were not characterized for vaccine 
matching or that were lineage-mismatched to the 
vaccine strains, so the B virus–specific efficacy of 
ATIV and TIV could not be meaningfully assessed 
(observed efficacy, 79% [95% CI, −5 to 96] and 
36% [95% CI, −162 to 84], respectively). B-lineage 
mismatches present a greater obstacle to vaccine 
efficacy than do mismatches due to antigenic drift 
because cross-lineage hemagglutination-inhibition 
antibodies are not effectively induced by vaccina- 
tion, especially in children in whom priming has 
not been carried out.1,24-26 
Immune responses to ATIV were significantly 
greater than immune responses to TIV and were 
maintained for up to 181 days, both against ho- 
mologous (vaccine) and heterologous strains. Be- 
cause children under 9 years of age need to receive 
two priming doses of TIV, it was notable that 
responses to a single ATIV dose met the conven- 
tional seroprotection threshold (hemagglutina- 
tion-inhibition antibody titer ≥40) for both A-sub- 
type viruses, a finding that is consistent with 
previous observations of seasonal and pandemic 
influenza vaccines with the MF59 adjuvant.1,18,27-31 
Although responses to B strains were lower, 88 to 
99% of all children had titers of 40 or higher after 
two doses of ATIV, as compared with 19 to 60% 
of TIV recipients. Low responses to the B strain 
in children are of particular concern, since this 
age group has a disproportionate share of influ- 
enza B virus infections.1,32 Moreover, B strains are 
frequently responsible for late-season (spring) in- 
fluenza outbreaks, so the high proportion of chil- 
dren with seroprotective hemagglutination-inhi- 
bition antibody titers at day 181 (64%) and the 
maintenance of vaccine efficacy through the end 
of the influenza season are potential advantages 
of ATIV over TIV, particularly with the start of vac- 
cine deliveries and immunizations in August.24,30,33 
In previous studies of seasonal and H5N1 vac- 
cines, formulations that included the MF59 adju- 
vant elicited higher levels of cross-reactive anti- 
bodies to antigenically related viruses than did 
their counterparts without the adjuvant.18,19,34,35 
We confirmed this observation in the current 
study for heterovariant A-subtype strains, includ- 
ing an H3N2 strain that did not circulate exten- 
sively in the Northern Hemisphere until after the 
study’s completion — a prospective benefit when 
vaccine and circulating viruses are mismatched. 
Since the H3N2 viruses circulating in the second 
study year were vaccinelike, there was no oppor- 
tunity to show clinical efficacy against a drift 
variant. 
Vaccine-related adverse events were generally 
mild to moderate in both age cohorts, with no 
important differences in solicited reactogenic 
events among the three vaccine groups after ei- 
ther dose in the younger cohort. In older children, 
systemic reactions, including mild fever, were 
slightly more frequent after receipt of ATIV, as 
compared with the other vaccines, but these re- 
actions were mostly mild and of short duration. 
Similarly, rates of unsolicited adverse events and 
serious adverse events were not disproportionate 
in the ATIV group, confirming previous experi- 
ence with various vaccines having the MF59 ad- 
juvant in trials involving approximately 33,000 
children ranging in age from neonates to teen- 
agers under 17 years of age.18,19,36,37 Although 
clinically controlled experience with MF59 in chil- 
dren is limited, information from the commer- 
cial distribution of more than 50 million Fluad 
doses since 1997 for administration in elderly per- 
sons, as well as interim observations from ap- 
proximately 100 million doses of pandemic influ- 
enza A (H1N1) vaccines with the MF59 adjuvant 
that were distributed in 2009–2010 in all age 
groups (and also in pregnant women), has not re- 
vealed any safety concerns.38-40 
In this controlled trial, the efficacy of an in- 
activated influenza vaccine in children 6 to less 
than 72 months of age was relatively high. Since 
protection was principally against the subtype 
H3N2 virus, no conclusions could be reached with 
regard to the efficacy of ATIV or TIV against H1N1 
and B viruses. The immunogenicity analysis in- 
dicated that ATIV elicits higher, more persistent, 
and more cross-reactive antibody responses than 
TIV. There was no opportunity to confirm the 
clinical effect of the heterovariant antibodies. 
The modest efficacy of TIV against matched 
strains (45%) in our study is consistent with the 
results of previous studies in children 1 to 5 years 
of age (44 to 49%) and in children 6 to 24 months 
of age (66% [95% CI, 34 to 82] in the first year 
and −7% [95% CI, −247 to 67] in the second year), 
as well as with the results of most effectiveness 
studies.10-12,22,25,27,28,41 In infants 6 to 59 months 
of age, administration of a live attenuated influ- 
enza vaccine led to 54.9% fewer cases of culture- 






confirmed influenza, as compared with TIV; 
however, live attenuated influenza vaccine is not 
indicated for children under 24 months of age or 
for older children with a history of wheezing.13,14 
The use of TIV with the MF59 adjuvant, which we 
studied, is a potentially effective option for chil- 
dren 6 to less than 72 months of age, with the 
additional potential advantages of increased het- 
erovariant coverage, a longer duration of protec- 
tion, and, for some strains, protection after a sin- 
gle dose.
