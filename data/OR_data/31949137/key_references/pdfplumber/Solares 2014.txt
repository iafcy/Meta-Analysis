Abstract
Introduction: The efficacy of non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine in young children is considered to be suboptimal. This study
compared the safety and immunogenicity profiles of MF59-adjuvanted, trivalent, influenza vaccine (ATIV) and non-adjuvanted, trivalent,
influenza vaccine (TIV) in Guatemalan children (N = 360) between 6 and < 60 months of age.
Methodology: Children received two doses of ATIV or TIV administered four weeks apart. Solicited adverse reactions were recorded for
seven days after each vaccination. Serious adverse events were recorded throughout the entire study period. Antibody responses were
assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay at baseline, four weeks after administration of the first vaccine dose, and three weeks after
administration of the second dose.
Results: Both ATIV and TIV were well tolerated, with similar rates of solicited reactions and adverse events observed in response to both
vaccines. MF59-adjuvanted vaccine induced considerably higher antibody titers than did TIV. After two doses, the B strain-specific antibody
response to TIV was insufficient to meet the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) licensure criterion for seroprotection,
whereas responses to the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine met the seroprotection criterion against all three strains. Cross-reactive antibody
responses to MF59-adjuvanted vaccine met the CBER seroprotection criterion against all three strains after two doses; B strain-specific
heterologous responses to non-adjuvanted TIV were inadequate.
Conclusions: The MF59-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine was well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in children 6 to < 60 months of
age, inducing seroprotective antibody titers against both the vaccine strains and antigenically distinct heterologous strains.

the suboptimal antibody titers observed in response to
non-adjuvanted TIV in the pediatric population. As
well as decreasing required antigen content per dose
and promoting long-term antibody persistence [15],
MF59 has been shown to enhance levels of
heterologous immunity by heightening cross-reactive
antibody responses in vaccinees of all ages [16-23].
The good safety profile of MF59-adjuvanted influenza
vaccines is well established [24-27].
In order to evaluate the possible benefits of
adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine in children
under five years of age compared with non-adjuvanted
vaccine, this study assessed the safety and
immunogenicity profiles of ATIV compared with non-
adjuvanted, split TIV in healthy Guatemalan children.
Vaccine antigen-specific (homologous) and cross-
reactive (heterologous) antibody responses were
analyzed after first and second vaccine doses by at baseline (day 1), four weeks after administration of
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay according to the first vaccine dose (day 29), and three weeks after
