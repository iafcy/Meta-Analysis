beenestablishedinpreviousstudiesleadingtorecommendations

Epidemiologicalstudieshaveconsistentlyshownhighratesof

Based on such evidences, the US Advisory Committee on Immu-

dationstoincludeallchildrenaged6–59monthsinJune2006,and
furtherextendingtoallchildrenandadolescentsaged5–18years

The current European situation is quite different. Finland has
introducedroutineimmunizationof6–35month-oldchildrenas

survey). Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia and Slovenia recommend rou-
tine immunization of children (with the age limits varying from
6 months to 5 years of age) and Austria recommends influenza
vaccinationforallagegroups[4].
Aninherentassumptionofexpandedvaccinationrecommenda-
tionsisthatcurrentlyavailableinfluenzavaccinesareefficacious
in preventing clinical influenza disease. Although studies have
documented immune responses following two doses of TIVs,
immunogenicitydata,especiallyvs.theBinfluenzastrain,aregen-
