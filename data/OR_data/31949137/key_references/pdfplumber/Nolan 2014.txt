Background: Non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines show only modest efficacy in young children.
This study compared the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of the MF59®-adjuvanted trivalent
subunit vaccine (aTIV) with two non-adjuvanted trivalent vaccines, TIV-1, the non-adjuvanted version
of aTIV, and TIV-2, a split virion vaccine.
Methods: 6078 children received two doses of aTIV (n = 3125), TIV-1 (n = 1479), or TIV-2 (n = 1474) four
weeks apart (Days 1 and 29). Children aged 6 to <36 months and 36 to <72 months received 0.25 mL and
0.50 mL doses, respectively. Immunogenicity was assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay
(n = 2435) on Days 1, 29, 50 and 209. Safety was assessed up to Day 394.
Results: After the second vaccination (Day 50), the aTIV group showed significantly higher geometric mean
HI titers and seroconversion rates than the TIV-1 or TIV-2 groups against all homologous and heterologous
strains. The difference was enhanced at HI titers ≥110. aTIV elicited a faster, more persistent antibody
response, with significantly higher titers in the aTIV group after one vaccination (Day 29) and after six
months (Day 209) than in either TIV group. aTIV was more reactogenic than were TIV-1 and TIV-2 but
rates of severe adverse events were very low for all three vaccines.
Conclusion: In infants and young children, the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine induced substantially faster
(after one dose), higher, persistent HI titers than the non-adjuvanted vaccines, with consistently higher
seroprotection rates at increased threshold HI titers.
This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01346592.

Introduction
Influenza rates are highest in children, with young children,
especially those under two years old, constituting one of the
high-risk groups for infection and associated complications [1–5].
Most influenza infections in children are self-limiting, but influenza
may be severe, particularly in young children and those with
chronic medical conditions [3].

In the US, annual influenza vaccination has been recommended
for all children from six months to 18 years of age since the
2008–2009 influenza season, when there were 90 million new
cases of influenza worldwide in children under five years old [6,7].
However, vaccine coverage rates among children are relatively
low: according to the US Centers for Disease Control only about
40% of children received an influenza vaccine in 2012–2013 [8].
One of the reasons for this poor uptake is that healthcare pro-
fessionals consider currently available non-adjuvanted seasonal
influenza vaccines to only have modest efficacy in young children
[9,10].
The influenza virus evolves rapidly, evading immune responses
by antigenic shift and drift leading to frequent emergence of novel
strains [11]. Thus vaccines developed for seasonal influenza often
contain mismatched strains to the ones circulating in the popu-
lation the following year, further reducing vaccine effectiveness
[12,13]. Most licenced influenza vaccines are inactivated vaccines,
with split virion and subunit vaccines having been administered
to millions of people worldwide. Split vaccines are generated
by disruption of the inactivated whole virion using detergents
whereas subunit vaccines are enriched for hemagglutinin (HA)
and neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoproteins [14]. Enhanced anti-
body responses to seasonal influenza vaccines have been shown
using MF59®, an oil-in-water emulsion containing squalene, as
an adjuvant [15–17]. MF59 acts locally by activating monocytes,
macrophages and dendritic cells, which release a mixture of
cytokines attracting phagocytic cells to the injection site, result-
ing in more efficient antigen-transport to the lymph nodes [18,19].
MF59 has also been shown to enhance the immune response
by increasing the binding strength of antibody to the influenza
virus [16,17] Influenza vaccines containing MF59 have also con-
sistently demonstrated an established safety profile [20–23]. The
MF59-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine, Fluad®, is recom-
mended in numerous countries for adults over the age of 65,
but further research is particularly necessary to assess the effec-
tiveness and safety of inclusion of MF59 adjuvant in seasonal
vaccines for children. In this study we compared the immunogenic-
ity against both homologous and heterologous influenza strains,
reactogenicity and safety of an MF59-adjuvanted trivalent vac-
cine, aTIV (a subunit vaccine), with that of two non-adjuvanted
trivalent influenza vaccines, TIV-1 (the non-adjuvanted version of
aTIV) and TIV-2 (a split particle vaccine) in children aged 6 to <72
months.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study design and objectives
This Phase III, observer-blind, stratified, randomized study was
conducted at eight sites in Argentina, five in Australia, two in
Chile, 12 in The Philippines, and five in South Africa, between April
2011 and July 2012. The primary immunogenicity objective was
to demonstrate the non-inferior immunogenicity of two doses of
aTIV compared with TIV-1 and TIV-2, measured by seroconversion
rates and geometric mean titers (GMTs) against three homologous
strains, in children aged 6 to <72 months. An additional primary
objective was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of two doses of
TIV-1 to TIV-2 in children aged 6 to <36 months. Secondary objec-
tives were: to demonstrate the superiority of aTIV to TIV-1 and
TIV-2 against homologous strains in children aged 6 to <24 months
and 6 to <72 months, to evaluate immunogenicity against het-
erologous strains in children aged 6 to <72 months, and to assess
reactogenicity and safety of all three vaccines. The protocol was
approved by Ethics Review Committees in each institution, and the
study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
and
Helsinki
the principles of Good Clinical Practice. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from the parents/legal guardians of all children
before enrolment. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov:
NCT01346592.
2.2. Children
6104 healthy children aged from 6 to <72 months were enrolled.
The main exclusion criteria were: history of Guillain–Barré syn-
drome or severe convulsion; fatal prognosis for an underlying
medical condition; history of serious vaccine reactions; hypersensi-
tivity to any vaccine component; receipt of another investigational
agent within four weeks prior to enrollment or before comple-
tion of the study; impairment/alteration of immune function; fever
(≥38.0◦C); receipt of licensed vaccines within 14 days (inacti-
vated) or 28 days (live attenuated) prior to enrolment; planned
surgery.
2.3. Study procedures
Children were stratified into three age groups (6 to <24 months,
24 to <36 months and 36 to <72 months) and randomly assigned
using a web-based system to receive aTIV, TIV-1 or TIV-2, with
allocation ratios 3:2:2 (6 to <24 months and 24 to <36 months)
or 4:1:1 (36 to <72 months). Vaccines were administered on Days
1 and 29: children aged 6 to <36 months received a 0.25 mL dose
and children aged 36 to <72 months received a 0.5 mL dose. For
immunogenicity analyses, a subset (n = 2655) of children from each
age and vaccine group was used. Blood samples (5 mL) were col-
lected at baseline (Day 1), prior to the second vaccination (Day
29), and 21 (Day 50) and 180 (Day 209) days after the second
vaccination. Subject disposition and study design are illustrated in
Fig. 1.
2.4. Vaccines
A single 0.5 mL dose of the trivalent MF59®-adjuvanted
seasonal egg-derived subunit vaccine, aTIV (Fluad®, Novartis
Vaccines) (Lots: A52P14H1A/A52P15H1A/A52P16H1A/B52D21N1/
B52D21N1A/B52D21N1B), the trivalent seasonal egg-derived
subunit vaccine, TIV-1 (Agriflu®, Novartis Vaccines) (Lots:
B51D01N1/B51D04N1A/B51D04N1B), and the trivalent sea-
sonal egg-derived split vaccine TIV-2 (Fluzone®, Sanofi Pasteur)
(Lots: U3792BA/U3641BA), all contained 15 (cid:2)g of each of
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) and
B/Brisbane/60/2008 hemagglutinin (HA), as recommended by
the World Health Organization for the Southern Hemisphere
influenza season 2011. All vaccines were injected intramuscularly
into the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm, using a one inch
Luer lock needle.
2.5. Immunogenicity assessment
Blood samples were collected by venipuncture, centrifuged,
immediately stored at −18◦C or below and later transported to
the Novartis Vaccines Clinical Sciences Laboratory in Marburg,
Germany, where antibody responses against both homologous and
heterologous strains were assessed, in terms of GMTs, serocon-
version and seroprotection rates, by hemagglutination inhibition
(HI), based on the methods of Stephenson et al. [24]. Cross-reactive
antibody responses were tested against the following heterolo-
gous strains: A/New Jersey/8/1976 (H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007
(H3N2) and B/Malaysia/2506/2004. All three heterologous strains
were found to be antigenically distinct (>4–8 fold difference) from
the vaccine strains, when analyzed using antibody responses to fer-
ret antisera: >64-fold difference in HI for the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2

strains, and a >16-fold difference for the B strains [25]. Alignment
of the HA sequences between the vaccine strain and the heterolo-
gous subtype test strain show the following percentages of identity:
90.6% (A/H1N1), 94.9% (A/H3N2) and 99% (B strain). HI titers
were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution at which
hemagglutination was totally inhibited. Seroconversion (or signif-
icant increase) was defined as: Day 50 HI titers ≥40 for children
seronegative at baseline [HI titer <10] or a minimum 4-fold
increase in HI titer by Day 50 for children seropositive at base-
line [HI titer ≥10]. Seroprotection rates were also estimated at
higher threshold HI titers (≥110 to ≥629), which have been
shown to be a more meaningful correlate of protection in children
[23].
2.6. Reactogenicity and safety assessment
Children were observed for approximately 30 min after vaccina-
tion for immediate reactions. Solicited local and systemic adverse
reactions up to Day 7 and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) up to Day
50 were recorded on diary cards by the child’s parent or guardian.
All serious AEs (SAEs), AEs of special interest (AESIs), new onset
chronic
of
disease (NOCD) and AEs leading to study withdrawal were
collected up to Day 394.
2.7. Statistical analysis
2.7.1. Data sets
The per-protocol set (PPS) was used to analyze the non-
inferiority objective, i.e. children who were vaccinated and
had no major protocol violations. For persistence of response,
the full analysis persistence set was used, i.e. children who
were vaccinated and provided evaluable sera at all time points.
For cross-reactive antibody response, the heterologous full
analysis persistence set was used. For all other analyses, the full
analysis set (FAS) was used, i.e. children who were vaccinated
and provided evaluable sera at Days 1 and 50. Vaccine group
differences in seroconversion and seroprotection at increasing
threshold HI titers were estimated using a categorical model with
adjustment for age strata; ratios between vaccine group GMTs,
referred to throughout as GMT ratios, were estimated using a
general linear model with adjustment for age strata and baseline
titer.

2.7.2. Statistical significance
A significantly higher response was concluded if, for GMTs, the
lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) around the group
ratio was >1.0, and, for seroconversion rates, if the lower bound
of the 95% CI (Clopper–Pearson) around the group difference
was >0%.
2.7.3. Non-inferiority
Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower bound of
multiplicity-adjusted two-sided CI (97.6% for aTIV and 97.4%
for TIV-1 non-inferiority objectives) exceeded the corresponding
margin (0.667 for the GMTs and -10% for seroconversion) in all 12
comparisons for aTIV versus both TIVs (2 endpoints × 3 strains × 2
comparators), and in all six comparisons for TIV-1 versus TIV-2 (2
endpoints × 3 strains).
2.7.4. Superiority
Superiority was concluded if the multiplicity adjusted one-sided
p-value was ≤1.2% for two out of three strains, with superiority
margins of 1.5 for group GMT ratios and 10% for group differences
in seroconversion

rates.
Reactogenicity and safety
Reactogenicity and safety data were evaluated descriptively
and expressed as the percentage of children with adverse
reactions/events in each group, which were categorized as mild,
moderate or severe. AEs were also classed as not related, possibly
related or probably related to study vaccination.
3. Results
3.1. Study population
Of the 6104 children enrolled in the study, 6100 were ran-
domized and 6078 were vaccinated: 3125 children received
aTIV, 1479 children received TIV-1, and 1474 children received
TIV-2. Demographic and other characteristics were balanced
between the vaccine groups (Table 1), except for mean age, which
was higher in the aTIV group. This imbalance was addressed
in immunogenicity analyses by statistical adjustment for age
group.

3.2. Immunogenicity
3.2.1. Responses to homologous strains
By Day 29, children in the aTIV group had significantly higher
GMTs and seroconversion rates against all homologous strains
than children in either the TIV-1 or the TIV-2 groups (Fig. 2,
Supplementary Table). The difference in GMTs between aTIV and
the TIVs had increased by Day 50 and remained significantly higher
six months after vaccination. For children aged 6 to <72 months,
aTIV met the statistical criteria for non-inferiority to both TIVs
against all three strains, for both GMT ratios and seroconversion
rates at Day 50 (Table 2). aTIV also met the pre-defined superiority
threshold against both TIVs in terms of GMTs, but not in terms
of seroconversion rates. For the subset of youngest children (6
to <24 months), aTIV achieved superiority to TIV-1 in both GMTs
and seroconversion rates (Table 3). GMT ratios between aTIV
and TIV-2 were significantly higher than the superiority margin
(p-value <0.0001) but differences in seroconversion rates did not
meet the 10% threshold for superiority against any strain in this
subset.
For the entire study population, the magnitude of the difference
in seroprotection between aTIV and the TIVs was statistically sig-
nificant at the ≥40 threshold titer, and increased at higher titers,
with the largest differences seen at titers of ≥330 and above for the
A strains, and of ≥110 and above for the B strain (Fig. 3). All differ-
ences at titers of ≥110 and above were significant (p < 0.01) for all
homologous strains.
Although there was evidence of TIV-1 being non-inferior to
TIV-2 in terms of both seroconversion rates and GMTs for the
A/H3N2 and B strains, non-inferiority was not met for the A/H1N1
strain in terms of either seroconversion rate or GMTs (Table 4),
hence the overall non-inferiority as defined in study objec-
tive (i.e. non-inferiority met for all six measures) could not be
concluded.
3.2.2. Responses to heterologous strains
When tested against all three heterologous strains, significantly
higher GMTs and seroconversion rates were seen in the aTIV group
compared with TIV groups at all time points post-vaccination,
except at Day 29 against the A/H1N1 strain for aTIV compared
with TIV-1 (Fig. 4, Supplementary Table). The greatest differences
between aTIV and the two comparator vaccines were observed
against the heterologous A/H3N2 strain after one vaccination (Day
29), and against the heterologous B strain following the complete
two-vaccination schedule (Day 50).
3.3. Reactogenicity
Reported solicited adverse reactions were generally mild to
moderate and transient in nature. More of the older children (36
to <72 months) in the aTIV group reported local adverse reaction,
including injection site pain, than in either TIV group (Table 5). After
the first vaccination, more of the older children in the aTIV group
reported solicited systemic adverse reactions, including fever, than
in the other vaccine groups, though the rates of fever in the
youngest age group was similar across the vaccine groups (Table 6).
After the second vaccination, similar levels of systemic adverse
reactions were recorded across all vaccine groups, but the inci-
dence of fever remained slightly higher in the aTIV group for all
age groups. While low, the rate of severe reactions among children
in the aTIV group (0.38%) was also higher than in the TIV-1 (0.07%)
or TIV-2 (0.14%) groups.

set.**p < 0.01,***p < 0.001.
3.4. Safety
Overall, fewer children experienced unsolicited AEs in the aTIV
group (49%) than in the TIV-1 (55%) or TIV-2 (58%) groups. No
individual AE was reported as at least possibly related to study
vaccination by >1% of children in any vaccine group. The most fre-
quent AEs reported are all commonly seen in pediatric populations
(Table 7).
There were eight deaths in the study: one in the aTIV group, four
in the TIV-1 group, and three in the TIV-2 group. None was consid-
ered to be related to study vaccination. Two other children (both
TIV-2 group) experienced AEs leading to study withdrawal; neither
was considered related to study vaccination. SAEs were reported
by 4% of children in the aTIV and TIV-2 groups and 5% of
in
children
the TIV-1 group. A total of 27 children across vaccine groups
experienced febrile convulsion during the study. One event was
considered possibly related to vaccination: this occurred in a child
in the aTIV group on Day 2, lasted less than a day, and was of mild
severity.
4. Discussion
Currently available non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines
have only modest efficacy in young children [8]. Addition of the
MF59 adjuvant has been shown to enhance protection against
influenza in another high-risk group, the elderly [18,27,28]. As
young children are the second largest group at risk of compli-

immunogenicity and safety of an MF59-adjuvanted influenza vac-
cine (aTIV) with two non-adjuvanted vaccines in young children.
While a prior study has demonstrated the efficacy of aTIV in
young children [29], here we present the first large scale phase III
study evaluating the immunogenicity and safety of aTIV versus US
licensed comparator vaccines in children 6 to <72 months of age,
including a one year safety follow-up.
In this study, aTIV elicited significantly higher GMTs and
seroconversion rates by Day 50 than either TIV vaccine, for all vac-
cine strains. This substantially enhanced immunogenicity mirrors
results from previous studies comparing aTIV with non-adjuvanted
inactivated influenza vaccines in young children, indicating an
immunogenicity benefit of adjuvanted vaccines for this age group,
when assessed at the conventional threshold antibody titer (≥40)
[23,30].
As demonstrated by Black et al. [26] an HI titer ≥40 in children
aged 6 to <72 months was associated with a population clinical
protection level (against the A/H3N2 strain) of 22%, whereas a
higher threshold HI titer of ≥110 was associated with the con-
ventional 50% clinical protection rate against infection and titers
of 215, 330, and 629 predicted protection rates of 70%, 80%, and
90%, respectively [31,32]. In our study, percentages of children with
HI titers ≥215, ≥330 and ≥629 were significantly higher in the
aTIV group than in either TIV group. The magnitude of the dif-
ferences increased at higher titers, especially against the B strain,
where a large difference between aTIV and TIVs was seen at titers
of ≥110 and above. Thus the enhanced immunogenicity of aTIV
was more pronounced at titers that may represent more mean-
ingful correlates of clinical protection from influenza for this age
group.
The increased antibody response to aTIV was evident after a sin-
gle dose (measured on Day 29). As many influenza vaccine-naïve
children do not complete the recommended two-dose vaccination
schedule, the increased immunogenicity of aTIV would poten-
tially increase protection against seasonal influenza in this age
group [33]. In addition, aTIV elicited a persistent antibody response,
echoing results from Vesikari et al., who found that the pro-
portion of children with seroprotective antibody titers remained
significantly higher for the adjuvanted vaccine six months after
initial vaccination [23]. Although our study did not evaluate vac-
cine efficacy, both the significantly higher antibody response after
one vaccine dose, together with the sustained response to Day
209, following the complete two-vaccination schedule, suggest a
potential enhanced efficacy of aTIV in young children. Although
non-adjuvanted vaccines have a long track record of use in children,
they do not appear to induce satisfactory protective antibod- ies in unprimed children, especially the very young, and against
influenza B strains [34,35]. Furthermore, influenza B frequently
occurs in late season outbreaks, so the persistence of higher HI titers, and the maintenance of seroprotection until the end of the
influenza season suggests more prolonged protection against this
strain.
As the influenza virus evolves very rapidly, often there is anti-
genic mismatch between circulating strains and those included
in vaccines [36]. Therefore, a seasonal vaccine needs to be able
to induce a broad cross-reactive antibody response against anti-
genically distinct influenza strains to increase the likelihood of
protection against current strains. aTIV induced significantly higher
antibody responses than either TIV, against all three heterologous
strains, with the largest differences after a single vaccine dose (on
Day 29) being seen against the heterologous A/H3N2 strain. The
heterologous strains evaluated in this study, when tested against
ferret anti-sera, had a >64-fold difference in HI from the vaccine
strains for the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains and a >16-fold difference
for the B strains: it is possible that the magnitude of cross-
reactive response may differ against a more distantly related strain.

Similarly, a previous study in 6 to <36 month old children showed
aTIV induced significantly higher GMTs against heterologous
strains than the comparator TIV, with the highest antibody titers for
the A/H3N2 strain [29]. A/H3N2 is known to have greater antigenic
variability than the other two strains included in seasonal influenza
vaccines, therefore an effective cross-reactive antibody response

strain could provide increased efficacy against future circulat-
ing strains [12,37].
Solicited adverse reaction rates were highest in the aTIV group,
which is in agreement with other studies on aTIVs in this age
group [20,23,29]. In addition, rates of mild fever were similar to
those found by Vesikari et al., who also reported higher rates of

fever in 36 to <72 month old recipients of aTIV [23,29]. Although
some adjuvanted influenza vaccines have been linked to narcolepsy
[38], there is no evidence to date of an association between MF59-
adjuvanted vaccine receipt and narcolepsy [39,40]. In addition,
case
no
of narcolepsy was reported in this study. Overall, despite the
higher reactogenicity, the number of children completing the study
was similar for all vaccine groups, and the enhanced immunogenic-
ity of aTIV can be seen to offset the increase in mild to moderate
transient reactions experienced from the use of this vaccine.
In summary, this study demonstrates that aTIV, a trivalent
MF59-adjuvanted seasonal subunit influenza vaccine, induced
significantly higher antibody titers in young children than non-
adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines, even after the first dose.
The superior antibody responses after two doses of aTIV remained
significantly higher than responses to the TIVs for six months
after vaccination, against both homologous and heterologous A
and B strains. This higher response was more pronounced when
tested at increasing threshold antibody titers, which may be more
appropriate for this age group. Thus, despite the increased reac-
togenicity, aTIV may therefore provide enhanced protection in
children aged 6 to <72 months against both homologous and het-
erologous influenza strains.
