efficacy in the 6 through 23-month subgroup was significantly greater for aIIV4 than for the comparator vaccine
(relative vaccine efficacy 31·37, 95% CI 3·14–51·38). aIIV4 elicited superior immunogenic response compared with
the comparator for all four vaccine strains (geometric mean titre ratios 1·91 [95% CI 1·8–2·0] for A/H1N1,
1·71 [1·6–1·8] for A/H3N2, 2·19 [2·0–2·4] for B/Yamagata, and 2·27 [2·0–2·6] for B/Victoria) and three heterologous
strains (1·94 [1·6–2·3] for A/H3N2, 2·17 [1·8–2·6] for B/Yamagata, and 2·12 [1·6–2·7] for B/Victoria) in participants
aged 6 months through 5 years. The highest geometric mean titre ratios were observed in participants aged 6 through
23 months. Safety profiles were similar but more frequent solicited adverse events were reported with aIIV4 than with
the comparator (3748 [73%] of 5138 vs 3242 [64%] of 5056).
Interpretation Although there was no additional benefit of aIIV4 compared with the US-licensed non-adjuvanted
influenza vaccines in the overall study population, in the youngest and most vulnerable population of children in this
trial, aIIV4 provided greater protection against influenza than a non-adjuvanted vaccine when assessed in this
prespecified age group of 6 through 23 months. Additional clinical benefit was also apparent early after first
vaccination in vaccine-naive participants aged 6 months through 5 years. Finally, aIIV4 and comparator had similar
efficacy and vaccine safety profiles in children aged 6 months through 5 years.
