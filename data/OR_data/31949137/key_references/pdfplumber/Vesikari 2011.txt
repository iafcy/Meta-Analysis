Results
Attack rates of influenza-like illness across both influenza seasons were 0.7%, 2.8%,
and 4.7% in the adjuvant, nonadjuvant, and control vaccine groups, respectively. The
absolute vaccine efficacy rates against all influenza strains (94 of 110 cases were
due to vaccine-matched H3N2 viruses) were 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74 to
93) for the MF59-adjuvant vaccine (ATIV) and 43% (95% CI, 15 to 61) for the vaccine
without the adjuvant (TIV); the relative vaccine efficacy rate for ATIV versus TIV was
75% (95% CI, 55 to 87). The efficacy rates for ATIV were 79% (95% CI, 55 to 90) in
children 6 to less than 36 months of age and 92% (95% CI, 77 to 97) in those 36 to
less than 72 months of age, as compared with 40% (95% CI, −6 to 66) and 45%
(95% CI, 6 to 68), respectively, for TIV. Antibody responses were higher with ATIV
and remained so through day 181. The rates of systemic and local reactions to the
influenza vaccines with and without the adjuvant were similar in the younger age
group (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.09), but systemic events in the older age
group were more frequent after administration of ATIV (63%) than after adminis-
tration of TIV (44%) or the control vaccine (50%). Serious adverse events were dis-
tributed evenly across the three vaccine groups.
Conclusions
Influenza vaccine with the MF59 adjuvant is efficacious against PCR-confirmed
influenza in infants and young children. (Funded by Novartis Vaccines and Diag-
nostics; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00644059.)

had almost no efficacy (2%) (95% CI, −129 to 58).
The time–cumulative efficacy calculations showed
that the estimates of vaccine efficacy for ATIV and
TIV were robust throughout the 5-month surveil-

Figure 3. Seroprotective Hemagglutination-Inhibition (HI) Antibody Titers, According to Age Group, Vaccine Group, and Virus Strain.
Results are shown for children 6 to less than 36 months of age (Panel A) and for children 36 to less than 72 months of age (Panel B).
Responses are shown before vaccination, at 29 days (4 weeks after the first dose), at 50 days (4 weeks after the second dose), and at
6 months after vaccination. HI antibody titers of 40 or higher were considered to be seroprotective.
