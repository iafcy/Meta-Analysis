(black), IL-13+ (white) and TNF-α + (striped) CD4+ T lymphocytes after overnight, in vitro, stimulation of PBMCs with
influenza antigens homologous and heterologous to the vaccine. The bars represent the number of antigen-specific CD4+ T
lymphocytes/106 total CD4+ T lymphocytes at day 1 and day 50. The pies represent the relative proportion of each cytokine
producing CD4+ T lymphocytes at day 50. All analyses were done using the PPS.
