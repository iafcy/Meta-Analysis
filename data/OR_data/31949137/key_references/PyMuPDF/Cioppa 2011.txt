Young
 children
 are  at  increased
 risk  for  inﬂuenza
 infections
 and  related
 complications.
 The
 protection
offered
 to children
 by  conventional
 trivalent
 inactivated
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 (TIV)  is suboptimal,
 due
to
 poor
 immunogenicity
 and  a  higher  exposure
 to  infection
 and  complications
 in  this  age  group,
 par-
ticularly
 from  inﬂuenza
 B strains.  In this  dose-ranging,
 factorial
 design
 trial,  we  report  the
 safety
 and
immunogenicity
 of  different
 combinations
 of  adjuvanted
 (ATIV)
 and  non-adjuvanted
 trivalent
 (TIV)  and
quadrivalent
 (QIV)  inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 in  480  healthy
 children
 6 to  <36  months
 of  age.
The
 results  show  that the  second
 B strain  added
 to  TIV  was  immunogenic
 and  did  not
 affect
 immuno-
genicity
 of  the  other  strains.
 The
 addition
 of  the
 MF59® adjuvant
 promoted
 robust  immune
 responses
 with
notable
 elevations
 in  antibodies
 observed
 even
 after
 one  dose.  A  dose–response
 relationship
 was
 observed
between
 the  antibody
 response
 and  MF59  adjuvant.
 No  patterns
 in  safety
 and  tolerability
 emerged  with
different
 adjuvant
 and
 antigen
 doses  nor  with  the  addition
 of  a  second
 B strain.

 Introduction
Inﬂuenza
 is
 associated
 with
 substantial
 morbidity
 in
 children
[1,2],
 who
 also
 play
 a
 major
 role
 in
 the
 transmission
 and
 spread
of
 inﬂuenza
 in
 households
 and
 the
 community
 during
 epidemics
[3,4].
 Vaccination
 of
 children
 against
 inﬂuenza
 brings
 important
health
 beneﬁts,
 directly
 to
 the
 children
 themselves
 and
 indirectly
to
 persons
 in
 other
 age
 groups,
 by
 helping
 to
 control
 the
 spread
of
 inﬂuenza
 [5,6].
 However,
 meta-analyses
 reveal
 that
 immune
responses
 conferred
 by
 conventional,
 nonadjuvanted,
 trivalent
inactivated
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 (TIVs)
 do
 not
 appear
 to
 effectively
induce
 protective
 antibodies
 in
 young
 unprimed
 children,
 resulting
in
 only
 modest
 efﬁcacy
 [7].  This
 trend
 appears
 particularly
 evident
for
 the
 inﬂuenza
 B
 strain
 for
 which
 conventional
 nonadjuvanted
vaccines
 generally
 exhibit
 lower
 immunogenicity
 to
 the
 B
 strain
than
 to
 the
 inﬂuenza
 A
 antigens
 [8],  although
 this
 may
 also
 be

consequence
 of
 lower
 sensitivity
 for
 antibodies
 to
 the
 B
 strain
 in
the
 standard
 test
 [9].  Immune
 responses
 in
 young
 children
 can,
however,
 be
 effectively
 enhanced
 with
 the
 use
 of
 the
 oil-in-water
emulsion
 adjuvant
 MF59® (Novartis
 Vaccines
 and
 Diagnostics)
 [8].
Since
 the
 early
 1980s,
 two
 antigenically
 dissimilar
 strains
 of
inﬂuenza
 B
 virus
 have
 been
 present
 in
 the
 human
 population,
one
 lineage
 represented
 by
 B/Victoria/2/87-like
 and
 the
 other
by
 B/Yamagata/16/88-like
 viruses
 [10]. Notably,
 since
 1988,
 both
have
 simultaneously
 been
 associated
 with
 signiﬁcant
 numbers
 of
infections
 in
 various
 locations
 worldwide
 [10,11].  A recent
 study
demonstrated
 that
 inﬂuenza
 B
 infections
 accounted
 for
 approxi-
mately
 one
 ﬁfth
 of
 all
 inﬂuenza-related
 hospitalizations
 in
 children
under
 16
 years
 of
 age
 in
 Finland
 [12]. Moreover,
 proportionately
more
 inﬂuenza
 B
 strain
 infections
 occur
 in
 children
 compared
 with
older
 populations
 [13].
 In
 5
 of
 the
 past
 10
 inﬂuenza
 seasons
 in
 the
United
 States
 (2001–2010),
 the
 predominant
 circulating
 inﬂuenza
B
 virus
 lineage
 did
 not
 match
 the
 strain
 contained
 in
 the
 vac-
cine
 [14].
 Hence,
 as
 two
 inﬂuenza
 B
 virus
 lineages
 cocirculate,
 and
there
 is
 little
 cross-protection
 between
 the
 two
 lineages
 [15,16],
the
 protection
 offered
 by
 only
 one
 B
 virus
 lineage
 in
 each
 year’s
 TIV
exposes
 children
 to
 insufﬁcient
 protection
 in
 case
 of
 a
 mismatch
[17–19].
 Recent
 observations
 of
 inﬂuenza
 trends
 demonstrate
 that

in
 years
 in
 which
 the
 recommended
 inﬂuenza
 B
 strain
 in
 TIV
 is
poorly
 matched
 to
 the
 circulating
 B
 strain,
 up
 to
 29%
 of
 inﬂuenza
cases
 in
 a
 population
 might
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
 circulation
 of
 the
other
 inﬂuenza
 B
 strain
 which
 had
 not
 been
 included
 in
 the
 vaccine
[20].
 A
 potential
 strategy
 to
 cover
 this
 still
 unmet
 medical
 need
 is
 a
quadrivalent
 formulation
 that
 includes
 a
 second
 B
 strain
 from
 the
alternative
 lineage.
The
 present
 study
 in
 healthy
 children
 6
 to
 <36
 months
 of
 age
 is
a
 dose-ranging
 factorial
 design
 trial
 to
 evaluate
 the
 safety,
 tolera-
bility
 and
 immunogenicity
 of
 different
 vaccine
 formulations
 with
different
 doses
 of
 MF59
 adjuvant
 and/or
 a
 second
 B
 strain
 (quadri-
valent

 vaccine
 [QIV])
 when
 added
 to
 either
 high
 or
 low
doses
 of
 a

 Methods
This
 multicenter,
 randomized,
 observer-blind,
 dose-ranging,
factorial
 design,
 clinical
 trial
 in
 healthy
 children
 aged
 6
 to
 <36
months
 was
 performed
 in
 10
 study
 centers
 in
 Finland
 and
 5
 centers
in
 Belgium.
 Data
 were
 collected
 between
 October
 2008
 and
 March
2009.
 The
 study
 was
 undertaken
 in
 compliance
 with
 Good
 Clinical
Practice
 guidelines
 and
 the
 Declaration
 of
 Helsinki,
 and
 the
 study
protocol
 was
 approved
 by
 the
 National
 Ethics
 Committee
 of
 Finland
and
 the
 individual
 ethics
 review
 committees
 of
 participating
 cen-
ters
 in
 Belgium.
 Before
 enrollment,
 written
 informed
 consent
 was
obtained
 from
 parents
 or
 legal
 guardians.
2.1.
 Objectives
Immunogenicity
 objectives
 of
 this
 study
 were
 (i)
 to
 evalu-
ate
 whether
 a
 one-dose
 schedule
 of
 any
 formulation
 provides
a
 similar
 immunogenicity
 to
 a
 two-dose
 schedule
 (two
 0.25-mL
vaccinations
 of
 adjuvanted
 [7.5
 g
 TIV/QIV
 +
 50%
 MF59]
 (ATIV)
and
 nonadjuvanted
 [7.5
 g
 TIV/QIV
 +
 0%
 MF59]
 TIV
 formulations);
(ii)
 to
 evaluate
 the
 immunogenicity
 of
 the
 study
 vaccine
 for-
mulations
 according
 to
 the
 European
 Medicines
 Agency
 (EMEA)
recommendations
 (CPMP/BWP/214/96);
 (iii)
 to
 determine
 whether
the
 addition
 of
 a
 second
 inﬂuenza
 B
 strain
 to
 a
 TIV
 is
 immuno-
genic
 against
 the
 second
 B
 strain
 and
 whether
 it
 affects
 the
 immune
response
 against
 the
 ﬁrst
 inﬂuenza
 B
 strain
 or
 the
 A/H3N2
 and
A/H1N1
 strains;
 (iv)
 to
 assess
 the
 dose–response
 relationship
between
 the
 MF59
 dose
 and
 strain-speciﬁc
 antibodies;
 (v)
 to
 com-
pare
 the
 study
 vaccine
 formulations
 to
 an
 approved
 nonadjuvanted
pediatric
 TIV
 (Vaxigrip®, Sanoﬁ
 Pasteur)
 and
 to
 the
 vaccine
 formu-
lated
 with
 7.5
 g
 per
 antigen
 and
 50%
 of
 the
 approved
 MF59
 dose
 in
elderly
 adults
 (ATIV).
 Safety
 and
 tolerability
 objectives
 were
 to
 eval-
uate
 solicited
 local
 and
 systemic
 reactogenicity
 and
 spontaneously
reported
 adverse
 events
 (AEs)
 and
 serious
 AEs
 (SAEs).
2.2.
 Subjects
A
 total
 of
 595
 healthy
 subjects
 of
 6
 to
 <36
 months
 of
 age
 were
planned
 to
 be
 enrolled
 in
 this
 study.
 Ultimately,
 410
 subjects
 were
randomized
 owing
 to
 the
 slower
 than
 expected
 recruitment,
 which
was
 stopped
 close
 to
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 inﬂuenza
 season.
 The
 main
exclusion
 criteria
 were
 any
 history
 or
 ongoing
 chronic
 illness
 likely
to
 interfere
 with
 the
 results;
 any
 history
 or
 likelihood
 of
 anaphy-
laxis
 or
 adverse
 reactions
 to
 vaccine
 components;
 any
 known
 or
suspected
 impairment/alteration
 of
 the
 immune
 system
 (including
use
 of
 immunosuppressive
 therapy,
 receipt
 of
 immunostimulants,
blood,
 blood
 products,
 and/or
 plasma
 derivatives
 or
 any
 parenteral
immunoglobulin
 preparation
 in
 the
 past
 12
 weeks
 before
 enroll-
ment);
 and
 any
 history
 of
 progressive
 or
 severe
 neurologic
 disorder,
nonfebrile
 seizures,
 clinically
 suspected
 development
 delay,
 or
bleeding
 diathesis.
 Additional
 exclusion
 criteria
 were
 receipt
 of
 any
other
 vaccine
 within
 2
 weeks
 (inactivated
 vaccines)
 or
 4
 weeks
 (live
vaccines)
 before
 enrollment,
 of
 inﬂuenza

 within
 90
 days
 of
 enrollment,
 rectal
temperature
 ≥38.5 ◦C,
 and/or
 any
 acute
 illness
 within
 3
 days
 before

 visit,
 unwillingness
 to
 refuse
 participation
 in
 another
clinical
 trial
 before
 study
 completion,
 or
 a
 surgery
 planned
 during
the
 study
 period
 that
 would
 interfere
 with
 the
 study

 All
 participating
 children
 were
 to
be
 followed
 up
 through
 Day
 29
 (study
 groups
 O
 and
 P)
 or
 Day
 50
(study
 groups
 A–N
 and

 Subjects
 in
 groups
 A–N
 and
 Q
 were
 to
receive
 two
 doses
 of
 the
 assigned
 study
 vaccine
 4
 weeks
 apart,
 on
Days
 1
 and
 29,
 whereas
 participants
 in
 study
 groups
 O
 and
 P with
full-dose
 MF59
 adjuvant
 were
 to
 receive
 one
 vaccination
 on
 Day
 1
only.
 Vaccines
 were
 to
 be
 administered
 intramuscularly,
 preferably
in
 the
 deltoid
 muscle
 of
 the
 nondominant
 arm
 (children
 24–35
 mo
of
 age)
 or
 the
 anterolateral
 aspect
 of
 the
 thigh
 (children
 <24
 mo
 of
age).
 Time
 points
 for
 immunogenicity
 assessments
 were
 on
 Day
 1
(prevaccination),
 Day
 29
 (4
 wk  after
 dose
 1),
 and
 Day
 50
 (3
 wk
 after

 card
 for
 7
 consecutive
 days
 following
 the
 ﬁrst
 and
 second
vaccinations.
 All
 reports
 of
 spontaneous
 AEs
 and
 concomitant

 (A/H3N2)-like
 virus,
 and
 inﬂuenza
B/Florida/4/2006-like

 (of
 the
 inﬂuenza
 B/Yamagata
 lineage).
Inﬂuenza
 B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like
 antigen
 virus
 (Victoria
 lin-

 was
 selected
 as
 the
 second
 B
 strain
 at
 7.5mcg
 or

dose.
 The
 MF59
 adjuvant
 is
 an
 oil-in-water
 emulsion,
 ﬁrst
 licensed
for
 use
 in
 seasonal
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 in
 1997
 and
 of
 which
 more
than
 50
 million
 doses
 have
 been
 delivered
 in
 Europe.
 At
 the
 time
of
 this
 publication,
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 including
 MF59
 adjuvant
have
 been
 administered
 to
 over
 4100
 children
 in
 clinical
 studies
(Novartis
 Vaccines
 and
 Diagnostics,
 data
 on
 ﬁle).
 In
 these
 studies,
the
 safety
 proﬁle
 of
 the
 adjuvanted
 vaccine
 was
 similar
 to
 one
 of
the
 nonadjuvanted
 comparator
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 [21–23],
 except
for
 increases
 in
 mostly
 mild
 and
 local
 reactogenicity.
 A

 of
 the
 adjuvant
 MF59,
 as
 used
 in
 one
 0.5-mL

 Safety
 and
 tolerability
 assessment
Solicited
 local
 reactions
 reported
 via
 diary
 card
 included
 ecchy-
mosis,
 erythema,
 induration,
 swelling,
 and
 tenderness
 at
 injection
site;
 solicited
 systemic
 reactions
 included
 sleepiness,
 diarrhea,
vomiting,
 irritability,
 change
 in
 eating
 habits,
 shivering,
 and
unusual
 crying.
 Other
 indicators
 of
 reactogenicity
 were
 body
 tem-
perature
 (preferably
 rectal
 temperature
 measurement)
 and
 use
 of
analgesics/antipyretic
 medication
 for
 vaccination-induced
 fever.
Local
 and
 systemic
 reactions
 were
 graded
 for
 severity
 according
to
 standardized
 scales,
 following
 the
 Center
 for
 Biologics
 Evalua-
tion
 and
 Research
 (CBER)
 Guidance
 [25,26]. The
 severity
 of
 adverse
reactions
 was
 categorized
 as
 none,
 mild
 (grade
 1),
 moderate
 (grade
2),
 severe
 (grade
 3),
 or
 potentially
 life
 threatening
 (grade
 4).

 Statistical
 analyses
2.7.1.
 Sample
 size
Assuming
 log-normal
 distributed
 antibody
 titer,
 a
 minimum
relevant
 difference
 of
 factor
 2.5,
 a
 common
 standard
 deviation
 of
0.45
 for
 the
 log10 titer,
 a
 1-sided
 experiment-wise
 error
 of
 5%,
 an
80%
 any-pair
 power,
 and
 a
 9%
 dropout
 rate
 resulted
 in
 a
 total
 of
595
 subjects
 (n
 =
 35
 in
 each
 study
 group)
 [27].
 As
 groups
 could
 be
combined,
 detectable
 minimum
 relevant
 differences
 (80%
 marginal
power;
 2-sided
 alpha
 5%)
 ranged
 between
 1.64
 (n
 =
 70/group)
 and
1.80
 (n
 =
 70/group)
 when
 using
 t
 tests
 and
 the
 same
 assumptions
as
 above.
 Population
 characteristics
 were
 summarized
 per
 vaccine
group.
2.7.2.
 Immunogenicity
 analyses
Immunogenicity
 analyses
 were
 run
 on
 the
 per-protocol
 set
(PPS),
 whereas
 safety
 was
 analyzed
 for
 all
 subjects
 exposed.
Log10-transformed
 antibody
 titers
 were
 modeled
 using
 analysis
 of
covariance
 (ANCOVA)
 for
 each
 strain
 and
 time
 point
 separately.
Vaccine
 groups
 were
 included
 as
 qualitative
 factor,
 and
 strain-
speciﬁc
 prevaccination
 titers
 served
 as
 covariate.
 Point
 estimates
(geometric
 means,
 ratio
 of
 geometric
 means),
 their
 2-sided
 95%
conﬁdence
 intervals,
 and
 p
 values
 for
 testing
 noninferiority
 and
superiority
 hypotheses
 were
 derived
 from
 the
 models.
 Nonin-
feriority
 and
 superiority
 margins
 of
 0.67
 and
 1.00,
 respectively,
were
 prespeciﬁed,
 and
 signiﬁcance
 was
 declared
 if
 the
 1-sided
 p
value
 was
 below
 0.025.
 For
 the
 analysis
 of
 differences,
 a
 2-sided

 /
 Vaccine
 29 (2011) 8696–

p
 value
 less
 than
 0.05
 was
 required.
 Immunogenicity
 data
 were
also
 analyzed
 based
 on
 HI
 licensure
 criteria
 according
 to
 EMEA
 rec-
ommendations
 (CPMP/BWP/214/96)
 [28]. There
 are
 no
 criteria
 for
immunogenicity
 in
 children
 established
 by
 EMEA;
 the
 closest
 stan-
dards
 are
 those
 used
 for
 an
 adult
 population.
 For
 the
 analyses
 of
 the
TIV
 strains,
 vaccine
 groups
 were
 combined
 (pooled
 by
 MF59
 doses
and
 across
 identical
 TIV
 antigen
 levels)
 after
 having
 demonstrated
that
 the
 second
 B
 strain
 had
 no
 impact
 on
 the
 antibody
 response
of
 the
 TIV
 strains.
 A
 similar
 pooling
 was
 done
 for
 the
 analysis
 of
the
 second
 B
 strain
 as
 the
 TIV
 antigen
 levels
 had
 no
 impact
 on
 the
antibody
 response
 to
 the
 second
 B
 strain.
 The
 dose–response
 rela-
tionship
 was
 modeled
 using
 two
 approaches:
 (1)
 linear
 regression
analysis
 with
 log10-transformed
 titer
 as
 dependent
 and
 MF59
 dose
as
 independent
 quantitative
 variable
 and
 by
 means
 of
 a
 (2)
 prevac-
cination
 titer
 adjusted
 ANCOVA
 with
 3
 pooled
 vaccine
 groups,
 each
consisting
 of
 both
 TIV
 and
 both
 QIV
 formulations,
 for
 0%,
 25%,
 and
50%
 MF59
 doses.
 MF59
 doses
 of
 12.5%
 and
 100%
 could
 not
 be
 used
because
 they
 were
 either
 employed
 in
 only
 one
 TIV
 and
 one
 QIV
formulation
 or
 only
 one
 vaccination
 was
 given.
2.7.3.
 Safety
 and
 tolerability
 analyses
Safety
 and

 data
 were
 summarized
 by

providing
 the

 Results
3.1.
 study
 subjects
A total
 of
 410
 healthy
 children
 6
 to
 <36
 months
 old
 were
 enrolled
in
 the
 study.
 All
 subjects
 were
 vaccinated:
 395
 (96%)
 subjects
were
 included
 for
 immunogenicity
 analyses
 (PPS)
 at
 baseline,
 322
(79%)
 subjects
 were
 included
 at
 Day
 29,
 and
 282
 (77.9%
 of
 enrolled
subjects
 that
 were
 to
 receive
 second
 vaccination)
 subjects
 were
included
 at
 Day
 50.
 All
 subjects
 were
 evaluated
 for
 safety.
 Sub-
jects
 were
 predominantly
 white,
 mean
 age
 ranged
 from
 14.2
 to
20
 months
 across
 study
 groups,
 and
 boys
 and
 girls
 were
 evenly
distributed
 in
 most
 groups
 (Table
 2).
 There
 were
 no
 noteworthy
 dif-
ferences
 in
 weight
 and
 height.
 A
 total
 of
 11
 children
 (2.7%
 of
 overall
population)
 had
 previously
 received
 an
 inﬂuenza
 vaccination,
 and
all
 participants
 met
 the
 entry
 criteria.
3.2.
 Immunogenicity
Prevaccination,
 there
 were
 low
 levels
 of
 antibodies
 against
 the
four
 vaccine
 strains
 in
 the
 395
 subjects
 tested,
 with
 14.7%,
 10.6%,
10.4%
 and
 1.0%
 having
 titers
 ≥10
 against
 the
 H1N1,
 H3N2,
 B
 Florida
and
 B
 Malaysia
 strains,
 respectively.
(i)
 In
 the
 assessment
 of
 whether
 a
 one-dose
 schedule
 of
 any
 for-
mulation
 provides
 similar
 immunogenicity
 to
 two
 0.25-mL
vaccinations
 of
 adjuvanted
 (7.5
 g
 TIV/QIV
 +
 50%
 MF59)
 or
 non-
adjuvanted
 (7.5
 g
 TIV/QIV)
 formulations,
 it
 was
 found
 that
 no
formulation
 was
 noninferior
 after
 one
 vaccination
 compared
with
 two
 vaccinations
 of
 the
 adjuvanted
 comparator
 (7.5
 g
TIV/QIV
 +
 50%
 MF59).
 Vice
 versa,
 all
 adjuvanted
 formulations
were
 noninferior
 after
 one
 vaccination
 compared
 with
 two
 vac-
cinations
 of
 the
 nonadjuvanted
 comparator
 (7.5
 g
 TIV/QIV)
for
 the
 H1N1
 and
 H3N2
 strains.
 For
 the
 ﬁrst
 B
 strain,
 only
 the
adjuvanted
 formulations
 with
 either
 50%
 or
 100%
 MF59
 were
noninferior
 after
 one
 vaccination,
 and
 for
 the
 second
 B
 strain,
only
 15
 g
 +
 100%
 MF59
 were
 noninferior
 after
 one
 vaccination
compared
 with
 two
 vaccinations
 of
 the
 nonadjuvanted
 com-
parator
 (7.5
 g
 TIV/QIV).
(ii) Evaluation
 of
 GMRs,
 seroprotection,
 and
 seroconversion
 rates
according
 to
 Committee
 for

(CHMP)
 criteria
 across
 vaccine
 groups
 and
 virus
 strains
 are
 pre-
sented
 in
 Table
 3
 (A/H1N1,
 A/H3N2,
 ﬁrst
 B
 strain,
 second
 B
strain).
 On
 Day
 29,
 4
 weeks
 after
 the
 ﬁrst
 vaccination,
 strong
immune
 responses
 for
 the
 A
 strains
 were
 evident
 for
 the
 adju-
vanted
 formulations,
 and
 all
 three
 CHMP
 criteria
 were
 met
 for
all
 the
 adjuvanted
 vaccine
 groups.
 For
 the
 ﬁrst
 B
 strain
 (Florida),
only
 15
 g
 TIV/QIV
 formulated
 with
 a
 half
 or
 full
 MF59
 dose
 met
any
 of
 the
 criteria
 (GMR)
 after
 the
 ﬁrst
 vaccination.
 After
 two
vaccinations,
 all
 three
 CHMP
 criteria
 were
 met
 for
 the
 three
 TIV
strains
 by
 all
 adjuvanted
 formulations.
 None
 of
 the
 nonadju-
vanted
 formulations
 –
 7.5
 and
 15
 g
 TIV/QIV
 or
 the
 licensed
pediatric
 comparator
 Vaxigrip
 (7.5
 g
 TIV)
 –
 met
 all
 CHMP
 cri-
teria
 after
 either
 ﬁrst
 or
 second
 vaccination.
 For
 the
 second
 B
strain
 (Malaysia),
 after
 one
 vaccination
 none
 of
 the
 QIV
 formu-
lations
 met
 any
 CHMP
 criterion;
 after
 the
 second
 vaccination,
all
 adjuvanted
 QIV
 formulations
 met
 all
 CHMP
 criteria,
 whereas
none
 of
 the
 nonadjuvanted
 QIV
 formulation
 met
 any
 CHMP
criterion.
(iii)
 As
 expected,
 antibody
 responses
 to
 the
 second
 inﬂuenza
 B
strains
 were
 greater
 in
 children
 who
 were
 vaccinated
 with
QIV
 rather
 than
 TIV
 strains.
 The
 addition
 of
 the
 B/Malaysia
strain
 to
 TIV
 did
 not
 signiﬁcantly
 impact
 (p
 >
 0.05
 for
 all
 strains
and
 visits)
 the
 antibody
 responses
 against
 A/H1N1,
 A/H3N2,
 or
B/Florida
 strains.
 GMT
 ratios
 of
 pooled
 QIV
 to
 pooled
 TIV
 anti-
gen
 groups
 for
 Day
 29
 and
 Day
 50
 were
 in
 the
 following
 ranges:
0.99–1.23
 for
 A/H1N1,
 0.71–0.83
 for
 A/H3N2,
 and
 0.85–1.07
 for
B/Florida.
(iv)
 Linear
 regression
 analyses
 showed
 signiﬁcant
 increases
 in
 anti-
body
 response
 with
 increasing
 MF59
 dose
 for
 all
 four
 inﬂuenza
strains.
 The
 slopes
 and
 corresponding
 CI
 for
 lower
 (7.5
 g)
 and
higher
 (15
 g)
 antigen
 doses
 are
 speciﬁed
 in
 terms
 of
 factors.
Increasing
 the
 MF59
 content
 from
 0%
 to
 100%
 translates
 for
lower
 (7.5
 g)
 and
 higher
 (15
 g)
 antigen
 dose,
 respectively,
into
 an
 increase
 in
 antibody
 titer
 (95%
 CI)
 of
 33.1
 (9.3–117.5)
and
 117.5
 (38–363.1)
 for
 A/H1N1,
 30.2
 (9.3–97.7),
 and
 93.3
(32.4–269.2)
 for
 H3N2,
 20.4
 (8.1–52.5),
 and
 91.2
 (37–229.1)
for
 ﬁrst
 B
 strain,
 and
 26.9
 (6.8–114.8)
 and
 52.5
 (14.8–186.2)
for
 second
 B
 strain,
 respectively.
 The
 slopes
 measured
 at
 the
higher
 antigen
 dose
 were
 consistently
 greater
 than
 those
 mea-
sured
 at
 the
 lower
 antigen
 dose,
 suggesting
 that
 increasing
antigen
 dose
 in
 combination
 with
 increasing
 MF59
 dose
 is
associated
 with
 higher
 antibody
 responses
 to
 these
 inﬂuenza
strains.
All
 low-and
 high-antigen
 dose
 levels
 for
 0%,
 25%,
 and
 50%
MF59
 doses
 were
 pooled
 to
 increase
 sample
 size.
 Pooling
 anal-
yses
 could
 not
 be
 performed
 for
 the
 remaining
 two
 MF59
 doses,
12.5%
 and
 100%,
 because
 these
 had
 either
 only
 low
 or
 only
high
 antigen
 dose.
 Substantially
 increased
 GMTs
 are
 evident
for
 pooled
 25%
 MF59
 dose
 groups
 compared
 with
 nonadju-
vanted
 pooled
 groups,
 as
 shown
 by
 a
 5-
 to
 7-fold
 increase
 in
GMTs
 at
 Day
 50
 for
 all
 virus
 strains
 (Fig.
 1A–D).
 When
 com-
paring
 the
 pooled
 group
 with
 25%
 MF59
 doses
 with
 the
 pooled
group
 with
 50%
 MF59
 dose,
 GMTs
 at
 Day
 29
 show
 additional
increases
 of
 approximately
 28%
 for
 A/H1N1,
 29%
 for
 A/H3N2,
24%
 for
 B/Florida,
 and
 8%
 for
 B/Malaysia,
 and
 at
 Day
 50,
 GMTs
show
 additional
 increases
 of
 approximately
 23%
 for
 H1N1,
 13%
for
 H3N2,
 36%
 for
 B\Florida,
 and
 9%
 for
 B\Malaysia
 (Fig.
 1A–D).
(v)
 All
 MF59-adjuvanted
 formulations
 but
 none
 of
 the
 nonad-
juvanted
 formulations
 induced
 superior
 antibody
 responses
after
 the
 second
 vaccination
 against
 all
 virus
 strains
 compared
with
 the
 pediatric
 nonadjuvanted

 None
 of
 the

 against
 any
 of
 the

 Discussion
Previous
 reports
 have
 shown
 that
 unprimed
 young
 children
respond
 suboptimally
 to
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines.
 Indeed,
 a
 recent
Cochrane
 analysis
 implies
 that
 conventional
 TIVs
 have
 limited
 efﬁ-
cacy
 in
 young
 children
 and
 toddlers
 [7],  who
 are
 at
 higher
 risk
 for
inﬂuenza-related
 complications
 [1].  Vaccine
 efﬁcacy
 may
 be
 even
further
 compromised
 when
 there
 is
 a
 mismatch
 between
 the
 virus
strains
 included
 in
 the
 vaccine
 and
 the
 actual
 strains
 in
 circula-
tion
 [29].
 Since
 the
 early
 1980s,
 two
 distinct
 lineages
 of
 B
 inﬂuenza
strains
 have
 often
 cocirculated
 in
 humans,
 and
 there
 is
 no
 cross-
protection
 between
 these
 lineages.
 Adding
 an
 additional
 B
 strain
 to
the
 traditional
 TIV
 is
 expected
 to
 signiﬁcantly
 broaden
 the
 cover-
age
 of
 the
 vaccine,
 while
 adding
 an
 adjuvant
 such
 as
 MF59
 has
 been
shown
 to
 enhance
 the
 immune
 responses
 in
 general
 and
 broaden
it
 to
 cover
 heterologous
 strains
 [30–32].
In  this
 study
 we
 found
 that
 the
 addition
 of
 the
 second
 B
strain
 improved
 immunologic
 response
 to
 the
 matched
 antigen
and
 did
 not
 negatively
 affect
 immunogenicity
 of
 the
 other
 virus
strains.
 Furthermore,
 the
 MF59-adjuvanted
 vaccine
 formulations
induced
 superior
 antibody
 responses
 compared
 with
 nonadju-
vanted
 comparators
 for
 all
 virus
 strains.
 Both
 7.5-g
 and
 15-g
MF59-adjuvanted
 formulations
 met
 all
 three
 EU
 CHMP
 licensure
criteria
 speciﬁed
 for
 adults
 after
 the
 ﬁrst
 vaccination
 for
 A/H1N1
and
 A/H3N2
 strains
 and
 after
 the
 second
 vaccination
 for
 the
 two
B
 strains.
 In
 contrast,
 none
 of
 the
 nonadjuvanted
 vaccine
 formula-
tions
 –
 7.5
 and
 15
 g
 TIV/QIV
 or
 the
 licensed
 pediatric
 comparator
Vaxigrip
 (7.5

 –
 met

 licensure
 after
 the
 ﬁrst
or
 second
 vaccinations
 in
 this
 population
 of
 children
 aged
 6
 to
 <36
months
 in
 this
 study.
 Further,
 results
 show
 that
 a
 single
 vaccination
of
 MF59-adjuvanted
 vaccine
 might
 induce
 generally
 high
 antibody
responses
 to
 inﬂuenza
 A
 strains,
 which
 may
 have
 important
 clinical
implications,
 for
 example,
 in
 case
 of
 vaccination
 late
 in
 the
 inﬂuenza
season
 or

Adjuvants
 have
 been
 developed
 to
 improve
 the
 performance
 of
vaccines,
 and
 MF59,
 an
 oil-in-water
 emulsion
 containing
 naturally
occurring
 squalene,
 has
 been
 approved
 for
 human
 use
 since
 1997
as
 an
 inﬂuenza
 subunit
 vaccine
 adjuvant
 for
 elderly
 adults
 [23].
Previous
 clinical
 studies
 have
 demonstrated
 that
 MF59-adjuvanted
inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 induced
 higher
 and
 broader
 antibody
 responses
than
 nonadjuvanted
 vaccines,
 especially
 in
 subjects
 with
 low
 pre-
vaccination
 antibody
 titers,
 in
 vulnerable
 populations
 including
the
 elderly
 and
 those
 with
 underlying
 chronic
 conditions,
 and,
most
 recently,
 in
 young
 children
 [8,22,33–35]. We  observed
 a
dose–response
 trend
 for
 immunogenicity
 with
 increasing
 MF59
dose
 for
 all
 inﬂuenza
 stains.
 GMTs
 at
 Day
 29
 and
 Day
 50
 for
 pooled
MF59
 dose
 groups
 (7.5
 and
 15
 g
 antigens
 combined)
 showed
additional
 increases
 of
 28%
 and
 23%
 for
 A/H1N1,
 29%
 and
 13%
 for
A/H3N2,
 24%
 and
 36%
 for
 B/Florida,
 and
 8%
 and
 9%
 for
 B/Malaysia,
respectively,
 for
 the
 pooled
 group
 with
 50%
 over
 the
 one
 with
25%
 of
 the
 adult
 MF59
 dose
 group.
 Also,
 results
 from
 regression
analyses
 suggest
 that
 increasing
 antigen
 dose
 (15
 g
 vs
 0
 and
7.5
 g)
 in
 combination
 with
 increasing
 MF59
 dose
 was
 associ-
ated
 with
 higher
 antibody
 responses
 for
 A/H1N1,
 A/H3N2,
 and
 ﬁrst
B
 strains.
The
 overall
 safety
 and
 tolerability
 proﬁles
 were
 as
 expected
in
 this
 age
 group
 and
 were
 in
 line
 with
 previous
 studies
 using
MF59-adjuvanted
 vaccines
 in
 young
 children
 [8,34].
 There
 was
no
 tendency
 for
 an
 increase
 in
 local
 or
 systemic
 solicited
 reac-
tions
 nor
 in
 unsolicited
 AEs
 with
 increasing
 MF59
 content
 in
 terms
of
 either
 frequency
 or
 severity.
 However,
 the
 reactogenicity
 and
safety
 proﬁle
 of
 the
 full
 MF59
 dose
 level
 could
 not
 be
 adequately
assessed
 because
 only
 one
 vaccination
 was
 given
 in
 the
 corre-
sponding
 groups
 and
 because
 of
 limited
 experience
 with
 high
 MF59
doses
 in
 young
 children.
 Reactogenicity
 of
 the
 7.5-g
 TIV/QIV
 for-
mulations
 was
 slightly
 lower
 than
 for
 the
 corresponding
 15-g
formulations,
 but
 inclusion
 of
 the
 second
 B
 strain
 did
 not
 appear
 to
affect
 reactogenicity.
 Altogether,
 the
 safety
 results
 did
 not
 reveal
an
 increased
 risk
 associated
 with
 MF59
 dose,
 antigen
 dose,
 or
 the
addition
 of
 a
 second
 B
 strain.
In
 conclusion,
 this
 study
 conﬁrms
 that
 the
 immunogenicity
 of
nonadjuvanted
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 is
 suboptimal
 in
 young
 children
and
 indicates
 that
• Addition
 of
 MF59
 adjuvant
 promotes
 HI
 antibody
 responses
 to
levels
 associated
 with
 protection
 in
 adults
 to
 an
 extent
 not
achieved
 by
 nonadjuvanted
 vaccines
 and
 with
 no
 impact
 on
 reac-
togenicity
 and
 safety
 in
 these
 young
 children
• While
 the
 combination
 of
 the
 7.5-g
 antigen
 and
 50%
 MF59
appears
 to
 offer
 the
 best
 balance
 between
 signiﬁcantly
 improved
immunogenicity
 and
 good
 tolerability,
 the
 incremental
 increase
over
 25%
 MF59
 was
 relatively
 small,
 and
 this
 dose
 may
 be
 consid-
ered
 if
 future
 experience
 raises
 any
 concerns
 over
 reactogenicity
• A
 second
 inﬂuenza
 B
 strain
 combined
 with
 the
 traditional
 TIV
vaccine
 is
 immunogenic
 and
 does
 not
 affect
 immunogenicity
 of
the
 other
 three
 inﬂuenza
 strains
• The
 MF59-adjuvanted
 TIV
 and
 QIV
 vaccines
 already
 show
 a
 mean-
ingful
 immune
 response
 to
 inﬂuenza
 A
 strains
 after
 one
 dose,
which
 may
 be
 beneﬁcial
 in
 real-life
 clinical
 practice
 where
 a
 sec-
ond
 dose
 is
 often
 missed,
 but
 the
 two-dose
 vaccination
 schedule
must
 continue
 to
 be
 recommended
 in
 young
 children
 to
 provide
protection
 against
 inﬂuenza
 B
 strains.
Further
 studies
 of
 quadrivalent
 and
 MF59-adjuvanted
 inﬂuenza
vaccines
 in
 young
 children,
 including
 efﬁcacy
 trials,
 are
 warranted.
