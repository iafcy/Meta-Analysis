After priming with two intramuscular doses of MF59®-adjuvanted (Sub/MF59) or split inﬂuenza vac-
cines during the 2006/07 season, 89 healthy children received a third booster dose of the respective
vaccine (2007/08 Northern Hemisphere formulation) approximately 1 year later, and were followed up
for 6 months post-third injection. Immunogenicity was evaluated on 81 of them by a hemagglutination
inhibition (HI) assay before and 3 weeks after vaccination.
The Sub/MF59 inﬂuenza vaccine was safe and well tolerated following the booster vaccination. Pre-
booster HI antibody titers were consistently higher in the Sub/MF59 group than in the comparator group,
conﬁrming signiﬁcantly longer persistence of antibodies after priming with Sub/MF59 vaccine. Post-
booster immune responses were signiﬁcantly higher in the Sub/MF59 group compared with the split
group, especially vs. the inﬂuenza B strain, which is epidemiologically relevant in the pediatric population.
Altogether, these data further support the potential use of MF59®-adjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccine as a safe
and highly immunogenic inﬂuenza vaccine for young children.

1. Introduction
Although recent epidemiologic observations suggesting that
children have the highest attack rates of inﬂuenza [1,2], and that
very young children are at substantially increased risk for inﬂuenza-
related hospitalizations [3], seasonal vaccination of children is
currently only recommended in six European countries [4]. The
limited immunogenicity, efﬁcacy and effectiveness of the currently
available trivalent inactivated inﬂuenza vaccines (TIVs) in young
children may have played a signiﬁcant role in the slow and skepti-
cal implementation of universal immunization strategy in Europe
[5].
Improved immune responses to seasonal inﬂuenza vaccines
have been shown with the use of MF59® as adjuvant with inﬂuenza
vaccine [6]. A proof of concept, randomized, observer-blind study,
performed in Finland during 2006/07 NH season, showed that
unprimed children under 3 years of age displayed higher immune
responses to the MF59®-adjuvanted vaccine compared with a
conventional non-adjuvanted split vaccine. Higher seroprotection
rates vs. the A/H3N2 vaccine strain were already obtained after
the ﬁrst vaccination. In addition, signiﬁcantly higher percentages

of children were seroprotected against the B vaccine strain and
statistically signiﬁcantly longer persistence of hemagglutination
inhibition (HI) antibody titers was demonstrated in children receiv-
ing the adjuvanted vaccine, compared with the conventional TIV
[7].
The aim of this study was to compare in healthy children from
the original study, the clinical tolerability, safety and immunogenic-
ity of a third consecutive dose of the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine,
compared with the split TIV, administered approximately 1 year
after priming.
2. Materials and methods
This observer-blind study was conducted in Finland. Parents
of children who were primed with a MF59-adjuvanted (FLUAD®,
Novartis Vaccines; Sub/MF59) or a split vaccine (Vaxigrip®, Sanoﬁ
Pasteur) in the proof of concept study (Northern Hemisphere [NH]
season 2006/07), were invited to allow their children to participate
in this extension study, designed to evaluate responses to a third
dose of the respective vaccines, formulated for the NH 2007/08
campaign. The subjects were children from 16 to <48 months of age,
in good health as determined by medical history, physical exam-
ination and clinical judgment of the investigator, whose parents
had given written informed consent prior to study entry. The study
was performed according to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Dec-
laration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice, and local laws. Before

the trial started, the study protocol and informed consent form
were approved by the ethical committee of the Pirkanmaa Hospital
District, Finland.
After obtaining informed consent from parents/legal guardians,
children received a single intramuscular (IM) dose of 0.25 mL (chil-
dren < 3 years) or 0.5 mL (≥3 years of age) of the corresponding
vaccine. Each 0.5 mL dose contained 15 g of hemagglutinin of each
of the three vaccine strains [A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1)-like,
A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2)-like virus, B/Malaysia/2506/2004-
like virus].
For the 2007/08 NH season, the only change in the vaccine for-
mulation form the previous campaign was the A/H1N1-like strain
(A/Solomon Islands/3/2006). The third dose of the vaccines was like
a “booster dose” for the two strains, A/H3N2 and B, which did not
change across the two consecutive seasons.
2.1. Assessment of vaccine clinical tolerability and safety
Parents were instructed to record solicited local and systemic
reactions on a diary card immediately after vaccination and for the
following 7 days. Solicited local reactions were ecchymosis, ery-
thema, induration, swelling, and tenderness (children < 3 years) or
injection site pain (children ≥3 years). Solicited systemic reactions
were sleepiness, diarrhea, vomiting, irritability, change in eating
habits, shivering, unusual crying, fever for children <3 years of
age; chills, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, fatigue, fever
for children ≥3 years of age. Fever (deﬁned as an axillary temper-
ature ≥38 ◦C), usage of analgesic/antipyretic medication and any
other adverse event (AE) were also recorded on the diary cards
during the 7 days following each vaccination.
All AEs including serious adverse events (SAEs) and those
necessitating a physician’s consultation, or leading to premature
study discontinuation were collected throughout the entire trial (6
months).
2.2. Assessment of vaccine immunogenicity
Blood samples (5 mL) were obtained immediately prior to (day
1) and 3 weeks (day 22) after vaccination. Sera were stored at −20 ◦C
until laboratory determination of HI antibody titers against the vac-
cine strains, as described previously [8].
The study parameters considered for humoral immune response
for each strain were: the Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) of HI anti-
bodies with 95% conﬁdence interval (CI); the Geometric Mean
Ratio (GMR, ratio of post- to pre-vaccination titers) with 95%
CI; the seroprotection rate, deﬁned as the percentage of children
achieving an HI titer ≥40; and the seroconversion rate, deﬁned
as the percentage of children achieving either seroconversion
(i.e., a post-vaccination HI titer ≥40 from a pre-vaccination HI
titer < 10) or signiﬁcant increase in HI titers (i.e., at least a 4-fold
rise in post-vaccination HI antibody titer from a pre-vaccination HI
titer ≥10).
2.3. Statistical analysis
Least squares GMTs and associated 95% CIs for each strain and
each vaccine group were determined using analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with one factor for vaccine group. Vaccine group dif-
ferences (post-vaccination ratio of GMTs between vaccines) were
assessed using the same approach. All analyses were performed on
the logarithmically (base 10) transformed titers.
The chi-square or Fisher’s Exact test were performed to ana-
lyze differences between proportions of subjects. The 95% CIs for
the difference between the two vaccines groups on percentages
of subjects achieving seroprotection and/or seroconversion were
calculated using the Clopper–Pearson method.
Data were analyzed using the SAS System (Cary, NC, USA). A
P-value of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical signiﬁcance.
3. Results
Overall, 89 children were enrolled, vaccinated and analyzed for
safety.
Demographic and other baseline characteristics were well
matched between Sub/MF59 (N = 43) and split (N = 46) groups. The
mean age and the percentage of females enrolled were similar
between the two vaccine groups (33.5 months vs. 33.9 months of
age and 44% vs. 46% of females, respectively, in the Sub/MF59 and
split group). All subjects were Caucasians.
Overall, 81 subjects were included in the per protocol popula-
tion (children who received the vaccine dose correctly and provided
valuable pre- and post-vaccination serum samples) for the analysis

of immunogenicity (41 in the Sub/MF59 group and 40 in the split
group).
3.1. Clinical tolerability and safety
Overall, solicited reactions were more frequently recorded in the
Sub/MF59 group, compared with the split group, in particular for
solicited local reactions (Table 1). The most commonly reported
local reactions in children <36 months were erythema and ten-
derness (32% Sub/MF59 and 30% split, for both reactions), while in
those aged 36 months and above were pain at the injection site (67%
and 26%, respectively), erythema and induration (28% Sub/MF59
and 22% split, for both reactions). The most frequent solicited sys-
temic reactions in young children were irritability (36% Sub/MF59
and 22% split) and diarrhea (24% Sub/MF59 and 13% split), while
in the older age group (≥36 months) the most common systemic
reactions were fatigue (28% Sub/MF59 and 35% split), chills and
headache (22% vs. 17% and 17% vs. 9%, respectively, in the Sub/MF59
and split groups). Fever was reported by 16% of younger children in
the Sub/MF59 and 9% of those in the split group; in children aged
3 years and above fever was recorded in 2 subjects in each vaccine
group.
The only statistically signiﬁcant difference between groups was
found for injection site pain in the older age cohort (≥3 years;
Sub/MF59 vs. split group, P < 0.01).
In both vaccine groups, solicited reactions were usually mild
or moderate in intensity and of short duration. Moreover, a
higher incidence of reactions in children aged ≥3 years, com-
pared with younger children, was evident for both vaccine groups
(Table 1).
Other adverse events, regardless of vaccine relatedness, col-
lected from day 1 to study termination (day 181), were reported by
70% (30/43) and 76% (35/46) of subjects in the Sub/MF59 and split
groups, respectively (Table 1). The most frequent AEs were otitis
media (30% in both groups), cough (21% Sub/MF59; 17% split), and
upper respiratory tract infection (19% Sub/MF59; 17% split); none
of these AEs was classiﬁed as severe.
Unsolicited AEs considered to be possibly or probably related to
vaccination occurred within the ﬁrst 21 days after vaccine injection,
were more frequent in the Sub/MF59 group, and were mostly local
or systemic reactions ongoing after the 7-day observational period,
known side effects of inﬂuenza vaccinations, or common illnesses
expected in this population (Table 1).
There were no SAEs or deaths during the study.
3.2. Immunogenicity results
Children primed during the previous inﬂuenza season with
Sub/MF59 vaccine showed higher pre-vaccination HI antibody
titers and higher seroprotection rates, compared with those vacci-

group—per protocol population.
nated with the conventional split TIV (Fig. 1), the difference was
statistically signiﬁcant against A/H3N2 antigen (P < 0.01 vs. split
group).
Three weeks after the booster vaccination, immune responses in
the Sub/MF59 group were signiﬁcantly higher than those observed
in the comparator group (P < 0.001, Sub/MF59 vs. split group; Fig. 1).
In the adjuvanted vaccine group, HI antibody titers were generally
higher in children <3 years of age than in the older ones, but within
the comparator group higher immune responses were induced in
children aged ≥3 years.
Seroprotection rates of 100% were achieved by both vac-
cines against both inﬂuenza A strains; however, only Sub/MF59
resulted in 100% seroprotection against inﬂuenza B, compared
with
68%
seroprotection
with
the
split
vaccine
(P < 0.001).
The

was
observed
for

(Table 2).
Seroprotection and seroconversion rates in children aged <3
years were generally similar to those in the older age group; lower
rates were only seen in the younger split vaccine group for the B
strain (P < 0.001, Sub/MF59 vs. split group for both seroprotection
and seroconversion rates).
4. Discussion
The beneﬁts of inﬂuenza vaccination in frail populations, such
as the elderly and adults with underlying chronic conditions, have
been established in previous studies leading to recommendations
for seasonal prophylaxis, whereas only limited data are available
on the beneﬁts in younger age groups [4].
Epidemiological studies have consistently shown high rates of
hospitalizations, as well as emergency room and out-patient vis-
its attributable to inﬂuenza disease among young children [9,10].
Based on such evidences, the US Advisory Committee on Immu-
nization Practices (ACIP) started recommending seasonal inﬂuenza
vaccination in very young children in 2004, expanding recommen-
dations to include all children aged 6–59 months in June 2006, and
further extending to all children and adolescents aged 5–18 years
in July 2008 [11,12].
The current European situation is quite different. Finland has
introduced routine immunization of 6–35 month-old children as
part of national immunization schedule, reaching 40% coverage in
2007 (unpublished Finnish National Public Health Institute [KTL]
survey). Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia and Slovenia recommend rou-
tine immunization of children (with the age limits varying from
6 months to 5 years of age) and Austria recommends inﬂuenza
vaccination for all age groups [4].
An inherent assumption of expanded vaccination recommenda-
tions is that currently available inﬂuenza vaccines are efﬁcacious
in preventing clinical inﬂuenza disease. Although studies have
documented immune responses following two doses of TIVs,
immunogenicity data, especially vs. the B inﬂuenza strain, are gen-
erally suboptimal and consequently vaccine efﬁcacy results remain
inconclusive, with a ﬁeld efﬁcacy and effectiveness estimated to be
limited in young children [5].
Adjuvants have been developed to improve the performance of
vaccines and MF59®, an oil-in-water emulsion containing the nat-
urally occurring squalene oil, has been approved for human use
in 1997 as an inﬂuenza subunit vaccine adjuvant for the elderly
[13]. MF59-adjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccine has been shown to pro-
vide higher and broader immunogenicity than non-adjuvanted
comparators, with a good tolerability and safety proﬁle in vulner-
able populations, such as the elderly and adults with underlying
chronic conditions, especially those with low pre-vaccination anti-
body titers [14–17].
In the original proof of concept observer-blind, randomized, con-
trolled study, performed in 269 unprimed children aged 6–<36
months, the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine was able to induce sig-
niﬁcantly higher immune responses compared with those of a
non-adjuvanted split vaccine (P < 0.001 for all three vaccine strains),
even in the youngest children (<24 months of age) and vs. the B
inﬂuenza strain, which epidemiologically is particularly relevant in
the pediatric community. Moreover the difference between the two
vaccines was sustained for 6 months over an inﬂuenza epidemic
season [7]. Sub/MF59 vaccine also induced signiﬁcantly higher
immune responses against mismatched A inﬂuenza strains, when
compared with conventional TIV (P < 0.001 against A/H3N2 strain
recommended for inclusion in the 2005/06 NH formulation and
against A/H1N1 included in the 2007/08 NH vaccine formulation).
Both vaccines were generally well tolerated and safe, with slightly
more mild and transient solicited reactions, especially injection site
swelling (P = 0.033 vs. split), in the Sub/MF59 group.
Following on from that clinical trial, the current study is the
ﬁrst investigation on the safety and immunogenicity of a third con-
secutive dose of a MF59-adjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccine or control
split vaccine, administered as a booster approximately 1 year after
two priming doses, in healthy children aged 16–<48 months. As in
the proof of concept study, both vaccines were generally well tol-
erated. There were slightly more mild and transient solicited local

T. Vesikari et al. / Vaccine 27 (2009) 6291–6295
6295
and systemic reactions reported in the Sub/MF59 group, but the
only statistically signiﬁcant difference was for injection site pain
for children ≥3 years of age (P < 0.01, Sub/MF59 vs. split group).
Moreover, irrespective of the vaccine group, a higher number of
solicited reactions was reported in children aged 3 years and above,
compared with younger children (<3 years).
Unsolicited AEs were consistently more common in the split vac-
cine group, while at least possibly or probably related AEs were
more frequent in the Sub/MF59 group, and were generally solicited
local or systemic reactions ongoing after the 7-day observation
period, known side effects of inﬂuenza vaccinations or common
illnesses expected in the pediatric population. No serious adverse
effects were reported during the study.
The children vaccinated during the previous inﬂuenza season
with Sub/MF59, showed higher pre-vaccination HI antibody titers
and seroprotection rates compared with those primed with split
vaccine, irrespective of the age stratum. This difference was great-
est against the A/H3N2 vaccine strain, with 36 of 41 children (88%)
having seroprotective titers at baseline in the Sub/MF59 group, and
16 of 40 (40%) in the split vaccine group (P < 0.001 vs. split vac-
cine).
Three weeks after booster vaccination, the MF59-adjuvanted
vaccine induced consistently higher HI antibody titers than the
split vaccine for all three inﬂuenza strains tested (P < 0.001 vs.
split group). This difference was most pronounced in the youngest
children (<3 years of age) and against the B inﬂuenza strain.
In the overall population, post-vaccination mean fold increases
in HI titers were higher in the Sub/MF59 group than in the
comparator vaccine group, with differences achieving a statis-
tical signiﬁcance against all three strains in the younger age
cohort.
Irrespective of the age cohort and the vaccine group, post-
vaccination seroprotection rates were achieved by all children
against A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 vaccine inﬂuenza strains. Sub/MF59
vaccine induced statistically signiﬁcant higher (P < 0.001) seropro-
tection and seroconversion rates against the B/Malaysia strain,
when compared with the non-adjuvanted split vaccine in the
overall population and in the youngest children (<3 years of
age).
The results of this extension study, performed to mimic the
ideal ﬁeld conditions of consecutive seasonal vaccinations, fur-
ther support the use of MF59®-adjuvanted subunit TIV as a highly
immunogenic and well-tolerated vaccine for active immunization
against seasonal inﬂuenza in healthy children.
