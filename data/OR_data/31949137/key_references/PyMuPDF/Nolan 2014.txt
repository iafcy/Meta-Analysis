Background:
 Non-adjuvanted
 seasonal
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 show  only  modest
 efﬁcacy
 in young  children.
This
 study  compared
 the  immunogenicity,
 reactogenicity
 and safety  of  the  MF59®-adjuvanted
 trivalent
subunit
 vaccine
 (aTIV)  with  two  non-adjuvanted
 trivalent
 vaccines,
 TIV-1,  the  non-adjuvanted
 version
of
 aTIV,  and  TIV-2,  a  split  virion  vaccine.
Methods:
 6078  children
 received
 two  doses  of  aTIV  (n = 3125),  TIV-1  (n =  1479),  or  TIV-2  (n = 1474)  four
weeks
 apart  (Days
 1 and
 29).  Children
 aged  6 to  <36  months
 and  36  to  <72  months
 received  0.25  mL  and
0.50
 mL doses,
 respectively.
 Immunogenicity
 was  assessed
 by  hemagglutination
 inhibition
 (HI)  assay
(n
 =  2435)  on  Days  1,  29,  50  and  209.  Safety
 was  assessed
 up  to  Day
 394.
Results:
 After  the second  vaccination
 (Day  50),  the  aTIV  group  showed
 signiﬁcantly
 higher  geometric
 mean
HI
 titers  and seroconversion
 rates  than  the  TIV-1  or  TIV-2
 groups
 against
 all  homologous
 and
 heterologous
strains.
 The
 difference
 was  enhanced
 at  HI  titers  ≥110.  aTIV  elicited  a faster,  more
 persistent
 antibody
response,
 with signiﬁcantly
 higher  titers  in  the aTIV  group  after  one
 vaccination
 (Day  29)  and  after
 six
months
 (Day  209)  than  in  either
 TIV  group.
 aTIV  was  more
 reactogenic
 than  were  TIV-1  and  TIV-2  but
rates
 of  severe
 adverse  events
 were very  low  for all  three  vaccines.
Conclusion:
 In infants
 and  young
 children,
 the MF59-adjuvanted
 vaccine
 induced  substantially
 faster
(after
 one  dose),
 higher,
 persistent
 HI  titers  than  the  non-adjuvanted
 vaccines,  with  consistently
 higher
seroprotection
 rates
 at  increased
 threshold
 HI  titers.

 Introduction
Inﬂuenza
 rates
 are
 highest
 in
 children,
 with
 young
 children,
especially
 those
 under
 two
 years
 old,
 constituting
 one
 of
 the
high-risk
 groups
 for
 infection
 and
 associated
 complications
 [1–5].
Most
 inﬂuenza
 infections
 in
 children
 are
 self-limiting,
 but
 inﬂuenza
may
 be
 severe,
 particularly
 in
 young
 children
 and
 those
 with
chronic
 medical
 conditions
 [3].

In
 the
 US,
 annual
 inﬂuenza
 vaccination
 has
 been
 recommended
for
 all
 children
 from
 six
 months
 to
 18
 years
 of
 age
 since
 the
2008–2009
 inﬂuenza
 season,
 when
 there
 were
 90
 million
 new
cases
 of
 inﬂuenza
 worldwide
 in
 children
 under
 ﬁve
 years
 old
 [6,7].
However,
 vaccine
 coverage
 rates
 among
 children
 are
 relatively
low:
 according
 to
 the
 US
 Centers
 for
 Disease
 Control
 only
 about
40%
 of
 children
 received
 an
 inﬂuenza
 vaccine
 in
 2012–2013
 [8].
One
 of
 the
 reasons
 for
 this
 poor
 uptake
 is
 that
 healthcare
 pro-
fessionals
 consider
 currently
 available
 non-adjuvanted
 seasonal
inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 to
 only
 have
 modest
 efﬁcacy
 in
 young
 children
[9,10].
The
 inﬂuenza
 virus
 evolves
 rapidly,
 evading
 immune
 responses
by
 antigenic
 shift
 and
 drift
 leading
 to
 frequent
 emergence
 of
 novel
strains
 [11]. Thus
 vaccines
 developed
 for
 seasonal
 inﬂuenza
 often
contain
 mismatched
 strains
 to
 the
 ones
 circulating
 in
 the
 popu-
lation
 the
 following
 year,
 further
 reducing
 vaccine
 effectiveness
[12,13]. Most
 licenced
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 are
 inactivated
 vaccines,
with
 split
 virion
 and
 subunit
 vaccines
 having
 been
 administered
to
 millions
 of
 people
 worldwide.
 Split
 vaccines
 are
 generated
by
 disruption
 of
 the
 inactivated
 whole
 virion
 using
 detergents
whereas
 subunit
 vaccines
 are
 enriched
 for
 hemagglutinin
 (HA)
and
 neuraminidase
 (NA)
 surface
 glycoproteins
 [14].
 Enhanced
 anti-
body
 responses
 to
 seasonal
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 have
 been
 shown
using
 MF59®, an
 oil-in-water
 emulsion
 containing
 squalene,
 as
an
 adjuvant
 [15–17]. MF59
 acts
 locally
 by
 activating
 monocytes,
macrophages
 and
 dendritic
 cells,
 which
 release
 a
 mixture
 of
cytokines
 attracting
 phagocytic
 cells
 to
 the
 injection
 site,
 result-
ing
 in
 more
 efﬁcient
 antigen-transport
 to
 the
 lymph
 nodes
 [18,19].
MF59
 has
 also
 been
 shown
 to
 enhance
 the
 immune
 response
by
 increasing
 the
 binding
 strength
 of
 antibody
 to
 the
 inﬂuenza
virus
 [16,17]
 Inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 containing
 MF59
 have
 also
 con-
sistently
 demonstrated
 an
 established
 safety
 proﬁle
 [20–23]. The
MF59-adjuvanted
 seasonal
 inﬂuenza
 vaccine,
 Fluad®, is
 recom-
mended
 in
 numerous
 countries
 for
 adults
 over
 the
 age
 of
 65,
but
 further
 research
 is
 particularly
 necessary
 to
 assess
 the
 effec-
tiveness
 and
 safety
 of
 inclusion
 of
 MF59
 adjuvant
 in
 seasonal
vaccines
 for
 children.
 In
 this
 study
 we
 compared
 the
 immunogenic-
ity
 against
 both
 homologous
 and
 heterologous
 inﬂuenza
 strains,
reactogenicity
 and
 safety
 of
 an
 MF59-adjuvanted
 trivalent
 vac-
cine,
 aTIV
 (a
 subunit
 vaccine),
 with
 that
 of
 two
 non-adjuvanted
trivalent
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines,
 TIV-1
 (the
 non-adjuvanted
 version
 of
aTIV)
 and
 TIV-2
 (a
 split
 particle
 vaccine)
 in
 children
 aged
 6
 to
 <72
months.

 Materials
 and
 methods
2.1.
 Study
 design
 and
 objectives
This
 Phase
 III,
 observer-blind,
 stratiﬁed,
 randomized
 study
 was
conducted
 at
 eight
 sites
 in
 Argentina,
 ﬁve
 in
 Australia,
 two
 in
Chile,
 12
 in
 The
 Philippines,
 and
 ﬁve
 in
 South
 Africa,
 between
 April
2011
 and
 July
 2012.
 The
 primary
 immunogenicity
 objective
 was
to
 demonstrate
 the
 non-inferior
 immunogenicity
 of
 two
 doses
 of
aTIV
 compared
 with
 TIV-1
 and
 TIV-2,
 measured
 by
 seroconversion
rates
 and
 geometric
 mean
 titers
 (GMTs)
 against
 three
 homologous
strains,
 in
 children
 aged
 6
 to
 <72
 months.
 An
 additional
 primary
objective
 was
 to
 demonstrate
 the
 non-inferiority
 of
 two
 doses
 of
TIV-1
 to
 TIV-2
 in
 children
 aged
 6
 to
 <36
 months.
 Secondary
 objec-
tives
 were:
 to
 demonstrate
 the
 superiority
 of
 aTIV
 to
 TIV-1
 and
TIV-2
 against
 homologous
 strains
 in
 children
 aged
 6
 to
 <24
 months
and
 6
 to
 <72
 months,
 to
 evaluate
 immunogenicity
 against
 het-
erologous
 strains
 in
 children
 aged
 6
 to
 <72
 months,
 and
 to
 assess
reactogenicity
 and
 safety
 of
 all
 three
 vaccines.
 The
 protocol
 was
approved
 by
 Ethics
 Review
 Committees
 in
 each
 institution,
 and
 the
study
 was
 conducted
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 Declaration
 of
 Helsinki
and
 the
 principles
 of
 Good
 Clinical
 Practice.
 Written
 informed
 con-
sent
 was
 obtained
 from
 the
 parents/legal
 guardians
 of
 all
 children
before
 enrolment.
 The
 study
 was
 registered
 with
 ClinicalTrials.gov:
NCT01346592.
2.2.
 Children
6104
 healthy
 children
 aged
 from
 6
 to
 <72
 months
 were
 enrolled.
The
 main

2.3.
 Study
 procedures
Children
 were
 stratiﬁed
 into
 three
 age
 groups
 (6
 to
 <24
 months,
24
 to
 <36
 months
 and
 36
 to
 <72
 months)
 and
 randomly
 assigned
using
 a
 web-based
 system
 to
 receive
 aTIV,
 TIV-1
 or
 TIV-2,
 with
allocation
 ratios
 3:2:2
 (6
 to
 <24
 months
 and
 24
 to
 <36
 months)
or
 4:1:1
 (36
 to
 <72
 months).
 Vaccines
 were
 administered
 on
 Days
1
 and
 29:
 children
 aged
 6
 to
 <36
 months
 received
 a
 0.25
 mL  dose
and
 children
 aged
 36
 to
 <72
 months
 received
 a

 mL  dose.
 For
immunogenicity
 analyses,
 a
 subset
 (n
 =
 2655)
 of
 children
 from
 each
age
 and
 vaccine
 group
 was
 used.
 Blood
 samples
 (5

2.5.
 Immunogenicity
 assessment
Blood
 samples
 were
 collected
 by
 venipuncture,
 centrifuged,
immediately
 stored
 at
 −18 ◦C
 or
 below
 and
 later
 transported
 to
the
 Novartis
 Vaccines
 Clinical
 Sciences
 Laboratory
 in
 Marburg,
Germany,
 where
 antibody
 responses
 against
 both
 homologous
 and
heterologous
 strains
 were
 assessed,
 in
 terms
 of
 GMTs,
 serocon-
version
 and
 seroprotection
 rates,
 by
 hemagglutination
 inhibition
(HI),
 based
 on
 the
 methods
 of
 Stephenson
 et

 [24]. Cross-reactive
antibody
 responses
 were
 tested
 against
 the
 following
 heterolo-
gous
 strains:
 A/New
 Jersey/8/1976
 (H1N1),
 A/Uruguay/716/2007
(H3N2)
 and

were
 found
 to
 be
 antigenically
 distinct
 (>4–8
 fold
 difference)
 from
the
 vaccine
 strains,
 when
 analyzed
 using

 (PPS)
 was
 used
 to
 analyze
 the
 non-
inferiority
 objective,
 i.e.
 children
 who
 were
 vaccinated
 and
had
 no
 major
 protocol
 violations.
 For
 persistence
 of

 persistence
 set
 was
 used,
 i.e.
 children
 who
were
 vaccinated
 and
 provided
 evaluable
 sera
 at
 all
 time
 points.
For
 
cross-reactive
 
antibody
 
response,
 
the
 
heterologous

 was
 used.
 For
 all

 Statistical
 signiﬁcance
A
 signiﬁcantly
 higher
 response
 was
 concluded
 if,
 for
 GMTs,
 the
lower
 bound
 of
 the
 95%
 conﬁdence
 interval
 (CI)
 around
 the
 group
ratio
 was
 >1.0,
 and,
 for
 seroconversion
 rates,
 if
 the
 lower
 bound
of
 the
 95%
 CI
 (Clopper–Pearson)
 around
 the
 group
 difference
was
 >0%.
2.7.3.
 Non-inferiority
Non-inferiority
 
was
 
concluded
 
if
 
the
 
lower
 
bound
 
of
multiplicity-adjusted
 two-sided
 CI
 (97.6%
 for
 aTIV
 and
 97.4%
for
 TIV-1
 non-inferiority
 objectives)
 exceeded
 the
 corresponding
margin
 (0.667
 for
 the
 GMTs
 and
 -10%
 for
 seroconversion)
 in
 all
 12
comparisons
 for
 aTIV
 versus
 both
 TIVs
 (2
 endpoints
 ×
 3
 strains
 ×
 2

 and
 in
 all
 six
 comparisons
 for
 TIV-1
 versus

2.7.4.
 Superiority
Superiority
 was
 concluded
 if
 the
 multiplicity
 adjusted
 one-sided
p-value
 was
 ≤1.2%
 for
 two
 out
 of
 three
 strains,
 with
 superiority
margins
 of
 1.5
 for

 data
 were
 evaluated
 descriptively
and
 expressed
 as
 the
 percentage
 of
 children
 with
 adverse
reactions/events
 in
 each
 group,
 which
 were
 categorized
 as
 mild,
moderate
 or
 severe.
 AEs

 also
 classed
 as
 not

 Results
3.1.
 Study
 population
Of
 the
 6104
 children
 enrolled
 in
 the
 study,
 6100
 were
 ran-
domized
 and
 6078
 were
 vaccinated:
 3125
 children
 received
aTIV,
 1479
 children
 received
 TIV-1,
 and
 1474
 children
 received
TIV-2.
 Demographic
 and
 other
 characteristics
 were
 balanced
between
 the
 vaccine
 groups
 (Table
 1),
 except
 for
 mean
 age,
 which
was
 higher
 in
 the
 aTIV
 group.
 This
 imbalance
 was
 addressed
in
 immunogenicity
 analyses
 by
 statistical
 adjustment
 for
 age
group.

3.2.
 Immunogenicity
3.2.1.
 Responses
 to
 homologous
 strains
By
 Day
 29,
 children
 in
 the
 aTIV
 group
 had
 signiﬁcantly
 higher
GMTs
 and
 seroconversion
 rates
 against
 all
 homologous
 strains
than
 children
 in
 either
 the
 TIV-1
 or
 the
 TIV-2
 groups
 (Fig.
 2,
Supplementary
 Table).
 The
 difference
 in
 GMTs
 between
 aTIV
 and
the
 TIVs
 had
 increased
 by
 Day
 50
 and
 remained
 signiﬁcantly
 higher
six
 months
 after
 vaccination.
 For
 children
 aged
 6
 to
 <72
 months,
aTIV
 met
 the
 statistical
 criteria
 for
 non-inferiority
 to
 both
 TIVs
against
 all
 three
 strains,
 for
 both
 GMT
 ratios
 and
 seroconversion
rates
 at
 Day
 50
 (Table
 2).
 aTIV
 also
 met
 the
 pre-deﬁned
 superiority
threshold
 against
 both
 TIVs
 in
 terms
 of
 GMTs,
 but
 not
 in
 terms
of
 seroconversion
 rates.
 For
 the
 subset
 of
 youngest
 children
 (6
to
 <24
 months),
 aTIV
 achieved
 superiority
 to
 TIV-1
 in
 both
 GMTs
and
 seroconversion
 rates
 (Table
 3).
 GMT
 ratios
 between
 aTIV
and
 TIV-2
 were
 signiﬁcantly
 higher
 than
 the
 superiority
 margin
(p-value
 <0.0001)
 but
 differences
 in
 seroconversion
 rates
 did
 not
meet
 the
 10%
 threshold
 for
 superiority
 against
 any
 strain
 in
 this
subset.
For
 the
 entire
 study
 population,
 the
 magnitude
 of
 the
 difference
in
 seroprotection
 between
 aTIV
 and
 the
 TIVs
 was
 statistically
 sig-
niﬁcant
 at
 the
 ≥40
 threshold
 titer,
 and
 increased
 at
 higher
 titers,
with
 the
 largest
 differences
 seen
 at
 titers
 of
 ≥330
 and
 above
 for
 the
A
 strains,
 and
 of
 ≥110
 and
 above
 for
 the
 B
 strain
 (Fig.
 3).
 All
 differ-
ences
 at
 titers
 of
 ≥110
 and
 above
 were
 signiﬁcant
 (p
 <
 0.01)
 for
 all
homologous
 strains.
Although
 there
 was
 evidence
 of
 TIV-1
 being
 non-inferior
 to
TIV-2
 in
 terms
 of
 both
 seroconversion
 rates
 and
 GMTs
 for
 the
A/H3N2
 and
 B
 strains,
 non-inferiority
 was
 not
 met
 for
 the
 A/H1N1
strain
 in
 terms
 of
 either
 seroconversion
 rate
 or
 GMTs
 (Table
 4),
hence
 the
 overall
 non-inferiority
 as
 deﬁned
 in
 study
 objec-
tive
 (i.e.
 non-inferiority
 met
 for
 all
 six
 measures)
 could
 not
 be
concluded.
3.2.2.
 Responses
 to
 heterologous
 strains
When
 tested
 against
 all
 three
 heterologous
 strains,
 signiﬁcantly
higher
 GMTs
 and
 seroconversion
 rates
 were
 seen
 in
 the
 aTIV
 group
compared
 with
 TIV
 groups
 at
 all
 time
 points
 post-vaccination,
except
 at
 Day
 29
 against
 the
 A/H1N1
 strain
 for
 aTIV
 compared
with
 TIV-1
 (Fig.
 4, Supplementary
 Table).
 The
 greatest
 differences
between
 aTIV
 and
 the
 two
 comparator
 vaccines
 were
 observed
against
 the
 heterologous
 A/H3N2
 strain
 after
 one
 vaccination
 (Day
29),
 and
 against
 the
 heterologous
 B
 strain
 following
 the
 complete
two-vaccination
 schedule
 (Day
 50).
3.3.
 Reactogenicity
Reported
 solicited
 adverse
 reactions
 were
 generally
 mild
 to
moderate
 and
 transient
 in
 nature.
 More
 of
 the
 older
 children
 (36
to
 <72
 months)
 in
 the
 aTIV
 group
 reported
 local
 adverse
 reaction,
including
 injection
 site
 pain,
 than
 in
 either
 TIV
 group
 (Table
 5).
 After
the
 ﬁrst
 vaccination,
 more
 of
 the
 older
 children
 in
 the
 aTIV
 group
reported
 solicited
 systemic
 adverse
 reactions,
 including
 fever,
 than
in
 the
 other
 vaccine
 groups,
 though
 the
 rates
 of
 fever
 in
 the
youngest
 age
 group
 was
 similar
 across
 the
 vaccine
 groups
 (Table
 6).
After
 the
 second
 vaccination,
 similar
 levels
 of
 systemic
 adverse
reactions
 were
 recorded
 across
 all
 vaccine
 groups,
 but
 the
 inci-
dence
 of
 fever
 remained
 slightly
 higher
 in
 the
 aTIV
 group
 for
 all
age
 groups.
 While
 low,
 the
 rate
 of
 severe
 reactions
 among
 children
in
 the
 aTIV
 group
 (0.38%)
 was
 also
 higher
 than
 in
 the
 TIV-1
 (0.07%)
or
 TIV-2
 (0.14%)
 groups.

 Safety
Overall,
 fewer
 children
 experienced
 unsolicited
 AEs
 in
 the
 aTIV
group
 (49%)
 than
 in
 the
 TIV-1
 (55%)
 or
 TIV-2
 (58%)
 groups.
 No
individual
 AE
 was
 reported
 as
 at
 least
 possibly
 related
 to
 study
vaccination
 by
 >1%
 of
 children
 in
 any
 vaccine
 group.
 The
 most
 fre-
quent
 AEs
 reported
 are
 all
 commonly
 seen
 in
 pediatric
 populations
(Table
 7).
There
 were
 eight
 deaths
 in
 the
 study:
 one
 in
 the
 aTIV
 group,
 four
in
 the
 TIV-1
 group,
 and
 three
 in
 the
 TIV-2
 group.
 None
 was
 consid-
ered
 to
 be
 related
 to
 study
 vaccination.
 Two
 other
 children
 (both
TIV-2
 group)
 experienced
 AEs
 leading
 to
 study
 withdrawal;
 neither
was
 considered
 related
 to
 study
 vaccination.
 SAEs
 were
 reported
by
 4%
 of
 children
 in
 the
 aTIV
 and
 TIV-2
 groups
 and
 5%
 of
 children
in
 the
 TIV-1
 group.
 A
 total
 of
 27
 children
 across
 vaccine
 groups
experienced
 febrile
 convulsion
 during
 the
 study.
 One
 event
 was
considered
 possibly
 related
 to
 vaccination:
 this
 occurred
 in
 a
 child
in
 the
 aTIV
 group
 on
 Day
 2,
 lasted
 less
 than
 a
 day,
 and
 was
 of
 mild
severity.

 Discussion
Currently
 available
 non-adjuvanted
 seasonal
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines
have
 only
 modest
 efﬁcacy
 in
 young
 children
 [8].
 Addition
 of
 the
MF59
 adjuvant
 has
 been
 shown
 to
 enhance
 protection
 against
inﬂuenza
 in
 another
 high-risk
 group,
 the
 elderly
 [18,27,28]. As
young
 children
 are
 the
 second
 largest
 group
 at
 risk
 of
 compli-
cations
 from
 seasonal
 inﬂuenza
 [20],
 this
 study
 compared

immunogenicity
 and
 safety
 of
 an
 MF59-adjuvanted
 inﬂuenza
 vac-
cine
 (aTIV)
 with
 two
 non-adjuvanted
 vaccines
 in
 young
 children.
While
 a
 prior
 study
 has
 demonstrated
 the
 efﬁcacy
 of
 aTIV
 in
young
 children
 [29], here
 we
 present
 the
 ﬁrst
 large
 scale
 phase
 III
study
 evaluating
 the
 immunogenicity
 and
 safety
 of
 aTIV
 versus
 US
licensed
 comparator
 vaccines
 in
 children
 6
 to
 <72
 months
 of
 age,
including
 a
 one
 year
 safety
 follow-up.
In
 this
 study,
 aTIV
 elicited
 signiﬁcantly
 higher
 GMTs
 and
seroconversion
 rates
 by
 Day
 50
 than
 either
 TIV
 vaccine,
 for
 all
 vac-
cine
 strains.
 This
 substantially
 enhanced
 immunogenicity
 mirrors
results
 from
 previous
 studies
 comparing
 aTIV
 with
 non-adjuvanted
inactivated
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 in
 young
 children,
 indicating
 an
immunogenicity
 beneﬁt
 of
 adjuvanted
 vaccines
 for
 this
 age
 group,
when
 assessed
 at
 the
 conventional
 threshold
 antibody
 titer
 (≥40)
[23,30].
As
 demonstrated
 by
 Black
 et
 al.
 [26]
 an
 HI
 titer
 ≥40
 in
 children
aged
 6
 to
 <72
 months
 was
 associated
 with
 a
 population
 clinical
protection
 level
 (against
 the
 A/H3N2
 strain)
 of
 22%,
 whereas
 a
higher
 threshold
 HI
 titer
 of
 ≥110
 was
 associated
 with
 the
 con-
ventional
 50%
 clinical
 protection
 rate
 against
 infection
 and
 titers
of
 215,
 330,
 and
 629
 predicted
 protection
 rates
 of
 70%,
 80%,
 and
90%,
 respectively
 [31,32]. In
 our
 study,
 percentages
 of
 children
 with
HI
 titers
 ≥215,
 ≥330
 and
 ≥629
 were
 signiﬁcantly
 higher
 in
 the
aTIV
 group
 than
 in
 either
 TIV
 group.
 The
 magnitude
 of
 the
 dif-
ferences
 increased
 at
 higher
 titers,
 especially
 against
 the
 B
 strain,
where
 a
 large
 difference
 between
 aTIV
 and
 TIVs
 was
 seen
 at
 titers
of
 ≥110
 and
 above.
 Thus
 the
 enhanced
 immunogenicity
 of
 aTIV
was
 more
 pronounced
 at
 titers
 that
 may
 represent
 more
 mean-
ingful
 correlates
 of
 clinical
 protection
 from
 inﬂuenza
 for
 this
 age
group.
The
 increased
 antibody
 response
 to
 aTIV
 was
 evident
 after
 a
 sin-
gle
 dose
 (measured
 on
 Day
 29).
 As
 many
 inﬂuenza
 vaccine-naïve
children
 do
 not
 complete
 the
 recommended
 two-dose
 vaccination
schedule,
 the
 increased
 immunogenicity
 of
 aTIV
 would
 poten-
tially
 increase
 protection
 against
 seasonal
 inﬂuenza
 in
 this
 age
group
 [33]. In
 addition,
 aTIV
 elicited
 a
 persistent
 antibody
 response,
echoing
 results
 from
 Vesikari
 et
 al.,
 who
 found
 that
 the
 pro-
portion
 of
 children
 with
 seroprotective
 antibody
 titers
 remained
signiﬁcantly
 higher
 for
 the
 adjuvanted
 vaccine
 six
 months
 after
initial
 vaccination
 [23]. Although
 our
 study
 did
 not
 evaluate
 vac-
cine
 efﬁcacy,
 both
 the
 signiﬁcantly
 higher
 antibody
 response
 after
one
 vaccine
 dose,
 together
 with
 the
 sustained
 response
 to
 Day
209,
 following
 the
 complete
 two-vaccination
 schedule,
 suggest
 a
potential
 enhanced
 efﬁcacy
 of
 aTIV
 in
 young
 children.
 Although
non-adjuvanted
 vaccines
 have
 a
 long
 track
 record
 of
 use
 in
 children,
they
 do
 not
 appear
 to
 induce
 satisfactory
 protective
 antibod-
ies
 in
 unprimed
 children,
 especially
 the
 very
 young,
 and
 against
inﬂuenza
 B
 strains
 [34,35]. Furthermore,
 inﬂuenza
 B
 frequently
occurs
 in
 late
 season
 outbreaks,
 so
 the
 persistence
 of
 higher
 HI
titers,
 and
 the
 maintenance
 of
 seroprotection
 until
 the
 end
 of
 the
inﬂuenza
 season
 suggests
 more
 prolonged
 protection
 against
 this
strain.
As
 the
 inﬂuenza
 virus
 evolves
 very
 rapidly,
 often
 there
 is
 anti-
genic
 mismatch
 between
 circulating
 strains
 and
 those
 included
in
 vaccines
 [36].
 Therefore,
 a
 seasonal
 vaccine
 needs
 to
 be
 able
to
 induce
 a
 broad
 cross-reactive
 antibody
 response
 against
 anti-
genically
 distinct
 inﬂuenza
 strains
 to
 increase
 the
 likelihood
 of
protection
 against
 current
 strains.
 aTIV
 induced
 signiﬁcantly
 higher
antibody
 responses
 than
 either
 TIV,
 against
 all
 three
 heterologous
strains,
 with
 the
 largest
 differences
 after
 a
 single
 vaccine
 dose
 (on
Day
 29)
 being
 seen
 against
 the
 heterologous
 A/H3N2
 strain.
 The
heterologous
 strains
 evaluated
 in
 this
 study,
 when
 tested
 against
ferret
 anti-sera,
 had
 a
 >64-fold
 difference
 in
 HI
 from
 the
 vaccine
strains
 for
 the
 A/H1N1
 and
 A/H3N2
 strains
 and
 a
 >16-fold
 difference
for
 the
 B
 strains:
 it
 is
 possible
 that
 the
 magnitude
 of
 cross-
reactive
 response
 may
 differ
 against
 a
 more
 distantly
 related
 strain.

 Although
some
 adjuvanted
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 have
 been
 linked
 to
 narcolepsy
[38], there
 is
 no
 evidence
 to
 date
 of
 an
 association
 between
 MF59-
adjuvanted
 vaccine
 receipt
 and
 narcolepsy
 [39,40]. In
 addition,
 no
case
 of
 narcolepsy
 was
 reported
 in
 this
 study.
 Overall,
 despite
 the
higher
 reactogenicity,
 the
 number
 of
 children
 completing
 the
 study
was
 similar
 for
 all
 vaccine
 groups,
 and
 the
 enhanced
 immunogenic-
ity
 of
 aTIV
 can
 be
 seen
 to
 offset
 the
 increase
 in
 mild
 to
 moderate
transient
 reactions
 experienced
 from
 the
 use
 of
 this
 vaccine.
In
 summary,
 this
 study
 demonstrates
 that
 aTIV,
 a
 trivalent
MF59-adjuvanted
 seasonal
 subunit
 inﬂuenza
 vaccine,
 induced
signiﬁcantly
 higher
 antibody
 titers
 in
 young
 children
 than
 non-
adjuvanted
 inactivated
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines,
 even
 after
 the
 ﬁrst
 dose.
The
 superior
 antibody
 responses
 after
 two
 doses
 of
 aTIV
 remained
signiﬁcantly
 higher
 than
 responses
 to
 the
 TIVs
 for
 six
 months
after
 vaccination,
 against
 both
 homologous
 and
 heterologous
 A
and
 B
 strains.
 This
 higher
 response
 was
 more
 pronounced
 when
tested
 at
 increasing
 threshold
 antibody
 titers,
 which
 may
 be
 more
appropriate
 for
 this
 age
 group.
 Thus,
 despite
 the
 increased
 reac-
togenicity,
 aTIV
 may
 therefore
 provide
 enhanced
 protection
 in
children
 aged
 6
 to
 <72
 months
 against
 both
 homologous
 and
 het-
erologous
 inﬂuenza
 strains.
