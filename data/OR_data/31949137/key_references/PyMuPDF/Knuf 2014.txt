Mass immunization of children has the potential to decrease infection rates and prevent the transmission of
inﬂuenza. We evaluated the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of different formulations of cell-derived MF59-
adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted A/H1N1 inﬂuenza vaccine in children and adolescents. This was a randomized, single-
blind, multicenter study with a total of 666 healthy subjects aged 6 months–17 y in one of 3 vaccination groups, each
receiving formulations containing different amounts of inﬂuenza A/H1N1 antigen with or without MF59. A booster
trivalent seasonal MF59 vaccine was administered one year after primary vaccinations. Antibody titers were assessed by
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization assays obtained on days 1, 22, 43, 366, and 387 (3 weeks post
booster). Safety was monitored throughout the study. One vaccination with 3.75 mg of A/H1N1 antigen formulated
with 50% MF59 (3.75_halfMF59) or 7.5 mg of A/H1N1 antigen formulated with 100% MF59 (7.5_fullMF59) induced an HI
titer 1:40 in >70% of children in the 1–<3, 3–8, and 9–17 y cohorts; however, 2 vaccinations with nonadjuvanted
15 mg A/H1N1 antigen were needed to achieve this response in the 1–<3 and 3–8 y cohorts. Among children aged 6–
11 months, 1 dose of 7.5_fullMF59 resulted in an HI titer 1:40 in >70% while 2 doses of 3.75_halfMF59 were required
to achieve this result. All vaccines were well tolerated. Our ﬁndings support the immunogenicity and safety of the
3.75_halfMF59 (2 doses for children <12 months) and 7.5_fullMF59 vaccine formulations for use in children and
adolescents aged 6 months to 17 y The use of the 3.75_halfMF59 could have the beneﬁt of antigen and adjuvant
sparing, increasing the available vaccine doses allowing vaccination of more people.
Introduction
Young people from birth to 18 y of age were at signiﬁcantly
higher risk from the 2009 A/H1N1 inﬂuenza pandemic than
older adults,1-3 with the most severe infections initially reported
in children.4 Estimates suggest that the cumulative rate of devel-
oping clinical illness was increased by 30- to 80-fold among peo-
ple aged 24 years compared with individuals aged 65 years.1
In addition to their heightened susceptibility to seasonal and pan-
demic inﬂuenza viruses, children are also important contributors
to virus transmission.5,6
Mass immunization of children is considered essential to
achieve disease control that will decrease infection rates and the
risk of viral transmission within families and communities.6-9
Health authorities and vaccine manufacturers have focused on
the development of vaccines based on the A/California/7/2009
viral strain, with various adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted formula-
tions produced using both traditional and novel methods.10 One
important advance in the manufacture of inﬂuenza vaccines is
the use of cell-culture to replace traditional egg-based produc-
tion. This technology is not dependent on the availability of
eggs, and facilitates enhanced manufacturing control and poten-
tially reduction in production lead times, all of which could be
pivotal in the event of another inﬂuenza pandemic. A number of
controlled clinical trials conﬁrm that oil-in-water adjuvants, such
as MF59, meet the qualities required of a safe vaccine for diverse
populations.11-19 In addition, MF59 has been shown to heighten
antibody response to the A/H1N1 pandemic virus18,20–24 and

has been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO)
for this indication.25 This study evaluated the immunogenicity,
safety, and tolerability of different formulations of cell-derived
MF59-adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine in
healthy children and adolescents.
Results
A total of 666 subjects were enrolled (cohort 1; n D 159;
cohort 2; n D 184; cohort 3; n D 172; cohort 4; n D 151). Data
from one site (n D 86) were excluded from the analysis as a result
of noncompliance with protocol requirements for a different
clinical study. Subject disposition and demographics are shown
in Figure 1 and Table 1, respectively.
Immunogenicity
Figure 2 shows the cumulative percentage of subjects by hem-
agglutination inhibition (HI) titer following the initial injections
(up to 43 days) in the 4 cohorts. In cohort 1 (9–17 years), there
were 13- and 24-fold increases in geometric mean titer (GMT)
in the 3.75_halfMF59 and 7.5_fullMF59 vaccine groups, respec-
tively, 3 weeks following the ﬁrst vaccination (Table 2). By day
43 (3 weeks following the second vaccination), GMT had
increased 47-fold in the 3.75_halfMF59 group and 80-fold in
the 7.5_fullMF59 group (Table 2). There were 6- to 14-fold
increases in GMT across the 3 vaccine groups at day 22 for
cohort 2 (3–8 years), with 28- to 115-fold increases across the 3
vaccine groups by day 43 (Table 2). Higher GMTs were evident
for both adjuvanted groups compared with the nonadjuvanted
group (Table 2). Three weeks following the ﬁrst vaccination for
cohort 3 (1–<3 years), there was a 6- to 7-fold increase in GMT
from baseline in the adjuvanted vaccine groups compared with a
2-fold increase in the nonadjuvanted group (Table 2). By day
43, there was an 89- to 108-fold increase in GMT in the adju-
vanted groups and an 11-fold increase in the nonadjuvanted
group (Table 2). At day 22, there was an approximate 5- to 10-
fold increase in GMT in the 3.75_halfMF59 and 7.5_fullMF59
groups, respectively, in cohort 4 (6–11 months), with a 92- to
129-fold increase by day 43 (Table 2).
All three European Committee for Medicinal Products for
Human Use (CHMP) criteria were met for both the nonadju-
vanted and adjuvanted groups following the second vaccination
(day 43) in all cohorts (Tables 3 and 4). Following the ﬁrst vacci-
nation (day 22) for the adjuvanted formulations, the 3 CHMP
criteria were met in cohorts 1, 2, and 3 and in the 7.5_fullMF59
group in cohort 4. The 3.75_halfMF59 group in cohort 4 did
not meet the criterion of HI 1:40 at day 22 but met the other 2

CHMP criteria. At day 22, the 15 mg nonadjuvanted group met
the CHMP geometric mean ratio (GMR) and seroconversion cri-
teria but not the HI 1:40 criterion in cohort 2, and did not
meet any CHMP criteria in cohort 3.
One year after the primary vaccinations, hemagglutinating
antibodies were still present in all vaccine groups in subjects of all
4 cohorts, with a trend to higher HI titers in subjects primed
with 7.5_fullMF59 (Table 3). In addition, greater persistence
was achieved in cohorts 2 and 3 in response to both doses of the
adjuvanted formulation vs. the nonadjuvanted vaccine (Table 3).
Following the booster vaccination, all vaccine groups and cohorts
achieved an HI titer 1:40.
For the post-hoc analysis using an HI titer cutoff of 1:330,
at day 43, 49–94% of subjects receiving the adjuvanted vaccines
achieved this titer (Table 5), while only 10% and 24% of subjects
achieved this titer following vaccination with the nonadjuvanted
vaccines in cohorts 2 and 3, respectively. There was no apparent
difference between the 2 adjuvanted formulations in the percen-
tages of subjects achieving HI titers 1:330. Following the
booster vaccination, 90–100% of subjects achieved an HI titer
1:330 with no difference between subjects primed with adju-
vanted or non-adjuvanted formulations.
Analysis of results from the microneutralization (MN) titer
assay revealed ﬁndings consistent with those for the HI assay,
with the percentage of subjects with MN titer 1:40 substan-
tially increased after the ﬁrst and second vaccinations. The MN
results for cohorts 2 and 3 were consistently lower for the nonad-
juvanted groups. However, almost all subjects in the 3 vaccine
groups in cohorts 2 and 3 demonstrated a 4-fold increase in MN
titers following the second vaccination. A 4-fold increase in MN
titers was evident 3 weeks after the ﬁrst vaccination for approxi-
mately 50% of subjects in both vaccine groups in cohort 4,
increasing to 100% at 3 weeks following the second vaccination
(Table 6).
Safety
For all formulations of study vaccine, the majority of soli-
cited local and systemic reactions were considered to be mild
or moderate and most subjects recovered within 7 d of onset
without sequelae (Tables 7 and 8). The rate of local and sys-
temic reactions was lower after the second vaccination for all

*Data presented for days 1–366 are derived from a re-analysis of the original dataset following protocol violation regarding the administration of the booster. This violation
required the retrospective removal of the non-compliant site data from the original dataset. Data presented for the booster correspond to the original dataset as the non-
compliant site did not contribute post-booster data. CI, conﬁdence interval; GMR, geometric mean ratio; GMT, geometric mean titer.

groups and cohorts. Within each cohort, the occurrence of
local and systemic reactions was higher in the 7.5_fullMF59
groups than the 3.75_halfMF59 groups. Systemic reactions
were reported by more subjects in the adjuvanted groups
than in the nonadjuvanted group in cohort 3, but there was
no clear difference in the occurrence of systemic reactions
between adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted groups in cohort 2.
There was lower reactogenicity in all cohorts following the
administration of the seasonal MF59 vaccine after one year.
Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) through day 43 were
reported by 32–34% of subjects in cohort 1 and 35–36% of
cohort 2, with higher rates for cohort 3 (37–61%) and for cohort
4 (63–64%). Nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, vomiting, eating disor-
der, and pyrexia were the most frequently reported unsolicited
AEs for cohorts 3 and 4 that were considered possibly related to
vaccine. The rate of unsolicited AEs following booster vaccina-
tions was low, ranging from 5% in cohort 1, 7% cohort 2, 10%
cohort 3, and 24% of subjects in cohort 4.
From day 1–546, 48 subjects experienced 65 serious AEs
(SAEs), with higher rates evident for cohorts 3 and 4. A SAE con-
sidered possibly related to vaccine was reported for 3 subjects:
multiple seizure episodes at day 98 affecting one subject in cohort
1 (7.5_fullMF59); vomiting in one subject in cohort 3, 26 d after
the third vaccination (7.5_fullMF59); and febrile convulsion at
day 10 in one subject in cohort 4 (3.75_halfMF59). Eight sub-
jects, 2 in each of the 4 cohorts (3.75_halfMF59 n D 4;
7.5_fullMF59 n D 2; 15_noMF59 n D 2), discontinued study
participation from day 1–546 due to at least one AE, with all
withdrawals occurring before administration of the booster. No
deaths occurred during the study.
Discussion
Effective, well-tolerated A/H1N1 vaccines are needed for chil-
dren, particularly those aged 6–12 months, who are at high risk
of contracting the virus due to lack of protection and priming of
the immune system by exposure to the inﬂuenza virus. Children
also contribute to virus transmission to family members and the
community at large.5,6 Our results demonstrate that nonadju-
vanted A/H1N1 vaccines are less immunogenic than adjuvanted
formulations for children. Low immunogenicity of nonadju-
vanted vaccines in children has also been observed in other stud-
ies; for example, HI titers 1:40 were observed in 45% and 69%
of subjects aged 6–35 months and 3–9 years, respectively, follow-
ing a single dose of nonadjuvanted A/California/07/2009 vac-
cine, compared with rates of 95% and 94% in subjects aged 18–
64 y and 65 years, respectively.26
Our
study
showed
that
one
vaccination
with
3.75_halfMF59 or 7.5_fullMF59 induced an HI titer of
1:40 in >70 % of children and adolescents in the 1–<3
year, 3–8 year, and 9–17 y cohorts; however, 2 vaccinations
with nonadjuvanted 15 mg A/H1N1 antigen were needed to
achieve a similar response in the 1–<3 and 3–8 y cohorts.
Among children aged 6–11 months, 1 dose of the fully adju-
vanted vaccine was associated with an HI titer of 1:40 in
>70% of children while 2 doses of the half-adjuvant formu-
lation were required to achieve the same result. On a practi-
cal level, and considering cost effectiveness, administering 1
vaccine dose rather than 2 doses would be preferable. How-
ever, this approach would require commercial availability of
the
2
presentations
(3.75_halfMF59
and
7.5_fullMF59)
which, during the very hectic times of a pandemic, may not
be easy to achieve. A study conducted in children and adoles-
cents aged 6 months to 18 y found that a single 15 mg dose
of A/H1N1 monovalent vaccine resulted in HI titers 1:40
in >70% of those aged 9 to <18 years of age; however a sin-
gle 7.5 or 15 mg dose did not achieve the same result in sub-
jects 6 months to 8 y of age.27 Together, these results suggest
that the number and formulation of adjuvant vaccine doses
should be tailored to children’s age in order to achieve HI
titers 1:40.
Our study established that the 3 CHMP criteria for immu-
nogenicity were met 3 weeks following administration of the
booster adjuvanted vaccine in the 4 cohorts across all vaccine
groups. This was the case regardless of the priming formulation
and irrespective of HI titers at day 366. However, one concern
with the CHMP criteria is that they are based on studies con-
ducted in adults and the applicability of these criteria for studies
in children is not clear. While we were conducting this study, a
separate study in 777 vaccine-na€ıve children aged 6–72 months
50 d following administration of 2 doses of MF59-adjuvanted
seasonal vaccine was published.28 Findings from this study sug-
gested that the conventional adult HI titer of 1:40 is only
associated
with
22%
protection
in
children
aged
6–72
months.28 Notably, titers of 1:110, 1:215, 1:330, and 1:629
were associated with protection rates of 50%, 70%, 80%, and
90%, respectively. The investigators concluded that a titer of
1:330 would have more favorable public health implications.
To address this, we conducted a post-hoc analysis to establish
the percentages of subjects achieving an HI titer 1:330. We
observed that at day 43, 49–94% of subjects receiving the adju-
vanted vaccines achieved this titer, compared with only 10%
and 24% of subjects in cohorts 2 and 3 following vaccination
with the nonadjuvanted vaccines. Following the booster, 90
% of subjects achieved an HI titer 1:330, with no difference
between those subjects primed with adjuvanted or non-adju-
vanted vaccine.
All study vaccines were safe and well tolerated, with the major-
ity of solicited reactions mild and self-limiting. The safety proﬁle
of the adjuvanted vaccine was generally similar to that of the non-
adjuvanted vaccine, including in subjects who received repeat
doses of the adjuvanted formulation; in line with previous stud-
ies, local reactogenicity was higher with the adjuvanted formula-
tion, especially in older age groups.29 Furthermore, the safety
proﬁle of the cell-derived vaccine was similar to the safety proﬁle
previously reported for an equivalent egg-derived vaccine.30
Together, these ﬁndings support the acceptable safety proﬁle of
the cell-derived halfMF59 and fullMF59 formulations when
administered with 3.75 mg or 7.5 mg of A/H1N1 antigen to
children aged 6 months to 17 y

Our ﬁndings support the immunogenicity and acceptable
safety of the cell-derived MF59-adjuvanted A/H1N1 inﬂuenza
vaccine in children aged 6 months to 17 y.
Methods
Study design and objectives
This randomized, single-blind, dose-ranging study was con-
ducted between 2009 and 2011 at 8 centers in Germany, 2 in
Belgium, 2 in the Dominican Republic, and one in the Nether-
lands. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review
Board or Ethics Committee at each center and the study was con-
ducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Written informed consent
was obtained from each subject or their legal guardians before
enrollment. The study was registered with the National Institutes
of Health database, ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00971100).
The primary study objective was to identify the preferred vac-
cine formulation (with or without MF59), dosage of antigen and
adjuvant, and schedule (1 or 2 administrations) of the cell-
derived A/H1N1 monovalent vaccine in healthy children and
adolescents. Secondary objectives included evaluation of long-
term persistence of antibodies and vaccine safety throughout the
study.
Subjects
Eligible subjects were healthy males and females aged 6
months to 17 y on the day of enrollment without documented
inﬂuenza in the 3 months preceding enrollment. Inﬂuenza was
considered documented by positive serology test, viral culture, or
rapid antigen tests. Exclusion criteria are detailed in the supple-
mentary section.
Four cohorts were enrolled: children aged 9–17 y (cohort 1),
3–8 y (cohort 2), 1–<3 years (cohort 3), and 6–11 months
(cohort 4).
Vaccines
Each subject received 2 doses of one of 3 vaccine formulations
(3.75_halfMF59, 7.5_fullMF59 and 15_noMF59 containing
3.75, 7.5 and 15 mg A/H1N1 and 0.125, 0.25 and 0 mL MF59
adjuvant, respectively), (Supplementary Table 1) administered
approximately 3 weeks apart. One year after the ﬁrst vaccination,
subjects received a booster with the trivalent seasonal MF59 vac-
cine (Fluad) recommended for the 2010/11 inﬂuenza season
(15 mg antigen from each inﬂuenza strain [including A/H1N1]
C 0.35 mL MF59). A second dose of trivalent seasonal vaccine
was administered 3 weeks after the booster to na€ıve subjects
<9 years of age, to complete the primary immunization against
inﬂuenza according to WHO recommendations. Vaccinations
were administered by intramuscular injection in the deltoid mus-
cle of the non-dominant arm and the anterolateral thigh for chil-
dren 24 months and <24 months, respectively.
Immunogenicity analysis
Blood samples were taken on day 1 prior to vaccination, on
days 22, 43, and 366 following the ﬁrst vaccination, and on day
387 (3 weeks after the booster). Immunogenicity was evaluated
by homologous (A/California/7/2009) H1N1 strain-speciﬁc HI
and MN assays. Immunogenicity measures were: 1) GMT for HI
and MN for the primary vaccine and for the booster; 2) GMR of
HI and MN; 3) percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion
(HI 1:40 for subjects negative at baseline [HI <1:10]), or a sig-
niﬁcant increase in HI (minimum 4-fold increase in HI titer for
subjects positive at baseline); 4) percentage of subjects with a
MN titer 1:40, 1:80, and 1:160; 5) percentage of subjects with
an HI titer 1:40; and 6) percentage of subjects achieving a min-
imum 4-fold increase in MN titer. Following publication of HI
antibody titers necessary for protection for inactivated inﬂuenza
vaccines in children, a further analysis was conducted to evaluate
the percentage of subjects with an HI titer 1:330.28
Safety analysis
Safety reactions were collected on diary cards and reviewed at
each follow-up visit. The safety analysis included the number of
subjects exposed to study vaccine with solicited local and systemic
reactions and unsolicited AEs reported per group. Solicited reac-
tions occurring within 7 d post each vaccination were considered
indicators of reactogenicity that might possibly be related to
study vaccine. These included local and systemic reactions col-
lected for 7 d following each vaccination.
All unsolicited AEs were collected for 3 weeks following each
vaccination. All AEs resulting in study discontinuation, SAEs,
onset of chronic health conditions, and associated medications
were collected for the whole study (i.e., days 1–546).
Statistical analysis
Approximately 720 subjects (80 per age group receiving adju-
vanted vaccines; 40 per age group in cohorts 2 and 3 receiving
non-adjuvanted vaccines) were planned for study enrollment to
provide adequate power for evaluation of the primary endpoint.
Sample size was deﬁned as sufﬁcient to provide adequate esti-
mates for the endpoints speciﬁed in the CHMP criteria, and was
calculated to demonstrate non-inferiority with a power of 90%,
if the real GMT ratio is 0.93.The full analysis set included all
subjects who received a study vaccination and provided at least
one evaluable serum sample before and after baseline. The per-
protocol set (PPS) comprised all subjects who received the correct
doses of vaccine, provided evaluable serum samples at the appro-
priate time points, and had no major protocol violations. The
PPS was the primary analysis set for the immunogenicity
analyses.
Immunogenicity criteria comprised those of the CHMP for
adults,31 including: 1) the percentage of subjects with seroconver-
sion or signiﬁcant increase in HI antibody is >40%; 2) the per-
centage of subjects achieving an HI titer 1:40 is >70%; and 3)
GMR is 2.5. All three criteria assessed at day 43 and at least
one of the 3 criteria assessed 3 weeks post-booster dose had to be
met by each cohort to fulﬁll regulatory requirements. Results

from day 22 following the ﬁrst vaccination were also evaluated
against these criteria. Vaccine group differences were assessed
using 2-way analysis of variance with factors for vaccine group
and center.
The safety population included all subjects who received study
vaccination and provided post-baseline safety data. Descriptive
statistics were calculated for all safety data and expressed as the
proportion and number of subjects with solicited local or sys-
temic reactions, unsolicited AEs, SAEs, and AEs resulting in
study discontinuation. All statistical analyses were performed by
Novartis Vaccines using SAS, version 9.1 or higher.
