VACCINE REPORTS
Background: The successful vaccination of children 6 to 36 months of age 
against 2009 A/H1N1 influenza was essential to help reduce the burden of 
pandemic disease in both the pediatric and adult populations.
Objectives: We compared the immunogenicity and safety of 4 alternative 
monovalent vaccine formulations to identify which provided optimal levels 
of seroprotection according to the US and European Union (EU) licensure 
criteria.
Subjects and Methods: A total of 654 healthy subjects (6 to <36 months 
old) were given 2 vaccine doses 3 weeks apart. Participants were assigned 
to 1 of the 4 immunization groups, receiving MF59-adjuvanted (Novartis 
Vaccines, Marburg, Germany) vaccine either containing 3.75 μg or 7.5 μg of 
A/H1N1 California/7/2009 antigen, or nonadjuvanted vaccine containing 
7.5 μg or 15 μg of antigen. Antibody titers were assessed by hemaggluti­
nation inhibition assay 3 weeks, 3 months and 1 year after immunization. 
Vaccine safety was monitored throughout the study.
Results: After 1 dose, both adjuvanted formulations met the US and EU cri­
teria for seroconversion; the 15 μg nonadjuvanted vaccine met the EU cri­
terion for seroconversion alone. The US and EU criteria for seroprotection 
were only met by adjuvanted groups. MF59-adjuvanted formulations alone 
resulted in clinically significant persisting antibody titers after 12 months. 
All vaccines were well tolerated.
Conclusions: A single dose of MF59-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 
μg A/H1N1 antigen was highly immunogenic, met both the US and EU 
licensure criteria and was well tolerated. These data support the suitability 
of this monovalent vaccine formulation for pandemic use in children 6 to 
<36 months of age.

he 1918 to 1920 H1N1 influenza pandemic was the most severe 
in recent history, resulting in ~45 million deaths. Although par­
tially sharing the same H1 antigenicity, the A/H1N1 virus respon­
sible for the 2009 to 2010 pandemic is much less virulent than 
the 1918 virus.1 The pediatric population was disproportionally

affected by the 2009 to 2010 influenza pandemic,2 with infection 
rates 4 times greater in the children of the United Kingdom than 
in adults.3,4 Globally, the majority of severe pandemic A/H1N1 
influenza infections initially reported occurred in children.5 The 
pediatric population plays a major role in the transmission of the 
influenza virus within a community6,7 and is therefore, considered 
a high-priority group for vaccination against pandemic influenza.8 
Modeling analyzes suggest that the mass immunization of children 
is essential for optimal disease control,9–11 reducing infection rates 
and viral transmission within families and consequently the wider 
community.12 Based on prior experience with trivalent, seasonal 
influenza vaccines, the Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices recommended that all children <9 years of age should be 
given 2 doses of monovalent A/H1N1 influenza vaccine at least 3 
weeks apart in the 2009 to 2010 influenza season.8
Young children and infants have relatively limited exposure 
to influenza and usually remain immunologically naive to viral 
antigens. It has been shown that previous receipt of seasonal influ­
enza vaccine does not result in the production of cross-reactive 
antibodies able to provide heterologous immunity to the A/H1N1 
pandemic virus.13,14 Such poor immunogenicity can be overcome 
with the use of oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants, such as MF59 
(Novartis Vaccines, Marburg, Germany). The use of such adjuvants 
for 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic vaccines was endorsed by the World 
Health Organization.15 MF59 has a well-established safety pro­
file,16 supported by >13 years of postmarketing and clinical safety 
data, with >158 million doses of MF59-adjuvanted vaccine distrib­
uted to date.17
This phase II/III, randomized study was conducted in 
healthy children to evaluate antibody responses to 4 different A/
H1N1 vaccine formulations, varying in adjuvant and antigen con­
tent, to identify the vaccine formulation and administration sched­
ule that offered optimal levels of seroprotection against pandemic 
A/H1N1 influenza in children from 6 to <36 months of age.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Objectives
This phase II/III, randomized, multicenter, observer-blind 
study was conducted across 29 sites in the United States and 
Mexico, between October 2009 and December 2010. The protocol 
was approved by a central Institutional Review Board for all 
study centers in the United States. For study centers in Mexico, 
the protocol was approved by the National Institute of Medical 
Sciences and Nutrition and the Federal Commission for Protection 
Against Health Risks. The study was conducted in accordance with 
the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical 
Practice. Before enrollment, written informed consent was obtained 
from the legal guardians of each participant. The primary objective 
of this study was to assess the immunogenicity of 4 distinct A/H1N1 
vaccine formulations in pediatric subjects according to the criteria 
defined by the US Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research

(CBER) and the European Committee for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (CHMP). Secondary objectives were to demonstrate 
superior antibody titers in response to MF59-adjuvanted vaccines 
compared with nonadjuvanted formulations, to assess long-term 
antibody persistence and to evaluate the reactogenicity and safety 
profiles for each vaccine.
Subjects
The exclusion criteria were laboratory-confirmed influenza 
disease within 6 months before study day 1; any acute illness within 
3 days before vaccination; hypersensitivity to any vaccine compo­
nent; an impaired or altered immune system; receipt of any inac­
tivated or live vaccines within 2 weeks and 4 weeks before study 
day 1, respectively; fever (axillary ≥37.5°C, oral ≥38.0°C, rectal 
≥38.5°C, tympanic membrane ≥37.7°C) within 3 days before vac­
cination; use of analgesic/antipyretic medication within 24 hours of 
vaccination; and receipt of influenza or routine childhood vaccines 
7 days before or after the administration of investigational vaccine.
Vaccines and Subject Groups
The investigational, monovalent, influenza vaccine, Rexibel 
(Novartis Vaccines, Liverpool, United Kingdom), contains hemag­
glutinin and neuraminidase surface antigens derived from the influ­
enza strain A/H1N1 California/7/2009. The vaccine seed A/H1N1 
virus was prepared from the reassortant virus NYMC X-179A 
(New York Medical College, New York) generated from the A/Cali­
fornia/7/2009 strain, as recommended by the World Health Organi­
zation.18 The 4 vaccination groups were group A (3.75-Half MF59) 
received two 0.25 mL MF59 (Novartis Vaccines)-adjuvanted 
doses containing 3.75 μg A/H1N1 antigen; group B (7.5-No MF59) 
received two 0.25 mL nonadjuvanted doses containing 7.5 μg 
antigen; group C (7.5-Half MF59) received two 0.38 mL MF59-
adjuvanted doses containing 7.5 μg antigen and group D (15-No 
MF59) received two 0.5 mL nonadjuvanted doses containing 15 μg 
antigen. A standard dose of MF59 contains 9.75 mg of squalene, 
as found in the licensed, seasonal, trivalent influenza vaccine, 
Fluad (Novartis Vaccines). In this study, subjects in groups A and 
C received vaccine containing half a standard dose of MF59 (4.88 
mg squalene per dose). Adjuvanted vaccines were prepared by pre­
mixing prefilled syringes containing A/H1N1 antigen and separate 
vials of MF59 adjuvant. The preferred sites of vaccine adminis­
tration were the anterolateral thigh and the deltoid muscle of the 
nondominant arm for children <24 months and 24 to <36 months 
of age, respectively.
Immunogenicity Assessment
Blood samples were centrifuged immediately after col­
lection; sera were stored at a temperature of −18°C or below and 
shipped to the Novartis Vaccines Clinical Serology Laboratory in 
Marburg, Germany, where antibody responses were assessed by 
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. The HI assay was based on 
the method of Stephenson et al.19 HI titer is expressed as the recip­
rocal of the highest dilution at which hemagglutination was totally 
inhibited. For subjects seronegative (titer <10) at baseline (day 1), 
seroconversion or a significant increase in HI antibody titer was 
defined as a postvaccination titer ≥40. For subjects seropositive 
(≥10) at baseline, seroconversion or a significant increase in HI 
antibody titer was defined as a >4-fold increase. Assays were per­
formed using the vaccine antigen strain A/H1N1 California/7/2009.
Safety Assessment
The subjects’ parents or legal guardians were provided with 
diary cards and asked to record the occurrence of any adverse local 
or systemic reactions. The frequency and severity of all solicited 
or unsolicited adverse reactions were recorded for 6 days after 
the day of each vaccination. Information on any serious adverse 
events, adverse events necessitating the nonroutine consultation of 
a physician or adverse events leading to withdrawal from the study 
were collected throughout the entire study period (days 1–387). 
Vaccinees were observed for 30–60 minutes after each immuniza­
tion to monitor for immediate adverse reactions. All subjects were 
physically assessed for general well-being at each clinic visit. The 
investigator used a standard scale to grade adverse events, in which 
symptoms were defined as mild, moderate or severe if they resulted 
in no limitation of, some limitation of or inability to perform nor­
mal daily activities, respectively.
Statistical Analyses
A sample size of at least 150 subjects per vaccination group 
was estimated to provide sufficient power to examine the primary 
study objective. No assumptions and power considerations were 
made for secondary objectives. No formal statistical hypothesis 
associated with the immunogenicity objectives of this study was 
tested, immunogenicity endpoints being based on licensure crite­
ria established by CBER and CHMP. The following CBER criteria 
for pandemic influenza vaccines applied: the lower bound of the 
2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the percent of subjects 
achieving seroconversion for HI antibody should be ≥40% (sero­
conversion criterion); and the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% 
CI for the percent of subjects achieving an HI antibody titer ≥40 
should be ≥70% (seroprotection criterion). No CHMP criteria were 
established for subjects <18 years of age, therefore, the follow­
ing adult CHMP criteria were applied: the percentage of subjects 
achieving seroconversion for HI antibody should be ≥40% (sero­
conversion criterion); geometric mean ratio should be >2.5 and the 
percentage of subjects achieving an HI antibody titer ≥40% should 
be >70% (seroprotection criterion). To assess the superiority/non­
inferiority of antibody responses to MF59-adjuvanted compared 
with nonadjuvanted vaccine, pairwise comparisons were performed 
for geometric mean antibody titer (GMT) ratios between vaccine 
groups. For each pairwise vaccine group compared, least squares 
GMT and associated 2-sided 95% CI, and median, minimum and 
maximum HI titer values were determined. Log10-transformed anti­
body responses were modeled using analysis of variance including 
a factor for vaccine group and study centre. CIs were calculated and 
assessed against the margins of 0.5 for noninferiority, and 0.667 for 
superiority. The superiority hypothesis was tested using a margin 
of 1. No statistical null hypothesis was associated with the safety 
objective, which was analyzed descriptively.
RESULTS
A total of 654 healthy children 6 to <36 months of age were 
enrolled. Of the 164, 165, 160 and 165 subjects assigned to vac­
cination groups A, B, C and D, 159 (97%), 155 (94%), 155 (97%) 
and 157 (95%) completed the study on day 43, respectively (Fig. 1). 
The demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects enrolled 
into each of the 4 vaccine groups are described in Table 1. Because 
there was a >10% difference (12%) between full analysis set (FAS) 
and per protocol set (PPS) subject numbers, immunogenicity was 
analyzed using CBER and CHMP criteria in both population sets 
and the respective subgroups. Superiority and noninferiority analy­
ses were performed using full analysis set and per protocol set data, 
respectively.
Immunogenicity
Analysis of antibody responses against the vaccine influ­
enza antigen A/H1N1/California/7/2009 by HI assay is shown 
in Table 2. At baseline (day 1), HI titers against the vaccine antigen

strain were low, with titers >40 observed in 9%–19% of subjects 
across all vaccination groups. Three weeks (day 22) after the 
administration of a first vaccine dose on day 1, only the adjuvanted 
vaccine groups A (74%) and C (80%) met the CBER criterion 
for seroconversion, with 32% and 44% of subjects achieving 
seroconversion in the nonadjuvanted groups B and D, respectively. 
Three weeks (day 43) after the administration of a second vaccine 
dose on day 22, the CBER criterion for seroconversion was met 
by all vaccination groups (98%, 68%, 98% and 76% in groups A, 
B, C and D, respectively). The CHMP criterion for seroconversion 
was met on day 22 by both adjuvanted vaccine groups A and C, 
and the nonadjuvanted/high antigen dose group D. On day 43, 
all vaccine groups met the CHMP criterion for seroconversion. 
On day 22, HI antibody titers ≥40 were achieved by 79%, 37%, 
86% and 50% of subjects in groups A, B, C and D, respectively. 
Therefore, only those groups receiving adjuvanted vaccine met 
the CBER and CHMP criteria for seroprotection on day 22. On 
day 43, the CBER and CHMP criteria for seroprotection were 
met by the adjuvanted vaccine groups A and C (both 100%), 
and the nonadjuvanted/high antigen dose group D (81%); the 
nonadjuvanted/low antigen dose group B did not meet either 
licensure criteria, with 70% of subjects achieving an HI titer 
>40. Analysis of long-term antibody persistence found that only 
subject groups immunized with the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine 
FIGURE 1.  Enrolled subjects from 6 to <36 months of age (n = 654) were assigned to 1 of 4 vaccination groups to receive a 
total of 2 vaccine doses, the first dose administered on day 1, the second on day 22. Immunogenicity was assessed 3 weeks 
after the administration of each vaccine dose. Long-term antibody persistence was analyzed approximately 6 and 12 months 
after immunization.

formulations displayed persisting antibody titers sufficient to 
meet the CBER licensure criterion for seroprotection (Table 2). 
Both 3.75 μg and 7.5 μg adjuvanted formulations resulted in 
persisting, seroprotective antibody titers of clinical significance 
on day 202 (96% and 100%, respectively) and day 387 (85% and 
84%, respectively).
The distribution of HI antibody titers against the vaccine 
strain A/H1N1/California/7/2009 is illustrated in Figure 2. Median 
antibody responses show adjuvanted vaccine formulations (groups 
A and C) elicited considerably higher antibody titers after first and 
second immunizations. The heightened antibody response to adju­
vanted vaccine resulted in >95% of subjects receiving MF59 hav­
ing an HI titer ≥120 on day 43. Both adjuvanted groups had similar 
antibody distribution, showing the 3.75 μg and 7.5 μg formulations 
to be equally immunogenic. The steeper slopes observed for the 
adjuvanted vaccine groups indicate less variability in antibody dis­
tribution among those receiving MF59. In the nonadjuvated vac­
cine groups, higher HI antibody titers were consistently observed 
in response to the 15 μg antigen dose.
Administration of the first vaccine dose resulted in ~9- and 
3-fold increases (day 1 to day 22) in GMTs for adjuvanted and 
nonadjuvanted groups, respectively (Fig. 3). Three weeks after the 
second vaccine dose, GMTs were increased from baseline values 
by ~65-fold for adjuvanted and 13-fold for nonadjuvanted groups. 
GMTs in response to the adjuvanted vaccines were superior 
to GMTs in response to the nonadjuvanted formulations after 
both first and second doses; the 3.75-Half MF59 vaccine was 
noninferior to the 7.5-Half MF59 formulation. Further subgroup 
analysis showed that antibody responses were higher in those 
subjects with seropositive (≥10) compared with seronegative 
(<10) baseline titers and that recent immunization with seasonal 
influenza vaccine did not influence the immune response to the 
investigational vaccines. Persisting antibody GMTs up to 1 year 
after vaccination are illustrated in Figure 3. Increased antigen 
dose was found to have little impact on antibody persistence 
(days 202 and 387) within both the adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted 
groups. Long-term GMTs were considerably higher in response

to MF59-adjuvanted vaccines when compared with nonadjuvanted 
formulations.
Safety
The percentages of subjects reporting local and systemic 
adverse reactions were similar for all 4 groups following first 
(57%–64%) and second (42%–53%) vaccine doses (Table 3). No 
trend toward increased local or systemic reactions was observed 
in those subjects receiving MF59-adjuvanted vaccines. Across all 
groups, the most commonly reported local reaction was tenderness 
at the site of injection, experienced by 26%–33% and 18%–24% 
of subjects after first and second vaccine doses, respectively. The 
majority of local reactions were mild and transient, severe local 
reactions were only reported after administration of the first 
vaccine dose (1% of subjects). The most commonly reported 
systemic reactions were irritability, reported by 24%–28% and 
15%–26% of subjects and sleepiness, reported by 18%–24% 
and 11%–18% of subjects after first and second vaccine doses, 
respectively. Severe systemic reactions were experienced by <2% 
of subjects in each vaccine group. Adverse events were reported 
by 56%–72% of subjects across all 4 vaccination groups, <30% 
of which were considered to be vaccine-related. Three subjects 
experienced serious adverse events (intussusception, subcutane­
ous abscess and staphylococcal abscess), none of which were vac­
cine-related. During the 12-month follow-up period, 22 subjects 
reported serious adverse events (16 in the nonadjuvanted vaccine 
groups and 6 in the adjuvanted groups), none of which were con­
sidered to be vaccine-related.

DISCUSSION
The relatively poor performance of nonadjuvanted A/
H1N1 vaccines in children 6–36 months of age, and therefore, 
the need for adjuvanted formulations in this age group is 
well documented. The relationship between age and levels of 
seroprotection resulting from A/H1N1 vaccination is evident in 
a recent report from Plennevaux et al.20 Seroprotection rates of 
45%, 69%, 95% and 94% were observed in subjects 6–35 months, 
3–9 years, 18–64 years and ≥65 years of age, respectively, 
3 weeks after receiving 1 dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine 
containing 7.5 μg of A/California/07/2009 antigen; a similar 
pattern was also observed with a 15 μg antigen dose. This earlier 
study found 1 vaccine dose to be sufficient for adults, but not for 
6- to 36-month-old subjects, suggesting the need for adjuvant in 
this age group. Clark et al21 also demonstrated that there is no 
requirement for adjuvant in the adult population, finding little 
difference in numbers achieving seroconversion after receiving 
nonadjuvanted (72%) and MF59-adjuvanted (73%) A/H1N1 
vaccine. The present trial found that 2 doses of nonadjuvanted 
vaccine containing 7.5 μg of antigen were required to meet 
the CBER and CHMP criteria for seroconversion. A similar 
trial conducted in 6- to <36-month-old children also found 
that 2 doses of nonadjuvanted vaccine containing 7.5 μg of A/
California/07/2009 antigen were required to meet the licensure 
criteria, with 6% and 56% of subjects achieving seroconversion 
after first and second doses, respectively.22
A study by Waddington et al23 provides further evidence 
of the benefits of adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine in the 6- to 
36-month-old age group. Two doses of either adjuvanted or non­
adjuvanted vaccine were administered, containing 1.9 μg or 7.5 
μg of A/California/07/2009 antigen, respectively. Despite the 
nonadjuvanted vaccine containing a much higher antigen dose, 
considerably higher antibody titers were observed in response 
to the adjuvanted vaccine. Trials of an AS03-adjuvanted 
monovalent A/H1N1 vaccine also found the administration 
of a single adjuvanted vaccine dose to be sufficient to induce 
adequate levels of seroprotection in subjects under 3 years of 
age24; 2 vaccine doses containing either 1.9 μg or 3.75 μg of A/
California/07/2009 antigen were given 3 weeks apart and immu­
nogenicity assessed 21 days after each immunization. Following 
the first vaccine doses, 99% and 98% of subjects were found to 
achieve seroconversion in response to 1.9 and 3.75 μg vaccine 
formulations, respectively.
The identification of an MF59-adjuvanted vaccine formu­
lation as optimal has 3 major benefits. First, MF59 allows for 
reduced antigen content,25–28 ensuring dose-sparing and therefore, 
the widest possible vaccine supply from the limited manufac­
turing capacity. Second, as well as heightening the homologous 
antibody response against vaccine strain antigen, MF59 has been 
shown to enhance levels of heterologous immunity by increas­
ing cross-reactive antibody production,25,27,29–31 a quality of great 
importance during the later stages of a pandemic, when viral 
mutation is a major concern. Third, these data and other stud­
ies demonstrate that MF59 increases long-term antibody per­
sistence,31,32 promoting the presence of antibody titers sufficient 
to meet seroprotection licensure criterion for as long as 1 year 
after immunization. All study participants were deemed healthy 
on enrollment, and therefore, the results of this trial cannot be 
applied to children affected by any chronic disease or the immu­
nocompromised. The observed levels of long-term antibody per­
sistence were the result of a 2-dose vaccination schedule; further 
investigation is required to confirm that persisting antibody titers 
are not significantly decreased following the single dose adminis­
tration schedule identified as optimal.
