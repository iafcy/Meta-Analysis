Background: Children have high morbidity and hospitalization rates from
seasonal inﬂuenza. Meta-analyses suggest that conventional inactivated
inﬂuenza vaccines are of low efﬁcacy in young children, making vaccines
that induce greater and broader immune protection in this vulnerable
population a medical priority. Adjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccines may offer a
solution.
Subjects and Methods: Unprimed healthy children (6 to 36 months)
were enrolled in an observer-blinded study and randomly assigned to
receive 2 doses of MF59-adjuvanted vaccine (Sub/MF59, n  130) or
nonadjuvanted split vaccine (split, n  139); subgroups of these (n  43
and 46, respectively) received a booster dose 1 year later. Safety and
clinical tolerability were assessed after each dose. Hemagglutination inhi-
bition antibody titers were measured against inﬂuenza A and B strains
included in the formulation of the vaccines and against mismatched strains.
Results: Clinical tolerability and safety were generally comparable be-
tween vaccine groups, though some transient, mild solicited reactions were
more frequent in the Sub/MF59 group. Postvaccination hemagglutination
inhibition antibody titers to all 3 vaccine strains were signiﬁcantly higher
with Sub/MF59 than with split vaccine (all comparisons P  0.001) after
each of the 3 vaccine doses. In addition, Sub/MF59 induced signiﬁcantly
higher cross-reactivity against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 mismatched strains.
Conclusion: MF59-adjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccine was well tolerated in
healthy young children after each of 3 doses and induced greater, longer-
lasting, and broader immune responses than a nonadjuvanted split vaccine.
The enhanced immunogenicity of the adjuvanted vaccine was most evident
in very young children and for the B vaccine strain.

ecent studies on the medical1–3 and socioeconomic4 impact of
inﬂuenza have increasingly highlighted the burden of inﬂuenza
disease in young children and the unmet need for effective vac-
cines for this age group. Conventional trivalent inactivated vac-
cines have a long-track record in the pediatric population, but they
do not appear to effectively induce protective antibodies in young
unprimed children,5,6 resulting in only modest efﬁcacy. Vaccine
efﬁcacy may be even further compromised in years when there is
a mismatch between the viral variants included in the vaccine and
the strains actually in circulation.7
The combination of the inherently lower immunogenicity of
conventional seasonal inﬂuenza vaccines in children and potential
strain mismatch creates a challenge for development of more efﬁca-
cious inﬂuenza vaccines, especially in vulnerable subjects such as
very young children.
One potential strategy to improve immunogenicity is to use
adjuvanted vaccines. MF59 is an oil-in-water emulsion containing
naturally occurring squalene oil, and a biodegradable and biocom-
patible adjuvant. MF59 is thought to act by recruiting and activat-
ing antigen-presenting cells at the injection site, thus increasing
their capacity to capture, transport, and process the coadministered
antigens.8
MF59 was ﬁrst approved for human use in 1997 as an inﬂu-
enza subunit vaccine adjuvant for the elderly. MF59-adjuvanted
inﬂuenza subunit vaccine has been shown to induce greater immuno-
responses than nonadjuvanted comparators, especially those with low
prevaccination antibody titers. It also has a good safety proﬁle in
vulnerable populations such as the elderly.9–11 Furthermore, in these
populations MF59-adjuvanted vaccine conferred broader immunoge-
nicity than conventional vaccines against drifted strains, and espe-
cially against mismatched A/H3N2 inﬂuenza antigens.12–14
The MF59 adjuvant has been administered previously to
toddlers and infants in candidate vaccines against cytomegalovi-
rusand human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1. These MF59-adju-
vanted vaccines were well tolerated and immunogenic in young
children.15,16
We assessed the immunogenicity, clinical tolerability, and
safety of primary and booster doses of an MF59-adjuvanted
inactivated inﬂuenza subunit vaccine in comparison with a con-
ventional nonadjuvanted split vaccine in healthy children. We also
assessed the ability of the vaccines to elicit an immune response
against drifted inﬂuenza viruses.
METHODS
Study Design
The primary observer-blind, randomized study was per-
formed in Finland between November 2006 and August 2007 in
healthy children aged 6 to 36 months, not previously vaccinated
against inﬂuenza. Parents of children who completed the ﬁrst proof
of concept study were invited to include their children in an extension
trial (between November 2007 and June 2008) to assess the safety and
immunogenicity of a third dose of the same vaccine, administered
approximately 1 year later. For both studies, exclusion criteria in-
cluded known allergy to any vaccine component, known or suspected
neurologic reactions following inﬂuenza vaccination, any acute infec-
tious or respiratory disease requiring systemic treatment up to 30 days
before the study start and laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza disease in
the previous 6 months.
Designated unblinded study site staff prepared and admin-
istered vaccine according to a computer-generated randomization
list and had no further contact with subjects or access to data. The
investigator and all other study staff were blinded throughout the
study. The study protocols conformed to the ethical guidelines of

the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice and were
approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital
District of Tampere. Informed consent was obtained from each
child’s parents or legal guardians before study start.
Year 1: First and Second Dose
In the ﬁrst study, subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1
ratio to receive 1 of 2 trivalent inactivated inﬂuenza vaccines: a
subunit vaccine adjuvanted with MF59 (Sub/MF59, Fluad, Novartis
Vaccines) or a licensed nonadjuvanted split vaccine (Vaxigrip, sanoﬁ
pasteur). Randomization was stratiﬁed according to age (6–11 months,
12–17 months, 18–23 months, 24–29 months, 30–35 months). Two
0.25 mL vaccine doses were given 4 weeks apart, administered
intramuscularly in the deltoid region of the nondominant arm, or in
the anterolateral aspect of the thigh, if the deltoid mass was insufﬁ-
cient. Both vaccines contained 7.5 g per 0.25 mL of each of the 3
inﬂuenza antigens recommended by the World Health Organization
for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during the 2006–2007 inﬂuenza
season: A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like virus, A/Wisconsin/67/
2005 (H3N2)-like virus, B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like virus. Both vac-
cines were provided in 0.5 mL preﬁlled syringes with a pediatric ring
for the administration of half of the adult dose (0.25 mL). The
Sub/MF59 inﬂuenza vaccine contained 9.75 mg of squalene as adju-
vant per 0.5 mL.
Year 2: Booster Dose
In the extension study, children who had received both vaccine
doses received a third dose of the respective vaccine, approximately 1
year after the ﬁrst dose. For the 2007–2008 NH season, only the
recommendation for the A/H1N1-like strain (A/Solomon Islands/3/
2006) changed compared with year 1 of this study. In this report, we
will use the term “booster dose” to refer to this year 2 vaccination. The
booster dose was administered as a single intramuscular dose of 0.25
mL in children aged less than 36 months or 0.5 mL in those aged 36
months or older.
Study Assessments
Immunogenicity
In the unprimed children, blood samples were obtained
before vaccination (day 0), 4 weeks after the ﬁrst vaccine dose
(day 29), 3 weeks after the second dose (day 50), and at the end of
6 months’ follow-up (day 209). Further samples were taken in the
extension study prior to (year 2, day 0) and 3 weeks after (year 2,
day 21) the booster dose. Immunogenicity was analyzed for the per
protocol population, deﬁned as all children who received all the
doses of vaccine correctly, provided evaluable serum samples at all
scheduled time points, and had no major protocol violations.
Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers were measured as
described previously,17 against each of the 3 inﬂuenza strains in
the 2006–2007 and 2007–2008 vaccine formulations, respectively.
Results were expressed as geometric mean titers (GMTs) with
95% conﬁdence intervals (CI); geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of
post- to prevaccination titer; seroprotection rates, deﬁned as the
percentage of subjects achieving an HI titer 40; and seroconver-
sion rates, deﬁned as the percentage of subjects achieving at least
a 4-fold increase in HI titer from a seropositive prevaccination titer
(10) or a rise from 10 to 40 in those who were seronegative.
In a poststudy immunogenicity analysis, sera collected during
the primary trial (2006–2007) were also tested against mismatched
A/H3N2 (A/New York/55/2004-like strain) and B (Jiangsu/10/2003-
like strain) recommended for 2005–2006 NH vaccination campaign,
and against the A/H1N1 strain (A/Solomon Islands/3/2006-like) that
emerged during subsequent inﬂuenza season (2007–2008), to assess
the immune response induced against vaccine mismatched viruses.
Clinical Tolerability and Safety
Safety was assessed for all subjects who received at least 1
dose of vaccine and had post-baseline safety data. Immediately
after each vaccination and for the following 7 days, parents/legal
guardians recorded solicited local and systemic reactions on diary
cards. Solicited reactions varied according to the age of the
subject. As it was conducted 1 year later, the extension study also
included older children (36 months of age), for whom different
criteria were used to assess tolerability in comparison with the
earlier initial tolerability assessments. For children 36 months of
age, systemic reactions were largely based on behaviors (eg, irritabil-
ity, unusual crying, sleepiness, change in eating habits, vomiting, and
diarrhea). Other systemic reactions (eg, chills, malaise, myalgia,
arthralgia, headache, and fatigue) were solicited from older chil-
dren (36 months of age) who were better able to express
themselves. Similarly, solicited local reactions included ecchymo-
sis, erythema, induration and swelling for all subjects, and either
tenderness (children 36 months of age) or pain (children 36
months of age in the extension study) at the injection site. Body
temperature, use of analgesic/antipyretic medication and any other
adverse events (AEs) were registered for all subjects. All AEs were
recorded from study start up to 3 weeks after the last vaccine
injection. All serious AEs (SAEs) and AEs necessitating physician
consultation, or leading to premature study discontinuation, were
recorded throughout the studies.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using SAS (SAS Institute; version 9.1
or higher, Cary, NC). The 2 test was performed to analyze
differences between proportions of subjects. Statistical signiﬁ-
cance between pre- and postvaccination titers was assessed using
a paired Student t test. Different vaccine groups were compared
using the Student t test for unpaired data. A P  0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.
RESULTS
Study Population
Year 1: First and Second Dose
In the primary trial, 281 children were enrolled and ran-
domized and 269 received at least 1 dose of vaccine: 130 in the
Sub/MF59 group and 139 in the split group (Figure, Supplemental
Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/A1127). Of these, 222
subjects completed the initial study, had sufﬁcient blood samples
for analysis, and were included in the immunogenicity analysis:
104 in the Sub/MF59 vaccine group and 118 in the split vaccine
group. Demographic characteristics and age distributions were
well matched between the groups (Table, Supplemental Digital
Content 2, http://links.lww.com/A1128).
Year 2: Booster Dose
Parents of all children who completed the primary study
were invited to have their children take part in the extension study
1 year later. After screening, only 89 children were eligible: 43 in
the Sub/MF59 group and 46 in the split group (Figure, Supple-
mental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/A1127). Most of
the screening failures resulted from children having already re-
ceived an inﬂuenza vaccine for that season outside of the study, in
agreement with the new recommendation issued for the 2007–
2008 season in Finland. Of the revaccinated children, 81 subjects
were included in the immunogenicity analysis: 41 in the Sub/
MF59 vaccine group and 40 in the split vaccine group. The other
8 subjects were excluded from analysis because of a missing blood

sample for at least 1 visit or because they had received the wrong
vaccine dose for their age.
Safety
Year 1: First and Second Dose
Diary cards for local and systemic reactions and AE reports
were collected from all 269 children enrolled in the ﬁrst study.
Solicited local and systemic reactions reported during 1 week after
each of the ﬁrst 2 doses are presented in Table 1. Reactions were
typically mild or moderate and transient (subsiding within 2–3
days after vaccination). There were no signiﬁcant differences in
local and systemic reactions between the 2 vaccine groups, with
the exception of injection site swelling, where there were more
reports of mild or moderate swelling with Sub/MF59 (12%) than
with the split vaccine (5%, P  0.033). In general, both local and
systemic reactions were reduced after the second vaccine dose
compared with the ﬁrst vaccination.
Twenty-one children in each group had an AE assessed as
possibly or probably vaccine-related from the study start to the end
of the 6-months follow-up. Two children in each group were
withdrawn from the trial because of an AE (1 case of petecchiae
and 1 case of urticaria in the Sub/MF59 group; 1 case of asthma
and 1 case of upper respiratory infection in the split group). Two
SAEs (both cases of pneumonia) were reported during the fol-
low-up period in the Sub/MF59 group. The ﬁrst case occurred in
a 3-year-old girl, pneumonia led to hospitalization, with a rapid
improvement of the health conditions after antibiotic treatment; the
child was discharged after 3 days. The second case occurred in a
14-month-old boy and it was a case of Respiratory syncytial virus
pneumonia. Six SAEs were reported in the split group (2 cases of
prolonged bronchitis, 2 cases of gastroenteritis, 1 case of otitis
media, and 1 case of asthma). None of these events was judged to
be vaccine related.
Year 2: Booster Dose
After the booster injection, overall solicited reactions were
slightly more frequent in the Sub/MF59 group compared with the
nonadjuvanted split group (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 3,
http://links.lww.com/A1129). Although not statistically signiﬁ-
cant, there was a trend toward an increased incidence of reactions
in children aged 36 months, evident for both vaccine groups. The
incidence of local and systemic reactions was similar to that
observed during the ﬁrst year and was generally comparable
between vaccine groups. In the older age group (36 months), 12
of 18 children (67%) receiving the Sub/MF59 vaccine had pain at
the injection site, compared with 6 of 23 children (26%, P 
0.001) receiving the split vaccine. Only 1 subject in the Sub/MF59
group reported severe pain.
Immunogenicity
Year 1: First and Second Dose
Serologic analysis was performed on the 222 subjects who
completed the full vaccination schedule in year 1 and had all 4 sera
drawn (n  104, Sub/MF59 group; n  118, split group). Baseline
GMTs were well balanced between vaccine groups (Table 2). In
each age and vaccine group, GMTs against H3N2 were signiﬁ-
cantly higher than those against H1N1, which in turn were signif-
icantly higher than those against inﬂuenza B. Responses to H3N2
and H1N1 were similar across the age groups, but there was an
apparent age dependence in the response to the B strain in the split
vaccine, with very low responses in the youngest children. In
contrast, the Sub/MF59 group showed similarly high responses
across all age ranges tested (Fig. 1).
Overall, postvaccination GMTs and GMRs were signiﬁ-
cantly higher with Sub/MF59 than with the split vaccine for all 3
vaccine virus strains (all comparisons P  0.001).
In the total study population, both vaccines elicited compa-
rably high seroprotection rates for A/H3N2 (100% Sub/MF59 vs.
99% split), but Sub/MF59 elicited a signiﬁcantly higher seropro-
tection rate for A/H1N1 (100% vs. 86% split P  0.001) after the
recommended 2 doses for this age group (Table 2). After a single
dose, signiﬁcantly greater proportion of the Sub/MF59 group
achieved seroprotection (A/H3N2: 91% vs. 49% split P  0.001
and A/H1N1: 51% vs. 18% split P  0.001). Antibody responses
to inﬂuenza B remained low after a single dose in both vaccine
groups; however, after 2 doses, 99% of subjects in the Sub/MF59
group had seroprotective levels of HI antibody compared with only
33% of subjects in the split vaccine group (P  0.001; Table 2). In
children 6 to 11 months of age, the difference was even more
pronounced, with 100% of children in the Sub/MF59 group
achieving seroprotection compared with 12% of those in the split
vaccine group (P  0.001; Fig. 2). A similar pattern of results was

seen for seroconversion rates, with statistically signiﬁcant differ-
ences (P  0.001) in favor of Sub/MF59 vaccine achieved against
both A strains after ﬁrst dose, and against A/H1N1 and B strains
after second vaccine dose (Fig., Supplemental Digital Content 4,
http://links.lww.com/A1130).
All HI antibody titers declined over the follow-up period,
but consistently remained signiﬁcantly higher in the Sub/MF59
group than in the split group. After 6 months, seroprotection rates
were 100% and 66% for H3N2, 48% and 20% for H1N1, and 22%
and 3% for B strains, for the Sub/MF59 and split vaccines,
respectively (P  0.001 for all comparisons). After approximately
1 year, subjects in the Sub/MF59 group maintained HI titers that
were higher than those in the split vaccine group for all strains
examined (Table 2). The difference was particularly evident for
seroprotection rates against A/H3N2 (Sub/MF59 88% vs. split
40%, P  0.001). HI titers against the B strain were low in both
vaccine groups (GMT: 9.9 for the Sub/MF59 group and 5.1 for the
split vaccine group).
Year 1: Immune Response to Vaccine Mismatched Strains
For both vaccine groups, prevaccination GMTs and sero-
protection rates were higher for the mismatched A/H3N2 virus
strain than for mismatched A/H1N1 and B strains. Signiﬁcantly
higher postvaccination GMTs were recorded in the Sub/MF59
group, compared with the split vaccine group for all 3 mismatched
strains tested (Table 3). In the Sub/MF59 group, increased post-
vaccination seroprotection (Fig. 3) and seroconversion (data not
shown) rates were attained against both mismatched inﬂuenza A
strains, but not against the B strain. However, the seroprotection
rate against the mismatched B strain was statistically higher in the
Sub/MF59 group than the split vaccine group (P  0.001).
Year 2: Booster Dose
Twenty-one days after the year 2 booster dose, immune
responses in the Sub/MF59 group were consistently higher than
those observed in the split vaccine group (Table 2). Seroprotection
rates of 100% were achieved by both vaccines against both
inﬂuenza A strains; however, only the Sub/MF59 vaccine resulted
in 100% seroprotection against inﬂuenza B, compared with 68%
seroprotection with the split vaccine (P  0.001). The same trend
was observed for seroconversion.
Seroprotection and seroconversion rates in children aged
36 months were generally similar to those in the older age group;
lower rates were only seen in this age cohort for the B strain in the
split vaccine group (45% vs. 90% for both seroprotection and
seroconversion in children aged 36 months and children aged
36 months, respectively). In the Sub/MF59 group, GMRs were
also similar between the 2 age cohorts (17 and 18 against H3N2,
122 and 63 against H1N1, and 19 and 17 against the B strain in
children aged 36 months and children aged 36 months, respec-
tively). In contrast, in the split vaccine group, GMRs were lower
in the younger age group (8 and 19 against H3N2, 43 and 64
against H1N1, 4 and 16 against the B strain in children aged 36
months and children aged 36 months, respectively).
DISCUSSION
This is the ﬁrst study of MF59-adjuvanted subunit inﬂuenza
vaccine in young children. In previous trials, MF59-adjuvanted
inﬂuenza vaccine has shown a good safety and tolerability proﬁle
in other populations.9,18 In the present study, among 269 children
less than 36 months of age, the Sub/MF59 vaccine resulted in slightly
higher local reactogenicity, but similar systemic reactogenicity, com-
pared with a conventional inﬂuenza vaccine. Both vaccines showed
comparable safety proﬁles following the booster dose administered 1
year after the ﬁrst dose. Furthermore, the MF59 adjuvant demon-
strated that it can signiﬁcantly increase the immune response in young
children against all seasonal inﬂuenza subtypes. Sub/MF59 vaccine
resulted in higher HI antibody titers compared with the split vaccine
across all 3 vaccine virus strains and across all age subgroups in
unprimed children aged 6 months to 36 months. The adjuvanted
vaccine was also more immunogenic than the split vaccine when
given as a booster dose approximately 1 year after priming.
This relatively small-sized study suggest that, considering
similar systemic reactogenicity, the substantially increased immuno-
genicity even in the youngest age groups, and the relating anticipated
clinical beneﬁts should outweigh the small increase in generally mild-

and transient-solicited local reactions with the Sub/MF59 vaccine in
this vulnerable population. However, more data on reactogenicity and
safety of MF59-adjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccine in young children need
to be collected.
The United States and some European Union countries
(speciﬁcally Finland since 2007) have recommended seasonal
inﬂuenza vaccination for children, especially the very young,
based on evidence of the health impact in this age group. Morbid-
ity and hospitalization rates for children less than 5 years of age are
similar to those observed in the elderly.19,20 Criteria are estab-
lished for the evaluation of inﬂuenza vaccines for healthy adults
and the elderly,21 but there are currently no such criteria for
children and infants, as data on vaccine efﬁcacy in young children
remain limited. For example, 1 study has shown over 80% efﬁcacy
against a homologous H3N2 strain.22 In contrast, a recent Co-
chrane analysis implies that inﬂuenza vaccines have limited ﬁeld
efﬁcacy in young children.6 Recently, intranasally administered
live attenuated trivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (LAIV) showed 72.9%
to 88.7% efﬁcacy in children compared with placebo.23,24 In a
large ﬁeld trial, LAIV showed 79.2% and 89.2% greater efﬁcacy
than trivalent inactivated vaccine against H3N2 and H1N1, respec-
tively.25 Since LAIV is not licensed for children below 2 years,
and safety issues limit the use of LAIV to children over 2 years of
age with no history of wheezing, an effective alternative is still
needed for children younger than this age.25
In practice, despite the recommendations, young children
often receive only 1 injection of inﬂuenza vaccine in each sea-
son.26 This study indicates that a single dose of a nonadjuvanted
vaccine is not sufﬁcient to induce protective immunity to H3N2,
H1N1, or B strains in unprimed children less than 36 months of
age. For H3N2, MF59-adjuvanted vaccine yielded high seropro-
tection rates (91%) even after 1 dose. Therefore, against this most
common causative strain of inﬂuenza, even a single dose of
MF59-adjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccine, but not of the nonadjuvanted
vaccine, might be expected to provide a good level of protection.
Altogether, the protective efﬁcacy of an inﬂuenza vaccine would
depend on the relative proportions of H3N2, H1N1, and B strains
in a given season. With higher proportions of H1N1 and B strains
in the season, the advantage of MF59 adjuvanted vaccine over
nonadjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccines (after 1 and particularly after 2
doses) is likely to be greatest.
Altogether, the protective efﬁcacy of an inﬂuenza vaccine in
young children with vaccine-induced immunity only may be ex-
pected to correlate with the prevalence of seroprotective level of
HI antibody titers at the time of the inﬂuenza epidemic season. The
present study showed that, after a postdose 2, HI antibody levels
declined for both vaccines and all inﬂuenza strains. However, it is
noteworthy to mention that Sub/MF59 vaccine recipients had a
particularly durable response against the H3N2 vaccine strain, with
88% (vs. 40% in the split vaccine group) of the subjects retaining
seroprotective levels of HI antibodies for approximately 1 year.
Active follow-up of inﬂuenza was not conducted in the
subjects participating to this study. It is possible that some of the
vaccinated children may have been exposed to wild-type inﬂuenza
during the epidemic season and such exposures may have boosted
inﬂuenza antibody levels, resulting in an apparent increase in
persistence of seroprotective levels of HI antibodies. Should that
have happened, the effect might, however, have been greater in the
recipients of split vaccine. In fact, these children had lower
antibody levels after vaccination and were presumably more sus-
ceptible to wild-type inﬂuenza. Therefore, exposure to wild-type
inﬂuenza might only have narrowed the gap in seroprotective
levels of HI antibodies between the 2 groups, which, however,
remained wide in favor of the Sub/MF59 group.
Previous studies have shown that the immunogenicity of
inﬂuenza B virus is lower than the immunogenicity of the inﬂu-
enza A strains contained in vaccines.27,28 In ﬁeld conditions, the
inﬂuenza B strain accounts for a substantial proportion of cases
regardless of season.29 In the present study, MF59 improved
immunogenicity against the B vaccine virus, whereas the nonad-
juvanted vaccine induced only low immune responses. This was
particularly evident in the younger age groups (24 months)
where seroprotection in the Sub/MF59 group was 98% compared
with 28% in the split vaccine group (P  0.001). Even after the
second-year booster dose, seroprotection against the B strain in
younger children remained less than 50% in the split vaccine
group, compared with 100% in the Sub/MF59 group.
Antigenic drift of inﬂuenza viruses requires frequent adap-
tation of vaccine strains to accommodate this drift. Predicting
additional drift in advance of the inﬂuenza season remains one of
the major challenges to successful vaccination, and the negative
impact of vaccine mismatch on vaccine effectiveness and spread in
the community is well established.7,30–32 In a multiyear study
evaluating vaccine effectiveness versus the antigenic distance of
strain mismatches in the vaccine, a strong correlation was obtained
between antigenic distance and vaccine effectiveness.33 The ability
of an inﬂuenza vaccine to evoke an immune response against
drifted viruses that are different from those included in the formu-
lation would be of major clinical value, especially in very young
children who are often naive to inﬂuenza virus exposure. In our
study, Sub/MF59 induced signiﬁcantly higher immune responses
against mismatched A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains than the licensed
split vaccine. Higher cross-reactivity was found against the A/H3N2
antigen, conﬁrming previous results in other populations.12–14 In
contrast, no cross-reactivity against the mismatched B strain was
detected in either vaccine group, as the mismatched B strain selected
for the analysis was of a different lineage (B/Yamagata) than the
vaccine strain (B/Victoria). Since the early 1980s, 2 distinct lineages

of B inﬂuenza strains have cocirculated in humans, with frequent
differences in the predominant lineage circulating at a given time in a
given geographic region.34 Since there is no cross-reactivity between
the 2 B lineages, public health experts have considered the need to
include both B lineages into vaccines to ensure adequate antigenic
coverage.35
Taken together, the results of this study indicate that MF59-
adjuvanted vaccine has acceptable tolerability and greater immu-
nogenicity in young children compared with the conventional split
vaccine. Based on these results, expanded studies of MF59-
adjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccine in young infants, including efﬁcacy
trials, are warranted.
