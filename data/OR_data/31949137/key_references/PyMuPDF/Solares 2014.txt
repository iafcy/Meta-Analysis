Abstract 
Introduction: The efficacy of non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine in young children is considered to be suboptimal.  This study 
compared the safety and immunogenicity profiles of MF59-adjuvanted, trivalent, influenza vaccine (ATIV) and non-adjuvanted, trivalent, 
influenza vaccine (TIV) in Guatemalan children (N = 360) between 6 and < 60 months of age. 
Methodology: Children received two doses of ATIV or TIV administered four weeks apart. Solicited adverse reactions were recorded for 
seven days after each vaccination. Serious adverse events were recorded throughout the entire study period. Antibody responses were 
assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay at baseline, four weeks after administration of the first vaccine dose, and three weeks after 
administration of the second dose. 
Results: Both ATIV and TIV were well tolerated, with similar rates of solicited reactions and adverse events observed in response to both 
vaccines. MF59-adjuvanted vaccine induced considerably higher antibody titers than did TIV. After two doses, the B strain-specific antibody 
response to TIV was insufficient to meet the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) licensure criterion for seroprotection, 
whereas responses to the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine met the seroprotection criterion against all three strains. Cross-reactive antibody 
responses to MF59-adjuvanted vaccine met the CBER seroprotection criterion against all three strains after two doses; B strain-specific 
heterologous responses to non-adjuvanted TIV were inadequate. 
Conclusions: The MF59-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine was well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in children 6 to < 60 months of 
age, inducing seroprotective antibody titers against both the vaccine strains and antigenically distinct heterologous strains.

Introduction 
Young children and infants have the highest rates 
of seasonal influenza disease and are at increased risk 
of hospitalization for influenza-related conditions 
[1,2]. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated high 
rates 
of 
influenza-related 
hospitalizations 
and 
outpatient visits in the pediatric population [3,4]. 
Children play a major role in the spread of influenza 
disease within communities [5,6]. Immunization of 
children against influenza not only protects the 
individual, but inhibits viral transmission among the 
wider population [7,8]. Therefore, safe and effective 
vaccines for the pediatric population are essential to 
minimize the socio-economic impact of seasonal 
influenza disease. 
Following the lead of the United States (US) [9], 
routine vaccination against seasonal influenza in 
children from six months of age is increasingly being 
recommended by health authorities in other countries 
[10]. However, the efficacy of non-adjuvanted, 
trivalent influenza vaccines (TIV) in young and 
unprimed children is inadequate. Meta-analyses have 
shown the efficacy of non-adjuvanted TIV to be as 
low as 59% in children above two years of age, and to 
be unproven in children under two years of age 
[11,12]. The immunogenicity of non-adjuvanted TIV 
is particularly poor against B strain influenza virus 
[13,14]. 
Vaccine adjuvants, such as MF59 (Novartis 
Vaccines and Diagnostics), serve to potentiate the

immunogenicity of vaccines, and offer a solution to 
the suboptimal antibody titers observed in response to 
non-adjuvanted TIV in the pediatric population. As 
well as decreasing required antigen content per dose 
and promoting long-term antibody persistence [15], 
MF59 has been shown to enhance levels of 
heterologous immunity by heightening cross-reactive 
antibody responses in vaccinees of all ages [16-23]. 
The good safety profile of MF59-adjuvanted influenza 
vaccines is well established [24-27]. 
In order to evaluate the possible benefits of 
adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine in children 
under five years of age compared with non-adjuvanted 
vaccine, 
this 
study 
assessed 
the 
safety 
and 
immunogenicity profiles of ATIV compared with non-
adjuvanted, split TIV in healthy Guatemalan children. 
Vaccine antigen-specific (homologous) and cross-
reactive (heterologous) antibody responses were 
analyzed after first and second vaccine doses by 
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay according to 
the US Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research 
(CBER) licensure criteria for seasonal influenza 
vaccines [28]. 
 
Methodology 
Study design and objectives 
This phase II, randomized, multicenter, observer-
blind study was conducted across five sites in 
Guatemala between January and October 2008. The 
study protocol was approved by an independent 
Guatamalan ethics committee, and the study was 
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Before 
enrolment, written informed consent was obtained for 
all subjects from their parents or legal guardians. The 
primary objective of this study was to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of one and two doses of either 
ATIV or TIV in children under three years of age. The 
secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the 
immunogenicity of one and two doses of either ATIV 
or TIV by HI assay in children under five years of age. 
Subjects were randomly assigned in equal numbers to 
receive two doses of either ATIV or TIV. Children  36 
to < 60 months of  age group were enrolled first; 
enrolment of children 6 to < 36 months of age began 
only after the reactogenicity data for the older children 
had been found to be acceptable by an independent 
safety data monitoring committee. Vaccines were 
prepared and administered by designated, non-blinded 
study personnel who did not participate in the 
evaluation of data. Blood samples (5 mL) were 
obtained by venipuncture for immunogenicity analysis 
at baseline (day 1), four weeks after administration of 
the first vaccine dose (day 29), and three weeks after 
the second vaccine dose (day 50). 
 
Subjects 
A total of 360 healthy children from 6 to < 60 
months of age were enrolled in the study (Figure 1). 
Exclusion criteria were: any serious illness; history or 
likelihood of anaphylaxis or adverse reaction to any 
vaccine component; known or suspected impairment 
of the immune system; history of Guillain-Barré 
syndrome or bleeding diathesis; receipt of inactivated 
or live vaccine two and four weeks prior to enrolment, 
respectively; receipt of influenza vaccine six months 
prior to enrolment; laboratory-confirmed influenza 
disease six months prior to enrolment; receipt of any 
investigational agent 90 days prior to enrolment; 
previous receipt of two doses of influenza vaccine, 
either in a single previous influenza season or two 
previous consecutive seasons; a rectal temperature ≥ 
38C; and acute illness within the three days prior to 
enrolment. 
 
Vaccines 
The MF59-adjuvanted, egg-derived, seasonal, 
trivalent 
influenza 
vaccine 
(ATIV) 
contained 
hemagglutinin (HA) surface antigen from each of the 
three 
World 
Health 
Organization 
(WHO) 
recommended influenza strains for the 20072008 
season in the northern hemisphere: A/Solomon 
Islands/3/2006 
(H1N1), 
A/Wisconsin/67/2005 
(H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004. Children  6 to < 
36 months of age received ATIV in a volume of 0.25 
mL per dose. A 0.25 mL dose of ATIV contained 7.5

µg of HA antigen from each of the three strains (total 
22.5 µg antigen per dose) and half the standard dose of 
MF59 (4.88 mg squalene). Children  36 to < 60 
months of age received ATIV in a volume of 0.50 mL 
per dose. A 0.50 mL dose of ATIV contained 15 µg of 
HA antigen from each of the three strains (total 45.0 
µg antigen per dose) and a standard dose of MF59 
(9.75 mg squalene). The antigen content of the non-
adjuvanted, seasonal, trivalent influenza vaccine 
(TIV), US licensed Fluzone (Sanofi Pasteur Inc., One 
Discovery Drive, Software, PA 18370), was identical 
to the ATIV in terms of quantities and viral strains. 
Children 6 to < 36 months of age received TIV in a 
volume of 0.25 mL per dose (total 22.5 µg antigen per 
dose). Children 36 to < 60 months of age received TIV 
in a volume of 0.50 mL per dose (total 45.0 µg antigen 
per dose). All vaccines were supplied in monodose 
(0.50 mL), and the pre-filled syringes containing the 
0.5 mL dose were provided with a pediatric line for 
administering the 0.25 mL dose. The vaccine was 
administered in the deltoid muscle of the non-
dominant arm, or the anterolateral aspect of the thigh 
if deltoid muscle mass was insufficient. 
 
Safety analyses 
All subjects were monitored for ~30 minutes after 
vaccination for possible immediate adverse reactions. 
Solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were 
recorded on diary cards for seven consecutive days 
following first and second dose vaccinations by the 
subjects’ parents or legal guardians. Unsolicited 
adverse events (AEs) were recorded from study days 
150. Serious adverse events (SAEs), medically 
attended visits, and AEs leading to withdrawal were 
recorded throughout the entire study period (days 
1211). All SAEs were immediately reported to the 
study sponsor. Solicited local adverse reactions were 
ecchymosis, erythema, induration, swelling, and pain 
(defined as tenderness or pain at injection site in 
children 6 to < 36 months age and 36 to < 60 months 
of age, respectively). In children 6 to < 36 months of 
age, solicited systemic adverse reactions were 
sleepiness, diarrhea, vomiting, irritability, altered 
eating habits, shivering, and unusual crying. In 
children 36 to < 60 months of age, solicited systemic 
adverse reactions were chills, malaise, myalgia, 
arthralgia, headache, sweating, and fatigue. Other 
solicited indicators of reactogenicity were fever (≥ 
38C), severe fever (≥ 40C), the use of analgesic or 
antipyretic medication, and the decision to stay at 
home due to adverse reactions. AEs were classified as 
mild, moderate, or severe if they resulted in no 
limitation of, some limitation of, or an inability to 
perform normal daily activities, respectively. AEs 
were judged to be either non-related, possibly related, 
or probably related to vaccination by the investigator. 
 
Immunogenicity analyses 
Blood samples were centrifuged, and sera were 
stored at -18°C until being shipped to the Novartis 
Vaccines Clinical Serology Laboratory in Marburg, 
Germany, for analysis. Antibody responses to 
vaccination were measured by HI assay, according to 
standard methods [29]. HI titer was expressed as the 
reciprocal 
of 
the 
highest 
dilution 
at 
which 
hemagglutination was totally inhibited. Homologous 
antibody responses were tested against the vaccine 
antigen strains A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), 
A/Wisconsin/67/2005 
(H3N2), 
and 
B/Malaysia/2506/2004. Cross-reactive (heterologous) 
antibody responses were tested against influenza 
strains 
A/Brisbane/59/2007 
(H1N1), 
A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2), and B/Florida/4/2006. 
For subjects seronegative (HI titer < 10) at baseline, 
seroconversion was defined as a pre-vaccination HI 
titer < 10 to a post-vaccination titer ≥ 40. For subjects 
seropositive (HI titer ≥ 10) at baseline, seroconversion 
was defined as a ≥ fourfold increase in HI titer 
following vaccination. HI titers below the detection 
limit of 1:10 were arbitrarily assigned to half that limit 
(1:5) for the purpose of analysis. Per protocol set 
(PPS) immunogenicity data are reported throughout. 
 
Statistical analyses 
No formal statistical hypothesis was tested. 
Sample sizes were chosen to provide adequate 
estimates for immunogenicity endpoints based on 
CBER licensure criteria [28], assuming a 10% dropout 
rate. The CBER criterion for seroconversion was that 
the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the percentage of subjects achieving 
seroconversion for HI antibody should be ≤ 40%. The 
CBER criterion for seroprotection was that the lower 
bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of 
subjects achieving an HI antibody titer ≥ 40 should be 
≤ 70%. Geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs), and 
geometric 
mean 
ratios 
(GMRs) 
as 
well 
as 
corresponding two-sided 95% CIs were calculated for 
each vaccine group. Log10-transformed antibody titers 
were modeled using analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
for each strain with vaccine groups and study centers 
as factors. Safety data were evaluated descriptively 
and expressed as the numbers and percentages of 
subjects experiencing AEs in each vaccination group.

Statistical analyses were performed by the Statistics 
Department of Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 
using SAS 9.1 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, 
USA). 
 
Results 
Across age and vaccination groups, 89%96% of 
subjects completed the study on day 211 (Figure 1). 
The reasons for subjects not completing the study were 
withdrawal of consent (n = 12), subjects being lost to 
follow-up (n = 18), AE (n = 2), and non-vaccine-
related death (n = 1). The baseline demographics of 
the enrolled study population are presented in Table 1. 
Groups were similar with respect to subjects’ weights, 
heights, and ethnicities within the 6 to < 36 month-old 
and 36 to < 60 month-old age groups. 
 
Safety analyses 
In the 6 to < 36 month-old age group, rates of 
solicited adverse reactions were slightly higher in 
subjects who received ATIV compared with subjects 
who received TIV. The majority of reactions were 
mild in severity and transient in nature. Local adverse 
reactions were experienced by 32% and 24% of ATIV 
vaccinees, and by 29% and 17% of TIV vaccinees 
after first and second doses, respectively. The most 
commonly reported solicited local adverse reactions in 
both ATIV and TIV groups were pain at the site of 
injection and erythema (Table 2). No subjects 
experienced severe local adverse reactions. Systemic 
adverse reactions were experienced by 28% and 22% 
of ATIV vaccinees, and by 25% and 21% of TIV 
vaccinees after first and second doses, respectively. 
The most commonly reported solicited systemic 
adverse reaction in both ATIV and TIV groups was 
unusual crying (Table 2). Fever (≥ 38C) was reported 
in 32% and 23% of subjects in the ATIV and TIV 
groups, respectively. No subjects experienced severe 
fever (≥ 40C) at any time during the study. 
In the 36 to < 60 month-old age group, rates of 
solicited local adverse reactions were generally higher 
in subjects who received ATIV compared with those 
who received TIV. The majority of reactions were 
mild in severity and transient in nature. Local adverse 
reactions were experienced by 60% and 54% of ATIV 
vaccinees, and by 46% and 45% of TIV vaccinees 
after first and second doses, respectively. Pain at the 
site of injection and erythema were the most 
commonly reported local adverse reactions (Table 3). 
Rates of systemic adverse reactions were similar in the 
ATIV and TIV groups; systemic adverse reactions 
were experienced by 34% and 23% of ATIV 
vaccinees, and by 32% and 21% of TIV vaccinees 
after first and second doses, respectively. Malaise and 
headache were the most commonly reported systemic 
reactions (Table 3). One subject in the ATIV group 
and one subject in the TIV group experienced severe 
malaise. Rates of fever (≥ 38C) were similar in the 
ATIV (18%) and TIV (22%) groups. Severe fever (≥ 
40C) was experienced by one subject in the TIV 
group after the first vaccine dose. 
Rates of AEs were similar between ATIV and TIV 
groups. Between study days 150, AEs were reported 
by 36%42% of 6 to < 36 month-old children, and by 
36%48% of 36 to < 60 month-old children; 2%4% 
of these events were considered to be at least possibly 
related to vaccination. The most commonly reported 
AEs among all subjects by preferred term were 
nasopharyngitis (5%7% across ATIV and TIV 
groups), upper respiratory tract infection (6%7% 
across both groups), and cough (6%). During the 
primary study period (days 150), one 36 to < 60 
month-old ATIV vaccinee and one 36 to < 60 month-
old TIV vaccinee experienced non-vaccine-related 
AEs (both varicella-zoster infection), leading to 
withdrawal from the study. No SAEs were reported 
during the primary study period. Two non-vaccine-
related SAEs were reported during the six-month 
safety follow-up period (days 50211): one 11-month-
old female TIV vaccinee died due to falling down 
stairs, and one 18-month-old male ATIV vaccinee was 
hospitalized due to lobar pneumonia. 
 
Immunogenicity analyses 
In the 6 to < 36 month-old age group, MF59-
adjuvanted vaccine consistently induced higher 
homologous GMTs (Figure 2) and higher GMRs 
(Table 4) than did non-adjuvanted TIV after first (day 
29) and second (day 50) doses. In the 36 to < 60 
month-old age group, first and second MF59-
adjuvanted vaccine doses induced higher homologous 
GMTs (Figure 2) than did non-adjuvanted TIV against 
A/H1N1 and B strains, but not against A/H3N2; 
GMRs were consistently higher in response to MF59-
adjuvanted vaccine after both first and second doses 
(Table 4). For both age groups, antibody responses to 
one dose of ATIV and TIV were sufficiently high 
against A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains to meet the 
CBER licensure criteria for seroconversion (Table 4) 
and seroprotection (Figure 3); seroconversion and 
seroprotection criteria were not met after one dose of 
ATIV or TIV against the B strain.

After the second vaccine dose, the seroconversion 
criterion was met in response to ATIV and TIV 
against all three strains (Table 4) in both age groups. 
The seroprotection criterion was met against all three 
strains after two doses of ATIV in both age groups; 
two doses of TIV consistently failed to meet the 
seroprotection criterion against the B strain (Figure 3). 
Combined analysis for both age groups (6 to < 60 
months) found that two doses of ATIV met the CBER 
licensure 
criteria 
for 
seroconversion 
and 
seroprotection against all three strains, whereas TIV 
failed to meet the seroprotection criterion against the B 
strain (data not shown). 
Sera were analyzed by HI assay for the presence of 
vaccine-induced antibody able to cross-react with the 
non-vaccine strains A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), 
A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2), and B/Florida/4/2006. 
Heterologous GMTs and GMRs were consistently 
higher in response to first and second doses of MF59-
adjuvanted vaccine than to non-adjuvanted vaccine in 
both age groups, apart from anti-H3N2 responses, 
which were equal or higher in response to TIV for 
children 36 to < 60 months of age (Table 5). In 
children 6 to < 36 months of age, one dose of MF59-
adjuvanted vaccine was sufficient to meet the 
licensure criterion for seroconversion against the 
A/H3N2 strain; one dose of non-adjuvanted TIV failed 
to meet this criterion. One dose of ATIV and TIV met 
the seroconversion criteria against both A strains in 
children 36 to < 60 months of age. Two doses of 
MF59-adjuvanted vaccine met the seroconversion 
criterion against all three strains in both age groups; 
two doses of non-adjuvanted TIV failed to meet the 
seroconversion criterion against the B strain in both 
age groups. The CBER criterion for seroprotection 
was met after one dose of ATIV and TIV against the 
A/H1N1 strain in children 6 to < 36 months of age, 
and against both A strains in children 36 to < 60 
months of age. Two doses of MF59-adjuvanted 
vaccine met the seroprotection criterion against all 
three vaccine strains in children 6 to < 36 months of 
age; 
non-adjuvanted 
TIV 
failed 
to 
meet 
the 
seroprotection criterion against the B strain. In 
children 36 to < 60 months of age, two doses of ATIV 
and TIV met the seroprotection criterion against both 
A strains, but not against the B strain.

Discussion 
Due to being immunologically naive for influenza 
antigens, the pediatric population is affected by 
particularly high rates of seasonal influenza disease 
and high rates of influenza-associated hospitalization 
[1-4]. Non-adjuvanted, seasonal TIVs do not induce 
adequate levels of seroprotection against influenza 
disease in unprimed young children [11,12]. Vaccine 
adjuvants offer a solution to the suboptimal antibody 
titers observed in response to non-adjuvanted TIV in 
the pediatric population. A recent study of the MF59-
adjuvanted, trivalent influenza study vaccine (ATIV), 
Fluad, in 4,707 previously unvaccinated healthy 
children 6 to < 72 months of age, demonstrated ATIV 
to be 98% efficacious in preventing influenza disease, 
while non-adjuvanted TIV had a vaccine efficacy of 
only 45% [30]. The present study was conducted to 
assess vaccine safety and to determine whether 
immunization 
with 
MF59-adjuvanted 
trivalent 
influenza vaccine resulted in increased levels of 
homologous 
and 
heterologous 
seroprotection 
compared with a licensed, non-adjuvanted TIV. 
Both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines 
were generally well-tolerated in both age cohorts. 
Slightly more mild solicited adverse reactions were 
observed in subjects who received ATIV compared 
with those who received TIV. Rates of AEs were 
similar in the ATIV and TIV groups. These data are in 
agreement with previous studies of MF59-adjuvanted 
influenza vaccine in young children [14,25,30-32], and 
support the well-established safety profile of MF59 
adjuvant [24-27]. The MF59-adjuvanted study vaccine 
induced considerably higher antibody titers than the 
non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine. In addition to 
increasing vaccine antigen-specific (homologous) 
antibody responses, MF59-adjuvanted vaccine was 
shown to enhance the production of anti-A and anti-B 
strain-specific cross-reactive antibodies. These data 
are in agreement with previous studies  the ability of 
MF59 to heighten levels of heterologous immunity 
against influenza is well-documented [16-23]. MF59-
induced heterologous protection against antigenic drift 
is particularly advantageous in tropical regions of the 
world, where both northern and southern hemisphere 
influenza strains co-circulate. 
Circulation of influenza A strains was reported in 
Guatemala during the time of this study [32]; this fact 
may explain the atypically high anti-A strain antibody 
levels observed at baseline and after the first vaccine 
dose in both ATIV and TIV groups. This study 
demonstrated 
MF59-adjuvanted 
vaccine 
to 
be 
particularly beneficial in terms of enhancing B strain-
specific antibody responses. The CBER licensure 
criteria for B strain antibody responses were only met 
by MF59-adjuvanted vaccine, whereas non-adjuvanted 
TIV failed to meet the seroprotection criterion. B 
strain influenza is responsible for a significant 
proportion of the influenza-related hospitalizations 
that occur each year in the pediatric population 
[33,34], with proportionally more B strain infections 
occurring in children than in adults or the elderly 
[34,35]. 
The results of this study demonstrate that MF59-
adjuvanted, trivalent influenza vaccine is well-
tolerated and induces seroprotective antibody titers 
able to provide children from 6 to < 60 months of age 
with 
vaccine 
antigen-specific 
and 
heterologous 
immunity against seasonal influenza disease.
