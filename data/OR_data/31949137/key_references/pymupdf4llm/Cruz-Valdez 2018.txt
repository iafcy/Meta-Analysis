ABSTRACT
The poor immune response elicited by trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) in children can be enhanced by the
addition of adjuvants. This observer-blind, randomized Phase III trial assessed the immunogenicity and safety of
the MF59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine FLUAD[�] (aTIV) and a non-adjuvanted TIV, in healthy children
(aged 6 to <72 months) from 3 centers in Mexico, during the 2014–2015 season. The primary objectives were to
assess the non-inferiority of aTIV to TIV, measured by geometric mean titers (GMTs), and the safety of aTIV and
TIV. Seroconversion was one of several secondary objectives. In total, 287 children were enrolled. The noninferiority criteria for GMTs and seroconversion were met for aTIV for all 3 vaccine strains. Lower bounds of the
95% confidence intervals for all 3 aTIV:TIV vaccine ratios were >2, showing that the immunogenicity of aTIV was
superior to that of TIV for all 3 strains. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were experienced more frequently with aTIV
than TIV by younger children (aged 6 to <36 months), but were more frequent with TIV than aTIV in older
children (aged 36 to <72 months) who had been vaccinated previously. More unsolicited AEs were associated
with aTIV than the TIV. All AEs were of mild or moderate severity. No deaths, serious AEs, or AEs leading to
premature withdrawal were reported. Overall, aTIV was highly immunogenic and was well tolerated in healthy
children 6 to <72 months of age. These results indicate that aTIV may be a beneficial addition to national
pediatric vaccination programs.

Introduction

Influenza is a serious disease as it can lead to severe morbidity
and mortality in at-risk groups such as children.[1] Children
experience the highest attack rates for influenza[1] and while
infections can be self-limiting in many cases, the risk of hospitalization is increased in this population compared with healthy
adults.[2] Children can also disseminate influenza in households
and the community as they shed virus for longer periods than
adults, leading to influenza infections in others, including those
at-risk (e.g. older adults [aged �65 years], those with co-morbidities, and younger children).[3,4]

Influenza was one of the top 10 causes of death in Mexico in
2014 and therefore it is considered a public health priority.[5] In
2013, there were 4480 cases of confirmed influenza across all
age groups, which led to 314 deaths, the majority of whom
were vulnerable or at-risk.[5] An assessment of those hospitalized
for influenza-like illness in Mexico City confirmed influenza
A/H3N2 and B in 25 and 29% respectively, of those aged
�18 years. Furthermore, of the different viruses assessed, the
influenza virus was the most commonly identified.[6]


Vaccination is the most effective method for preventing
influenza and seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended
by the World Health Organization (WHO) for children aged
6 months to 5 years.[7] For example, estimates from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that influenza vaccination averted approximately 7.2 million illnesses, 3.1 million
medically attended illnesses, and 90,000 hospitalizations associated with influenza, across all ages, in the 2013–2014 influenza
season in the United States alone.[8] In Mexico, seasonal influenza vaccination has been shown to significantly (p D 0.00002)
reduce influenza-related hospitalizations in children aged
<5 years, from 7.5% before the vaccination program to 3.4%
after vaccination was introduced.[9] However, children tend to
have a weak and short-lived immune response to current nonadjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) because their
immune systems are immature.[2,4,10] The addition of adjuvants
to trivalent influenza vaccines (aTIVs) can enhance the
immune response, potentially improving protection in this
population.[2,11-13]

The influenza vaccine FLUAD[�] includes the oil-in-water
adjuvant MF59, which has been shown to boost the immune
response in children, adults, and elderly individuals.[10,12,14-16]

Results from several clinical trials in adults and the elderly have
demonstrated the immunogenicity of FLUAD in these patient
populations and it has been licensed for influenza prophylaxis
in older adults since 1997.[14,15,17] Results from a large Phase III
trial in over 6000 children showed that higher and more durable hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers against both homologous and heterologous influenza strains were induced
following vaccination with FLUAD (n D 3125) than with the
TIV.[11] In agreement with previous reports, reactogenicity rates
were higher in FLUAD recipients than non-adjuvanted vaccine
recipients, and the majority of events were mild or moderate in
severity.[11] Results from another Phase III trial that included
over 4500 young children (aged 6–72 months), showed that
FLUAD (n D 1934) was associated with an increase in vaccine
efficacy, antibody responses, and durability compared with a
non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine.[12] Antibody titers of �40
against heterologous strains were also induced by 2 doses of
FLUAD in �95% of recipients. The proportion of children
aged 6–<36 months that experienced an adverse event (AE)
was comparable between vaccination groups, with a relative
risk of a solicited AE of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI]
0.98–1.09) for aTIV:TIV.[12] FLUAD was recently licensed in
Canada for seasonal vaccination of children aged 6–


<24 months.[18] FLUAD is currently approved in 38 countries,
including Canada and many European countries, and it was
recently approved by US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for the prevention of seasonal influenza in individuals
aged �65 years.[19]

This Phase III trial aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of FLUAD (aTIV), compared with a non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Fluzone[�]; TIV), in healthy children at 3 centers in
Mexico. The results will provide further evidence of the tolerability and immunogenicity of FLUAD in a pediatric population.

Results

Children

In total, 287 healthy children were enrolled, 144 in the aTIV group
and 143 in the TIV group (Fig. 1). Similar numbers of children
were excluded from the per protocol population of each vaccine
group; 30 from the aTIV group and 31 from the TIV group (Fig. 1).
The most common reason for exclusion for both groups was
non-compliance with the blood draw schedule. Similar numbers of
children were enrolled by the 3 centers (n D 95, 117, and 75).
The vaccine groups were well balanced at baseline (Table 1).
The mean age was 29.5 months for the aTIV group and
30.1 months for TIV, the split of males to females was approximately even and 99% of children in either arm were Hispanic.

Overall, more children in both vaccine groups were vaccinena€ıve and there was an even distribution of children across the
3 age groups in both vaccine groups (Table 1).

Immunogenicity

The non-inferiority criteria for geometric mean titers (GMTs)
were met for all 3 virus strains in the overall population at
21 days after the last vaccination (Table 2, Fig. 2). The GMTs
were higher in the aTIV group than in the TIV group at
21 days after the last vaccination. The mean GMT ratios (95%
CIs) for aTIV:TIV were: 4 (3–6) for A(H1N1) strain, 3 (2–4)
for A(H3N2) strain, and 5 (3–6) for the B strain.
This protocol prospectively allowed for a superiority analysis
in the event that the primary objective of GMT non-inferiority
was met. The GMT ratio of aTIV to TIV was evaluated, with
greater margins than the non-inferiority cutoff of 0.67. Lower
bounds of the 95% CIs for all 3 aTIV:TIV vaccine ratios were
>2, showing that the immunogenicity elicited by aTIV was
superior to that of TIV for the 3 vaccine strains tested (Fig. 2).
Analysis of GMTs by age subgroups showed that they were
higher with aTIV than with TIV in all 3 groups and for all 3 vaccine strains (Table 3). The GMT vaccine group ratios across all 3
strains were largest in the youngest (6–<18 months) age subgroup and smallest in the oldest (36–<72 months) age subgroup.
At 21 days after the last vaccination, the seroconversion rate
following vaccination with aTIV met the non-inferiority criteria
for all 3 virus strains in the overall population (Fig. 3). When
analyzed by age, the seroconversion rate was greater for aTIV

than for TIV in all 3 groups, for all 3 strains. The difference
between the 2 vaccines was particularly pronounced for the B
strain (Table 4). The proportion of children achieving HI titers
�40, and the more stringent HI titer assessments, �110, and
�330, 21 days after the last vaccination was higher for aTIV than
for TIV, for all 3 virus strains and the 95% CIs did not overlap
for the A(H1N1) and B strains (Fig. 4). When immunogenicity
for the aTIV was analyzed separately in children who were vaccine-na€ıve (not received �2 doses of seasonal influenza vaccine
since 1 July 2010) and non-na€ıve (received �2 doses of seasonal
influenza vaccine since 1 July 2010), vaccine status appeared to
have little effect on the response for all 3 strains. GMTs for the
aTIV were of a similar magnitude for the 2 groups, with larger
geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for the vaccine-na€ıve than for the
non-na€ıve group. For the aTIV, the proportion of children
achieving HI titers �40, �110, and �330 was also similar for
vaccine-na€ıve and non-na€ıve, for all 3 strains and at all 3 thresholds. For the TIV, vaccine status did appear to influence GMTs
as they were higher for the non-na€ıve than for the na€ıve group.
GMRs varied by strain for the TIV; the GMR was larger for the
non-na€ıve than for the na€ıve group for the A(H1N1) strain, while
the reverse was true for the A(H3N2) strain. The GMRs were
strain similar for the 2 groups for the B strain. For the TIV, the
proportion of children achieving HI titers �40, �110, and �330
was higher in the non-na€ıve than in the na€ıve group for all 3
strains. These differences were particularly pronounced at the
highest threshold for A(H1N1) and A(H3N2).

Safety

The number of children aged 6–<36 months in the non-na€ıve
group (n D 44) was smaller than the number in the na€ıve group

(n D 137). In vaccine-na€ıve children aged 6 to <36 months, the
proportion experiencing any solicited AEs after any vaccination
was higher in the group that received aTIV (74%) than in those
who received TIV (59%). In addition, this difference between
the proportions decreased from the first vaccination to the second vaccination (Table 5A). The most common solicited local
and systemic events in vaccine-na€ıve children aged 6 to
<36 months were injection-site tenderness (aTIV 45%; TIV
32%) and irritability (aTIV 37%; TIV 25%), respectively. The
proportion of non-na€ıve children aged 6–<36 months
experiencing any solicited AE was higher with aTIV than with
TIV (Table 5A). The most common solicited local and systemic
events in this group were injection-site tenderness (aTIV 41%;
TIV 19%) and diarrhea (aTIV 14%; TIV 27%), respectively.
In the 36–<72 months age group, the number of vaccinena€ıve children was too small for any meaningful analysis
(Table 5B). In the non-na€ıve group aged 36 to <72 months,
slightly more children in the TIV group compared with the aTIV
group experienced any event, which is likely to result from a difference in the rate of local events (Table 5B). The most common
solicited local and systemic events in the non-na€ıve group aged
36 to <72 months were injection-site pain (aTIV 32%; TIV 40%)
and change in eating habits (aTIV 18%; TIV 8%), respectively.
The majority of solicited local and systemic AEs in both age
groups were of mild or moderate intensity. Severe injection-site
pain was reported for 3 children only; 2 aged 6 to <36 months
(1 vaccine-na€ıve and 1 non-na€ıve) and 1 aged 36 to <72 months
(vaccine non-na€ıve), all had received aTIV. In vaccine-na€ıve children aged 6 to <36 months severe solicited systemic reactions
were reported for 3 who received aTIV (irritability n D 1 and
diarrhea n D 2) and 5 who received TIV (persistent crying,

vomiting, diarrhea, all n D 1 and irritability n D 2). Severe solicited systemic reactions were reported for 2 non-na€ıve children
aged 36 to <72 months only (chills and myalgia, both n D 1)
and both had received aTIV. No severe systemic reactions were
reported for non-na€ıve children aged 6 to <36 months or for vaccine-na€ıve children aged 36 to <72 months.
The rate of unsolicited AEs reported for children (aged 6 to
<72 months) was of a similar magnitude for aTIV and TIV, in
both those who were vaccination-na€ıve (45% and 38%, respectively) and those who were non-na€ıve (14% and 9%, respectively)
(Table 6). The most commonly reported unsolicited AE was
nasopharyngitis for aTIV (22%) and pharyngitis (14%) for TIV,
in vaccine-na€ıve children. In non-na€ıve children nasopharyngitis
was the most commonly reported unsolicited AE for both aTIV
and TIV (both 3%). The proportion of children that experienced
medically attended AEs (MAAEs) was comparable between the
vaccine groups for both the na€ıve and non-na€ıve groups, with
far fewer being reported by non-na€ıve children (Table 6). No
deaths, no serious adverse events (SAEs), and no AEs leading to
premature withdrawal were reported (Table 6).

Discussion

The increased risk of influenza infection in children, compared
with healthy adults, has prompted many countries, including
those in North America, to incorporate annual influenza vaccinations into their healthcare programs, as recommended by the
WHO.[7] The currently available TIVs elicit a sub-optimal immune
response in children, spurring the development of vaccines with
adjuvants such as AS03 or MF59, which stimulate more robust
antibody production against the influenza antigens.

The results from this study show that the aTIV was noninferior to the TIV for all 3 vaccine strains tested in healthy
children aged 6–<72 months in Mexico, during the 2014–2015
season. The magnitude of the GMT ratios shows that the aTIV
has a superior immune response than that of TIV against all 3
virus strains tested. These findings support those of previous
studies of aTIV in children that have shown higher immune

responses, compared with TIV.[11,12] These findings are unlikely
to be due to differences between the 2 brands of vaccine as they
contained the same antigens at the same concentrations and
similar excipients, as well as being administered in the same
way. Therefore, it is most likely to be the inclusion of the MF59
adjuvant in the vaccine that improved the immune response of
the aTIV compared with the TIV.
While efficacy of the adjuvanted vaccine has been shown previously, with a relative efficacy versus TIV of 75% (95% CI:
55–87)[12] the superiority of the adjuvanted vaccine over nonadjuvanted vaccines has not been demonstrated before.
Although 2 previous studies assessing aTIV in young children
have shown high immune responses, neither have shown superiority of aTIV over TIV.[11,12] One study[11] failed to meet the prespecified criteria to show superiority, which required GMT and
seroconversion rates to reach statistical significance: although
the superiority criteria for GMT were met, those for seroconversion were not. The second study[12] could not demonstrate superiority as this was not prospectively included in the study design.
Nonetheless, the consistently higher GMTs reported with aTIV
in both studies, against both homologous and heterologous
influenza strains, and the superior immunogenicity of aTIV
compared with TIV in the present study underscore the immunologic benefit derived from the MF59 adjuvant.
In this study, HI titers were higher in the aTIV group than

3 strains. Assessment of HI titers �110 and �330 is important
because the use of HI �40 as a correlate of protection is based
on studies in adults and has been shown to be inappropriate
for evaluating responses in children, based on antibody titers
against H3N2.[20] Antibody titers of �110 for H3N2 have been
shown to predict a 50% clinical protection rate, which is similar
to the rate for titers of �40 in adults. However, the �330 cutoff
was shown to predict an 80% clinical protection rate for H3N2,
which may offer a public health benefit.[20]

The robust immunogenicity demonstrated by the aTIV is
important for the pediatric population as children tend to have a
poor response to non-adjuvanted TIV while experiencing the
highest attack rates for influenza and a high burden of morbidity.[2,4] In Mexico, the H1N1 and H3N2 strains are known to be
endemic and were identified as the predominant circulating
strains during the 2013–2014 winter.[5] Furthermore, a recent
sero-analysis has shown that, despite high transmission rates of A
(H1N1) during the 2009 pandemic in Mexico, a large proportion
of the population, including children, have no or low levels of A
(H1N1)pdm09 neutralizing antibodies, and so they remain susceptible to infection.[21] Together these findings illustrate the need
for a vaccine that induces a strong immune response in children.
In Mexico, the influenza vaccination program is based on the use
of TIVs, therefore the aTIV assessed in this study may be a useful
addition as it has shown superior immunogenicity to a TIV.
Cross-reactive immune responses can also be beneficial in
children when vaccine strains and circulating viruses are mismatched. Heterologous responses were not assessed in the
study reported here, but it is highly likely that the pattern of
increased cross-reactive responses elicited by the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine, as reported in other prior pediatric studies,[11,12]

could also have occurred in the children included in this study.
The results from this study show that the aTIV was well tolerated, supporting inclusion of this vaccine in pediatric seasonal
influenza vaccination programs. The proportions of children
experiencing solicited AEs were higher for aTIV than they were
for TIV, but no AEs led to withdrawal from the study. The pattern of unsolicited AEs was similar for aTIV and TIV and no
SAEs were reported. Overall, the safety results described here are
aligned with those from previous reports,[11,12] with no new emergent concerns.
AS03 is another proprietary adjuvant used in influenza vaccines to enhance the immune response. MF59 and AS03 are
both oil-based adjuvants that contain squalene, but a-tocopherol
is also present in AS03,[22] but not MF59.[14] The AS03-adjuvanted
monovalent pandemic (H1N1) vaccine in children has been
shown to be effective in preventing influenza-related hospitalization[23,24] and to be clinically superior to a non-adjuvanted pandemic monovalent vaccine.[25] An early study of an AS03adjuvanted TIV has shown that this vaccine is also immunogenic.[26] Safety analyses have shown that while the AS03-adjuvanted monovalent vaccine is generally well tolerated, there may
be an increased risk of febrile seizures, although the risk was less
than that associated with contracting pandemic influenza,[27] and
there may also be an increased risk of narcolepsy,[28] which has
been tentatively associated with a-tocopherol.[29] These results
support the use of non-aluminum based adjuvants to enhance
the immune response to influenza vaccines and also illustrate


This study has some limitations. The study is small and there
were few older children (aged 36–<72 months) in the vaccinena€ıve group, making sub-analyses of this population challenging.
However, this is to be expected as most children will have
received at least 1 vaccination by this age, and so it is reflective of
the prevailing clinical practice. In addition, many children were
excluded from immunogenicity study analyses owing to noncompliance with the blood draw schedule. This non-compliance
was an unavoidable consequence of a concurrent national vaccination campaign, which was initiated by the government after
more than half the subjects in this study had been enrolled.
Assessment of the immune responses against heterologous
strains in this population would also have provided useful additional data describing the breadth of immunogenicity of these
vaccines. One strength of this study is that the inclusion and
analysis of both vaccine-na€ıve and non-na€ıve children makes it
more reflective of actual clinical practice. The randomized, controlled, observer-blind design of the study has allowed robust
analysis of the data and hence clear conclusions to be drawn.

Conclusions

The aTIV was highly immunogenic and well tolerated in
healthy children in Mexico. The HI titers elicited show that
the aTIV is not only non-inferior to TIV with respect to
GMT and seroconversion rates, but also that the GMT data
for aTIV are superior to TIV. Overall, these findings suggest
that the aTIV may be a beneficial addition to pediatric vaccination programs.

Methods

Study design

This was an observer-blind, multicenter, randomized Phase III trial
that assessed the safety and immunogenicity of vaccination with
FLUAD, an aTIV, compared with an unadjuvanted TIV
(Fluzone[�]) in healthy children in Mexico. The trial was conducted
at 3 centers in Mexico, between 23 October 2014 and 20 May 2015.
The primary objectives were: to demonstrate non-inferiority
of aTIV to TIV, measured by GMTs and to assess the safety of
the aTIV and TIV. Secondary objectives included: assessment of
non-inferiority of aTIV to TIV by seroconversion; evaluation of
immunogenicity of aTIV and TIV by GMRs and the proportion
of children with HI titers �40, �110, and �330; and if non-inferiority was established, to evaluate the GMT ratio of aTIV to
TIV using margins greater than the non-inferiority cutoff.

Children

Healthy male and female children aged 6–<72 months whose
parent(s) or guardian(s) had voluntarily given written informed
consent and who could comply with the trial procedures were
included in the study. Children and their parent(s) or guardian
(s) also had to agree to have serum samples stored for future
testing (Table S1).
Major exclusion criteria included: any progressive, unstable,
or uncontrolled clinical conditions or a fatal prognosis; hyper

-----

severe neurological disorders or Guillain-Barr�e syndrome;
abnormal functioning of the immune system; contraindication
of intramuscular (IM) vaccination; or any clinical condition or
planned procedure that might interfere with the trial schedule
or results. Receipt of influenza (within 6 months) or other vaccines (within 14 days) also precluded enrollment (Table S1).
Children were stratified 1:1:1 by age group; 6–<18 months,
18–<36 months, and 36–<72 months and were assigned randomly 1:1 within the strata to receive vaccination with aTIV
(FLUAD) or the TIV (Fluzone[�]), according to the prescribing
information, on Day 1 (Fig. 1). Centers for conducting this
study were selected based on their experience in clinical
research and their access to a pediatric population. At each center, randomization was assigned based on the given subject
number, using a validated web-based system, which automatically generated the group assignment in the specified ratio.
Previous influenza vaccination status for eligible children
was defined as: “vaccine non-na€ıve” – children who had
received 2 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since 1
July 2010; “vaccine-na€ıve” – children who had not received 2 or
more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since 1 July 2010.

Vaccines

The aTIV (batch numbers: #IA142503 and IA142501) and the
comparator TIV (batch number: IAU1189AC) contained
�15mg HA of A/H1N1 (California/2009), A/H3N2 (Texas/
2012), and B influenza (Massachusetts/2012), according to the
WHO recommendations for 2014/2015. Both vaccines were
administered IM; in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh to subjects aged <36 months, or in the deltoid muscle of the (preferably) non-dominant arm to subjects aged >36 months.
Children aged 6–<36 months received a 0.25 mL dose of vaccine and those aged �36 months received a 0.5 mL dose of vaccine, as recommended by medical guidelines. Children who were
influenza non-na€ıve received 1 vaccination with either aTIV or
TIV on Day 1. Children who were vaccine-na€ıve received 2 vaccinations with either aTIV or TIV on Days 1 and 29.

Study endpoints

GMTs were assessed by HI assay from blood samples (each
approximately 5 mL) taken on Day 1 and on Day 22 for nonna€ıve children and on Day 1 and Day 50 for na€ıve children. HI
titers were also used to calculate the proportion of children
achieving seroconversion on Day 22 for non-na€ıve and Day 50
for na€ıve children for all 3 vaccine strains and GMRs from
baseline. The proportion of children with a HI titer �40, �110,
and �330 on Day 1 and on Day 22 for non-na€ıve children and
on Day 1 and Day 50 for na€ıve children was also assessed.
The HI assay is a standard, widely used measure based on
the binding of anti-hemagglutinin antibodies blocking the
interaction between influenza viruses and red blood cells. HI
assays were conducted by Novartis or a designated laboratory
and, very briefly, involved: a standard number of red blood cells
were incubated with serially diluted sera in the presence of viral
isolates, and red blood cell agglutination recorded.
Solicited local and systemic AEs were collected using a diary


The diary card was completed daily, reporting solicited local and
systemic AEs from Day 1 to Day 7, following each vaccination. For
non-na€ıve children, all unsolicited AEs, along with any treatments,
were recorded from Day 1 to Day 22. In na€ıve children, all unsolicited AEs, along with any treatments, were recorded from Day 1 to
Day 29. Following the second vaccination, the diary card was completed for a further 6 days and unsolicited AEs were recorded for a
further 21 days. Solicited local reactions included: ecchymosis, erythema, induration, swelling; and tenderness in children aged 6–
<36 months; or pain in children 36–<72 months. Local reactions
were categorized as: none (0 mm), any (�1 mm). Systemic reactions included: change in eating habits, vomiting, diarrhea, and
fever �38[�]C. In children aged 6–<36 months, sleepiness, persistent crying, irritability were also included, while in children aged
36–<72 months, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and fatigue
were evaluated. The severity of all AEs was classified as mild, moderate, or severe by the investigator, based on specific criteria for
solicited AEs, and the relationship of an AE to the study treatment
was defined by the investigator as not, possibly, or probably related.
SAEs were recorded by the investigator and assessed for the relationship to the vaccine.

Statistical analyses

Children were recruited from central and southern areas of the
country, as well as the metropolitan area of Mexico City, meaning the sample was representative of the general population.
Sample size was determined based on previous trial data to
demonstrate that at 21 days after the last vaccination, the GMT
ratios of aTIV to TIV were non-inferior, with the lower limit of
the 2-sided 95% CI above 0.67 (¡0.176 on log10 scale) for each
vaccine strain (1-sided a D 2.5%). With 126 subjects per group,
a single test has a power of 92% for H1N1 and >99% for H3N2
and B. As there were 3 comparisons, the resulting power was
90%. Therefore, to account for subject withdrawals, 141 children were recruited to each group.
The per protocol set was used for all the immunogenicity
analyses. The primary analyses were repeated using the full
analysis set as a measure of sensitivity. Safety endpoints were
reported by vaccine group and included: the proportion of children reporting solicited local and systemic AEs from Day 1 to
Day 7 following each vaccination; the proportion of children
reporting unsolicited AEs from Day 1 to Day 22 for non-na€ıve
children and from Day 1 to Day 50 for na€ıve children; and the
proportion of children with MAAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, and SAEs from Day 1 to Day 22 for non-na€ıve children
and from Day 1 to Day 50 for na€ıve children.
Immunogenicity endpoints, including GMTs, seroconversion, GMRs, and HI titers were reported by vaccine group
on Days 1 and 22 for non-na€ıve children and on Days 1 and
50 for na€ıve children. Seroconversion was defined as HI �40
subject with a pre-vaccination HI titer <10; a minimum
4-fold increase HI titer for children with a pre-vaccination
HI titer �10, on Day 22 for non-na€ıve children or Day 50
for na€ıve children. GMRs were calculated as Day 22/Day 1
for non-na€ıve children or Day 50/Day1 for na€ıve children.
GMTs and associated CIs were determined using analysis
of covariance with factors for vaccine group, age group,


-----

The primary objective was determined to have been met if
the GMT ratios of aTIV to TIV 21 days after the last vaccination were demonstrated to be non-inferior, with the lower
limit of the 2-sided 95% CI being above 0.67 for each vaccine
strain. Non-inferiority of seroconversion for aTIV compared
with TIV would be shown if the lower limit of the 95% CI
around the difference in seroconversion rates between aTIV
and TIV was higher than ¡10%. If non-inferiority of GMT
ratios 21 days after the last vaccination was demonstrated,
then “higher non-inferiority”/superiority was tested. The superiority margin would be increased by 0.01 unit (on the log
scale) and superiority would be demonstrated if the lower
limit of the 2-sided 95% CI was at least equal to the margin.
Sample size was calculated based on data from previous studies. A single test with 126 children in each vaccine group has
a power of 92% for H1N1 and >99% for H3N2 and B strains.
Therefore, the overall power is 90%. To account for dropouts,
141 children were planned to be included in each group.
