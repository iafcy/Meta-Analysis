Background. The vaccine efficacy (VE) of 1 or 2 doses of AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1) vaccine relative
to that of 2 doses of nonadjuvanted influenza A(H1N1) vaccine in children 6 months to <10 years of age in a multinational study conducted during 2010–2011.

Methods. A total of 6145 children were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive 2 injections 21 days
apart of A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-AS03 vaccine at dose 1 and saline placebo at dose 2, 2 doses 21 days apart
of A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-AS03 vaccine (the Ad2 group), or 2 doses 21 days apart of nonadjuvanted A/California/7/2009(H1N1) vaccine (the NAd2 group). Active surveillance for influenza-like illnesses continued from days
14 to 385. Nose and throat samples obtained during influenza-like illnesses were tested for A/California/7/2009
(H1N1), using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety were
assessed.

Results. There were 23 cases of confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (A[H1N1]pdm09) infection for
the primary relative VE analysis. The VE in the Ad2 group relative to that in the NAd2 group was 76.8% (95% confidence interval, 18.5%–93.4%). The benefit of the AS03 adjuvant was demonstrated in terms of the greater immunogenicity observed in the Ad2 group, compared with the NAd2 group.

Conclusion. The 4–8-fold antigen-sparing adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine demonstrated superior and
clinically important prevention of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, compared with nonadjuvanted vaccine, with no observed increase in medically attended or serious adverse events. These data support the use of adjuvanted influenza
vaccines during influenza pandemics.

transmission among households, daycare centers, and schools

[1, 2]. During the 2009–2010 pandemic of influenza A(H1N1)
(hereafter, A[H1N1]pdm09) infection, the highest attack rates
were observed in children <18 years of age [3].Inactivated influenza vaccines historically have shown only moderate efficacy in
children, particularly among those <2 years of age [4], although
improved efficacy of an oil-in-water–adjuvanted (MF59) trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine was recently reported in young
children [5].Moreover, an antigen-sparing AS03-adjuvanted inactivated pandemic influenza vaccine against A(H1N1)pdm09
offered children superior immunogenicity relative to conventional unadjuvanted formulations, with an acceptable safety
profile [6]. Therefore, in a large cohort of children, we used
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based confirmation
of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection to evaluate the efficacy of a split
virion A/California/7/2009(H1N1)v-like AS03-adjuvanted vaccine (H1N1-AS03; Arepanrix [GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines]) relative to that of a nonadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine made with the
same virus strain but formulated at a conventional dose in preventing A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Antibody persistence was
monitored for either 6 months or 1 year after vaccination.
Our objective was to assess whether the vaccine candidate’s superior immunogenicity translated into improved disease
prevention.

METHODS

Study Design and Subjects
This randomized, prospective phase 3 observer-blinded study
was conducted in 17 centers in Australia, Brazil, Colombia,
Costa Rica, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand
between 15 February 2010 and 19 August 2011. The study
was approved by an institutional review board at each participating center. Written informed consent was obtained from
parents or guardians of participating healthy children 6 months
to <10 years (6 month to <10) of age before the children received the first vaccine dose.

Randomization
Participants were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1:1 to 1 of 3
treatment groups to receive 2 intramuscular injections 21 days
apart. Group Ad1 received H1N1-AS03 at dose 1 and placebo
(saline) at dose 2; group Ad2 received 2 doses of H1N1-AS03;
group NAd2 received 2 doses of nonadjuvanted A/California/7/
2009(H1N1) vaccine. The randomization procedure used a
minimization algorithm accounting for center, age stratum (6
to <36 months or 3 to <10 years), and prior seasonal influenza
vaccination status. These factors had equal weight in the
minimization algorithm; that is, a participant’s vaccine group
allocation was based on the balance of the combination of all
the minimization factors. Each age stratum was capped such

population.

Vaccines
Each dose of H1N1-AS03 vaccine contained 1.9 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) mixed with AS03B in a total delivery volume of
0.25 mL. AS03B is an oil-in-water emulsion containing squalene
and DL-α-tocopherol (5.93 mg) in an aqueous phase [7].
The nonadjuvanted vaccine contained 30 µg of HA in 1 mL,
and the volume (ie, HA dose) administered varied with age:
children <3 years of age in the NAd2 group received two
0.25-mL doses (ie, 7.5 µg of HA), and children 3 to <10 years
of age received two 0.5-mL doses (ie, 15 µg of HA). Placebo
was 0.5 mL of saline. Single lots of the adjuvanted antigen, nonadjuvanted antigen, and adjuvant were used. Vaccines were administered into the deltoid (or anterior thigh, if the child was
<12 months of age), using a needle length suitable for intramuscular administration.

Study Objectives
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of 2 doses of
H1N1-AS03 relative to that of 2 doses of nonadjuvanted vaccine
beginning 14 days after dose 1 and continuing until study conclusion on day 385. Noninferiority in terms of relative vaccine
efficacy (VE) was concluded if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for relative VE against real-time PCR–
confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection (Ad2 vs NAd2) was
≥33%. Superiority was concluded if the lower limit of the
95% CI for relative VE was >0.
Secondary study objectives with predefined criteria (and no
type 1 error adjustment) included (1) VE for Ad1 relative to
that of NAd2, using the same criteria specified for the primary
objective; (2) relative VE for any pneumonia, any pneumonia
in individuals within 6 weeks of real-time PCR–positive
A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, and any influenza-like illness (ILI);
and (3) assessment of specific antibody titers at day 42.
The adjuvant effect on immunogenicity was assessed by comparing A/California/7/09 hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibody responses at day 42 in terms of geometric mean titer
(GMT) ratios and differences in seroconversion rate (SCR) by
group. Adjuvant effect was demonstrated if the lower limit of
the 95% CI for GMT ratio was >1.0 and the lower limit of
the 95% CI for the group difference in the seroconversion rate
was >0.
Reactogenicity and safety of the study vaccines and antibody
persistence at days 182 and 385 were summarized descriptively
as part of the evaluation of secondary objectives.

Evaluation of Influenza Outcomes
Passive surveillance began on day 0 and active surveillance via
telephone contacts began for all subjects approximately 2 weeks
after dose 1 and continued every 1–2 weeks until day 385. Parents and legal guardians notified the investigator if the child

route and at least 1 of the following: new or worsening cough,
sore throat, nasal congestion, and/or rhinorrhea). Nasal and
throat swab specimens were collected within 7 days after
symptom onset. A 7-day symptom-free period was required
between ILI episodes to consider the subsequent episode distinct from the initial episode. Detection of influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09, using real-time PCR (and of all influenza virus strains,
using multiplex PCR), is described in the Supplementary Materials. Only real-time PCR–positive samples underwent viral
culture [8].

Immunogenicity Assessment
Blood samples were collected before vaccination and 21 days
after receipt of dose 2 (ie, on day 42) from all subjects. HI antibody levels were measured in a random subset of approximately 60 children in each treatment group from each
participating country. The HI assay used chicken erythrocytes

[9–11], and the lowest dilution tested was 1:10. The titration
end point was the highest dilution step that showed complete
(ie, 100%) inhibition of hemagglutination. A further blood sample was collected at either day 182 or day 385 from consenting
subjects.

Safety and Reactogenicity Assessment
Injection site and systemic symptoms were recorded on diary
cards for 7 days after each dose. Solicited symptoms were
based on the ability to report by age and were therefore different


≥6 years). All other adverse events (AEs) were recorded from
the first dose until day 42. Medically attended AEs, serious
AEs (SAEs), and potential immune-mediated diseases were recorded until day 385. All solicited injection site reactions were
considered causally related to vaccination. Potentially causal relationships between vaccination and all other AEs were assessed
by the site investigator.

Statistical Methods
The analysis was performed by an externally contracted statistical analyst. A second statistician from the same company performed an independent quality validation.

Vaccine Efficacy
Efficacy was assessed in the according-to-protocol (ATP) efficacy cohort, which included all evaluable subjects who received 2
doses, who were successfully contacted at least once after the
first vaccination, and who complied with protocol-defined procedures. The relative VE was calculated as 1 − relative risk (RR),
where the RR is defined as the risk of real-time PCR–confirmed
cases among subjects receiving H1N1-AS03 versus the risk of
real-time PCR–confirmed cases among subjects receiving
NAd2. RR was estimated via a Cox proportional hazard regression model (time to first event), with vaccine group as a fixed
variable, and was adjusted by covariates of age, seasonal influenza vaccine history, and country. Subjects meeting censoring
criteria (ie, receipt of protocol-forbidden vaccines or

California/7/09-like H1N1 antigen) were included in the analysis until the date of censoring or were excluded if the censoring
criteria were met before the disease end point occurred. The relative VE (with 95% CI) was calculated for the 14–385-day (primary end point) and 0–385-day surveillance periods. Secondary
analyses were done on the total vaccinated cohort, which included all children who received at least 1 vaccine dose.
During study preparation the future behavior of the pandemic was uncertain, but we projected a substantive third
wave in 2010. On the basis of 1800 evaluable subjects per
group, an assumed attack rate of 20% among unvaccinated subjects, and an assumed VE for nonadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of
40%, if 360 real-time PCR–confirmed influenza cases were
identified during the surveillance period, a lower limit of
≥33% for the 95% CI for the relative VE could be demonstrated
with >99.9% power, if the VE in the H1N1-AS03 group was
assumed to be 60% relative to that of a notional placebo.
Type 1 error adjustment was not made for secondary objective
evaluations.

Immunogenicity End Points
The following parameters were calculated (with 95% CIs) based
on A/California/7/09 HI titers: GMT; seroconversion rate, defined as the percentage of initially seronegative subjects (titer,


of initially seropositive vaccinees (titer, ≥1:10) with a ≥4-fold
increase in the postvaccination titer; seroprotection rate, defined
as the percentage of subjects with titers of ≥1:40 [12, 13]; and
seroconversion factor, defined as the ratio of the postvaccination
titer to the prevaccination titer.

Reactogenicity End Points
Reactogenicity data were summarized by vaccine group and age
stratum (from 6 months to <6 years and from 6 to <10 years)
because a different AE intensity scale was used for children of
different ages.

RESULTS

Study Subjects
Each study center contributed between 105 (1.7%) and 886
(14.4%) of the total 6145 enrolled and vaccinated subjects. Of
these, 5900 (96%) completed the study to day 42, and 5851
(95%) completed the study to day 385. Two children in the
Ad1 group withdrew before day 42 because of an AE or SAE:
1 child died of asthma and pneumonia 20 days after dose 1,
and 1 child had a nonserious upper respiratory tract infection.
Two children in Ad2 were withdrawn before day 385 because of
SAEs: 1 child drowned, and 1 died from an intestinal

The mean age (±SD) of all children at enrollment was
4.3 ± 2.64 years (range, 0.5–9 years); 49.8% (3058/6145) were
female. The study groups in each analysis cohort were compa[rable in terms of demographic characteristics (Supplementary](http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiu173/-/DC1)
[Table 1).](http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiu173/-/DC1)


Vaccine Efficacy
There were 3731 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected
from 4653 ILI episodes (81%). Multiplex PCR–confirmed influenza virus infection (any strain from days 14 to 385) occurred in
9.7% (95% CI, 8.4%–11.1%) of children in the Ad2 group, 8.4%
(95% CI, 7.2%–9.8%) in the Ad1 group, and 9.3% (95% CI,
8.1%–10.7%) in the NAd2 group.
During the entire study follow-up period, 28 children had
real-time PCR–confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection (Table 1):
11 were in the Philippines, 7 were in Thailand, 5 were in Australia, 3 were in Mexico, and 1 each was in Singapore and Costa
Rica. Three children developed influenza before day 14. One
child (in the NAd2 group) received the second vaccination 4
days after the protocol-specified visit window. One subject (in
the NAd2 group) was censored upon receiving seasonal trivalent vaccine 8 months after dose 1 and 3 months before onset
of A(H1N1)pdm09 disease. Therefore, among 5803 children included in ATP time-to-event efficacy analysis (days 14–385), 23
had real-time PCR-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, giving an attack rate in each group of 0.15% (in the Ad2 group),
0.34% (in the Ad1 group), and 0.68% (in the NAd2 group) in
the ATP cohort (Figure 1).
The efficacy of Ad2 over NAd2 for prevention of real-time
PCR-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection from days 14 to 385
was 76.8% (95% CI, 18.5%–93.4%). Both noninferiority and
superiority of Ad2 versus NAd2 were thus demonstrated according to the prespecified statistical criteria (Table 2). The relative VE
without adjustment for covariates of age, seasonal influenza vaccine history, and country was 77.1% (95% CI, 19.6%–93.5%).
Efficacy, noninferiority, and superiority of the 2-dose adjuvanted regimen were confirmed in the analysis of the total vaccinated cohort: the efficacy estimate for Ad2 over NAd2 was
78.5% (95% CI, 25.1%–93.8%; days 14–385).
Secondary analyses showed that Ad2 was noninferior to
NAd2 for efficacy in preventing culture-confirmed influenza
(days 14–385) and in preventing real-time PCR–confirmed
A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in the subgroup aged 3 to <10 years
(Table 1). Noninferiority was also observed for these end points
in the total vaccinated cohort analysis (data not shown).
The noninferiority criteria were not met for Ad1 versus NAd2

Immunogenicity
The ATP immunogenicity subset included 1175 children at day
42, 1693 at day 182, and 1526 at day 385. At day 42, the seroprotection rate was 100% for Ad2, 98.7% for Ad1, and 92.8% for
NAd2 (Table 3). Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research

(defined in Table 3) were fulfilled by all treatment groups (overall and by each age stratum) at day 42.
Adjuvant effect (Ad2 vs NAd2 groups) was demonstrated in
terms of seroconversion rate (lower limit of the 95% CI for the
difference between groups, 7.2%) and GMT ratios (lower limit
for 95% CI, 4.9). Adjuvant effect was also demonstrated in both
age strata (lower limit for 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rate between groups, 10.3% for ages 6 to <36 months
and 1.4% for ages 3 to <10 years; lower limit for the 95% CI
of the GMT ratio, 7.7 for ages 6 to <36 months and 2.4 for
ages 3 to <10 years; Figure 2).
Adjuvant effect was also observed for Ad1 versus NAd2
in terms of seroconversion rate overall (lower limit of the
95% CI for the difference between groups, 0.9%) but not
for GMT ratios. Adjuvant effect was observed for children
aged 6 to <36 months in terms of seroconversion rate (lower
limit of the 95% CI for the difference between groups, 8.6%)
and GMT ratios (lower limit for the 95% CI on the GMT
ratio, 1.3).
At day 385, the seroprotection rate was 97.3% for Ad2, 78.5%
for Ad1, and 67.9% for NAd2 (Table 3). HI GMTs were highest
in the Ad2 group at all postvaccination time points (Table 3).

Reactogenicity and Safety
Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported symptom in all groups after each dose (Figure 3) and was more frequent for Ad2 than NAd2. Grade 3 injection site reactions
were reported by no more than 4.3% of children after either dose.
The percentage of children in each age stratum reporting systemic solicited symptoms was similar among treatment groups
and after doses 1 and 2 (Figure 3), with the exception of fever
(oral or axillary temperature, ≥38.0°C) in the Ad2 group, which
increased from 10.2% (95% CI, 8.6%–11.9%) after dose 1 to
19.0% (95% CI, 16.9%–21.2%) after dose 2 in subjects aged 6
months to <6 years (an increase was observed in the subgroups
[aged 6 to <36 months and 3 to <6 years; Supplementary Table 2)](http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiu173/-/DC1)
and from 4.8% (95% CI, 3.3%–6.6%) to 8.7% (95% CI, 6.7%–
11.1%), respectively, in subjects aged 6 to <10 years. In the
Ad2 group, grade 3 fever (oral or axillary temperature of
≥39.0°C) was reported for 1.9% (95% CI, 1.2%–2.8%) of children aged 6 months to <6 years after dose 1 and for 3.1%
(95% CI, 2.2%–4.2%) after dose 2. Fever (defined as a temperature of >40.0°C) was only reported after dose 1: 2 episodes occurred in children in the Ad2 group, and 3 episodes occurred in
[each of the other groups (Supplementary Table 2).](http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiu173/-/DC1)
There were 15 children who experienced febrile convulsions
through day 385: 4 were in the Ad2 group, 6 were in the Ad1
group, and 5 were in the NAd2 group. Seven febrile convulsions
were reported as SAEs (Table 4). None occurred within 42 days
after vaccination, and none were considered vaccine related. One
so-called convulsion (fever was absent) was reported through day

redness or swelling in an area >100 mm in diameter, fever (ie, an oral or axillary temperature of ≥39.0°C), irritability (ie, crying that cannot be comforted or
that prevents normal activity), drowsiness (ie, prevention of normal activity), and loss of appetite (not eating at all). In children 6 to <10 years of age, grade 3
severity was defined as pain that prevents normal activity, redness or swelling in an area >100 mm in diameter, fever (ie, an oral/axillary temperature of
≥39.0°C), and, for all other symptoms, prevention of normal activity.


42 after vaccination (onset, 7 days after vaccination in a subject
from the Ad2 group who had preexisting epilepsy). The event
lasted 6 days and was not considered to be vaccine related.
Percentages of children with any AE within 42 days of vaccination requiring a medically attended visit were similar among
groups (23.4% for the Ad2 group, 22.9% for the Ad1 group, and
22.8% for the NAd2 group; Table 4).
During the 42-day follow-up period, 0.5% of subjects in the
Ad2 group, 0.9% in the Ad1 group, and 1.2% in the NAd2
group reported at least 1 grade 3 AE. None of the grade 3 symptoms reported in the Ad2 group were considered to be vaccine
related. One case of grade 3 headache in the Ad1 group and 1
case each of grade 3 vomiting and gastroenteritis in the NAd2
group were assessed as potentially vaccine related.
Percentages of children experiencing at least 1 SAE from days
0 to 385 were 3.7% in the Ad2 group, 3.2% in the Ad1 group,
and 3.3% in the NAd2 group. The 10 most frequently reported
SAEs were similar across groups (Table 4). One SAE (which involved a subject in theAd1 group, who required an emergency
department visit for gastroenteritis, with onset on the day of
dose 2) was considered to be vaccine related. There were 3
fatal events (all in the Philippines), and none were considered
vaccine related: 1 involved a 10-year-old child (in the Ad2


group), who drowned; 1 involved a 20-month-old child (in
the Ad2 group), who died from intestinal obstruction, parasitic
gastroenteritis, and aspiration pneumonia; and 1 involved a 6month-old child (in the Ad1 group), who had a history of pneumonia and asthma and died 20 days after vaccination from
community-acquired pneumonia and asthma (real-time PCR
negative). No autopsy was done.
During the study period, 1 potential immune-mediated disease was reported for the Ad2 group (0.05% of subjects), and 3
and 4 for the Ad1 (0.15%) and NAd2 (0.2%) groups, respectively
(Table 4).

DISCUSSION

This is the first prospective efficacy study commencing during
an influenza pandemic and the first to assess an AS03adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine in children. We found
a clinically important and statistically significant improvement
in the efficacy of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, compared with efficacy of the nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine. Moreover, improved efficacy was shown using one-fourth to one-eighth of
the standard dose of HA, and noninferiority was shown for a
single dose of adjuvanted vaccine (one-eighth to one-sixteenth

of the standard HA dose), although only in the total vaccinated
cohort (exploratory analysis).
We observed lower than expected numbers of real-time
PCR–confirmed cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, most likely
because of limited A(H1N1)pdm09 exposure during 2010,
owing to the absence of the anticipated third pandemic wave
during 2010 in the participating countries [14]. Furthermore,
all study subjects received active influenza vaccination. We believe our active surveillance was adequate, as many cases of ILI

4 JID 201 210 (1 A ) N l l


were evaluated, and subsequent testing revealed a substantial incidence of infection with respiratory syncytial virus and seasonal influenza virus types A and B. Potential effects of variability
between countries in active surveillance performance were minimized by the randomization process. Overall influenza incidence rates in each group had overlapping 95% CIs, which
does not support the proposition that the adjuvant groups experienced an unqualified general reduction in risk. Nevertheless, despite the low number of influenza cases, the relative

timated and was sufficient overall to reach a definitive conclusion. However, the low case numbers led to wide CIs for relative
VE estimates and increased the uncertainty regarding our exploration of secondary end points and subanalyses by age, although point estimates for relative VE were the same for
subjects younger and those older than 3 years.
This study commenced during the 2009–2010 influenza
A(H1N1) pandemic in expectation of a third pandemic wave,
and it was not considered ethically acceptable to include a placebo group. Even though the study could not provide absolute
VE values, these can be estimated using other sources from the
literature. If an absolute VE of 40% for 2 doses of nonadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine is assumed (from the study by Vesikari
et al [5], against mainly influenza A[H3N2]), the estimated absolute VE for Ad2 in our study is 86%; if an absolute VE for
plain H1N1 antigen of 59% is assumed (efficacy estimate
from the same influenza A[H1N1] antigen in a quadrivalent
formulation) [15], the estimated absolute VE for Ad2 is 90%,
which is consistent with short-term vaccine effectiveness estimates (86%–100%) reported in case-control studies involving
children and adults who received 1 dose of H1N1-AS03 [16–
18]. Adjuvant benefit in terms of immunogenicity, with higher
and more persistent immune responses, was also demonstrated
for 2 H1N1-AS03 doses over 2 nonadjuvanted vaccine doses,
consistent with findings from previous clinical trials [6, 19].
Evidence from multiple clinical trials indicates transient increase in injection site reactions following AS03-adjuvanted versus nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines, but there has been no
evidence of an increased incidence of medically attended events
or SAEs associated with AS03 use [7].Consistent with these studies, we observed higher rates of injection site pain in H1N1-AS03
recipients than in nonadjuvanted vaccine recipients. However,
grade 3 pain was reported for no more than 3.6% of children. Reported potential immune-mediated diseases were evenly distributed across groups. The incidence of mild fever increased after the
second H1N1-AS03 dose, as observed in other studies of this vaccine in healthy children [20]. There was no clustering of febrile
convulsion cases in temporal relationship to vaccination.
After commencement of our study, several retrospective studies suggested an association between vaccination with another
A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine (Pandemrix[TM]) and the subsequent
onset of narcolepsy in individuals <21 years of age and in adults

[21–31].These retrospective observational studies alone are insufficient to ascribe the risk solely to the vaccine, as other factors
may play a role. The recent identification of an epitope in the
H1N1 HA protein that mimics an epitope present within hypocretin [32] suggests that exposure of individuals with the HLA
DQ0602 allele to H1N1 can result in an autoimmune response
involving CD4[+] T cells that could lead to the onset of narcolepsy.
No narcolepsy cases were reported in the current study, which
was too small to detect rare events such as narcolepsy.


adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccines for control of future
pandemics with respect to prevention of disease in a particularly
vulnerable age segment. Similarly, the availability of effective adjuvanted influenza vaccines for children with reduced antigen
content could offer opportunities for improved control of seasonal influenza. However, in either the seasonal or pandemic setting,
use of AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccines associated with injection site symptoms, fever, and a theoretical risk of rarer events
will need to be balanced against the risk of death or severe illness
caused by the seasonal or pandemic influenza viral strains.
