### Summary
**Background** **Young children have immature immune systems and respond poorly to standard influenza vaccines.**
**The oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant MF59 can increase antigen uptake, macrophage recruitment, lymph node**
**migration, and avidity to influenza virus. Therefore, we aimed to assess the relative efficacy, immunogenicity, and**
**safety** **of an MF59-adjuvanted, quadrivalent, inactivated (subunit) influenza vaccine (aIIV4) compared with a**
**US-licensed non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in children.**

**Methods** **We did a multicentre, randomised controlled, observer-blinded, phase 3 trial of** **146 sites including hospitals,**
**clinics, and clinician offices** **in nine countries over two influenza seasons. We included children of either sex aged**
**6 months through 5 years. We stratified eligible participants and randomly assigned them (1:1), using a block size of four,**
**to receive either aIIV4 or non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (ie, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV3]**
**or quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV4]). We masked participants, parents or guardians, and outcome**
**assessors to the administered vaccine. Designated personnel who were not masked administered aIIV4 in both seasons,**
**or IIV3 in season one and IIV4 in season two. All vaccinations were administered intramuscularly. Children aged**
**6 through 35 months received one or two 0·25 mL doses, whereas those aged 3 through 5 years received one or two doses**
**of 0·5 mL. The number of doses was dependent on previous vaccination status: vaccine-naive participants received a total**
**of two doses of study vaccine, the first on day 1 and the second on day 29, whereas non-naive participants received only**
**one dose on day 1. The primary outcome was relative vaccine efficacy assessed by RT-PCR-confirmed influenza due to**
**any influenza strain in the overall study population and in prespecified age and dose subgroups.** **Immunogenicity against**
**homologous and heterologous strains of influenza and safety were also measured. This study is registered with**
**ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01964989.**

**Findings** **Between Nov 3, 2013, and March 5, 2014 (season one), and between Sept 30, 2014, and March 29, 2015**
**(season two), 10 644 participants were enrolled in this study. Of these participants, 10 612 were vaccinated (n=5338**
**with aIIV4 and n=5274 with comparator). Relative vaccine efficacy was not different between aIIV4 and the comparator**
**vaccines in the overall study population (relative vaccine efficacy –0·67, 95% CI –19·81 to 15·41). The relative vaccine**
**efficacy in the 6 through 23-month subgroup was significantly greater for aIIV4 than for the comparator vaccine**
**(relative vaccine efficacy 31·37, 95% CI 3·14–51·38). aIIV4 elicited superior immunogenic response compared with**
**the comparator for all four vaccine strains (geometric mean titre ratios 1·91 [95% CI 1·8–2·0] for A/H1N1,**
**1·71 [1·6–1·8] for A/H3N2, 2·19 [2·0–2·4] for B/Yamagata, and 2·27 [2·0–2·6] for B/Victoria) and three heterologous**
**strains (1·94 [1·6–2·3] for A/H3N2, 2·17 [1·8–2·6] for B/Yamagata, and 2·12 [1·6–2·7] for B/Victoria) in participants**
**aged 6 months through 5 years. The highest geometric mean titre ratios were observed in participants aged 6 through**
**23 months. Safety profiles were similar but more frequent solicited adverse events were reported with aIIV4 than with**
**the comparator (3748 [73%] of 5138 vs 3242 [64%] of 5056).**

**Interpretation** **Although there was no additional benefit of aIIV4 compared with the US-licensed non-adjuvanted**
**influenza vaccines in the overall study population, in the youngest and most vulnerable population of children in this**
**trial, aIIV4 provided greater protection against influenza than a non-adjuvanted vaccine when assessed in this**
**prespecified age group of 6 through 23 months. Additional clinical benefit was also apparent early after first**
**vaccination in vaccine-naive participants aged 6 months through 5 years. Finally, aIIV4 and comparator had similar**
**efficacy and vaccine safety profiles in children aged 6 months through 5 years.**

**Research in context**

**Evidence before this study**
We searched PubMed on Sept 5, 2017, using the search terms
“quadrivalent influenza vaccine” and “children” with no
restrictions to language or dates. Our search revealed
104 articles published between 2006 and 2017. Of these
articles, ten were classified as clinical trials assessing the efficacy,
immunogenicity, or safety of a quadrivalent vaccine in a
paediatric population. None of these studies examined
adjuvanted vaccines. We did a second PubMed search using the
terms “adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine” and
“children”, which identified 25 clinical trials published between
2004 and 2015. One of these studies examined the relative
efficacy of MF59-adjuvanted vaccine versus a non-adjuvanted
comparator in children. In that study, adjuvanted trivalent
inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3) was significantly more
efficacious than non-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza
vaccine (IIV3) against laboratory-confirmed influenza in
children aged 6 months through 5 years and in a subgroup aged
6 through 23 months.


**Added value of this study**
This study was done mainly during a season in which there
was a mismatch between the recommended vaccine
A/H3N2 strain and the predominantly circulating
A/H3N2 virus strain. Despite the mismatch, aIIV4 was
significantly more efficacious than the non-adjuvanted
vaccines in preventing influenza in children aged 6 through
23 months.

**Implications of all the available evidence**
Young children, particularly those younger than 2 years, have
immature immune systems that respond poorly to standard
influenza vaccines. In this study, aIIV4 offered an additional
benefit over currently licensed influenza vaccines in this age
group, which should be considered in public health
recommendations. However, no significant difference in vaccine
efficacy was shown for the overall study population
aged 6 months through 5 years.


the B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineages should similarly
enhance vaccine efficacy in children. Therefore, in this
phase 3 trial, we assessed the relative efficacy, immuno­
genicity, and safety of aIIV4 compared with a US-licensed
non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in children.

### Methods
#### Study design and participants
We did a multicentre, randomised controlled, observerblinded, phase 3 trial of 146 sites including hospitals,
clinics, and clinician offices in Finland, the USA, Canada,
Italy, Poland, Spain, Philippines, Thailand, and Taiwan.
We did the study over two influenza seasons. In the
northern hemisphere, the end of an influenza season was
considered as June 30, whereas in the tropical nations
(Philippines and Thailand) the season end was Oct 31.
The study was approved by either a central or local
institutional review board or ethics committee, and was
done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and
the International Council for Harmonisation Guideline
for Good Clinical Practice.
We included children of either sex aged 6 months
through 5 years who were healthy or at high risk of
complications from influenza. We excluded children
who had any medical condition meeting the definition of
an adverse event of special interest (appendix), any
seizure condition, or any fatal condition. The appendix
lists all inclusion and exclusion criteria. We obtained
written informed consent from the parents or legal
guardians, or both, of all participants before enrolment.

#### Randomisation and masking
We stratified eligible participants according to site,
vaccine dose risk status for influenza complications

### Introduction
Children are at increased risk for influenza-induced
morbidity and mortality,[1,2] and they have a major role in
the transmission of influenza during epidemics.[3,4] In an
average year, influenza affects approximately 13% of
children younger than 5 years, or roughly 90 million
children worldwide.[5,6] Influenza also accounts for 10% of
paediatric admissions to hospital for respiratory illnesses
and 2–7% of deaths in children younger than 5 years
annually, with the highest percentages among those
younger than 2 years.[7,8]

Vaccinating children against influenza not only directly
benefits children themselves but also helps prevent the
spread of influenza.[9] Unfortunately, currently licensed
trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3) often do
not elicit robust antibody responses in young children,
particularly against B strains. Meanwhile, two separate
B lineages (B/Victoria/2/87 and B/Yamagata/16/88) have
co-circulated during most influenza seasons since the
1980s.[10,11] Quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines
(IIV4) were developed containing both influenza B
lineages and might offer a potential advantage over
IIV3.[12,13]

The oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant MF59 (Seqirus,
formerly the influenza business of Novartis Vaccines and
Diagnostics) can increase antigen uptake, macrophage
recruitment, and lymph node migration.[14] MF59 also
increases the avidity of antibody binding to influenza
virus.[15] MF59-adjuvanted IIV3 (Fluad) showed increased
efficacy and antibody responses to homologous and
heterologous strains compared with non-adjuvanted
IIV3 in children.[16,17] An MF59-adjuvanted, quadrivalent,
inactivated (subunit) influenza vaccine (aIIV4) con­
taining strains from the two influenza A strains and both


-----

(see the appendix for these definitions), and historical
influenza vaccination status. For historical vaccination
status, only participants who reported less than
two doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since
July 1, 2010, were considered vaccine naive. Vaccination
history was based on previous documentation
(eg, a vaccination card) or through the parent’s or legal
guardian’s verbal recall if no such documentation was
available.
Additionally, we used a web-based interactive
response technology system to randomly assign
participants (1:1), using a block size of four, to receive
either aIIV4 or non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza
vaccine (ie, IIV3 or IIV4). Blocks were dynamically
assigned to the site strata, from a central block pool,
upon the first participant enrolment into the strata.
Subsequent participants enrolled into the site strata
were allocated to the next available treatment group in
the randomisation block. Randomisation lists were
generated by Oracle randomisation statisticians and
verified by the sponsor’s statisticians. Treatment lists
were generated by Fisher Clinical Services and verified
by the sponsor’s statisticians and the Clinical supply
department.
Site-specific blinding procedures were documented
before the study start. Therefore, we masked all site
personnel except those administering the vaccine
(ie, the nurse or physician), for which they had no role
in the assessment of the participants in the trial and
were instructed not to reveal the identity of the study
vaccines to the participants, parents or guardians, and
investigators or study nurses involved in the monitoring
or conduct of the study, except in an emergency. We also
masked the participants and parents or guardians to the
vaccine administered; for example, we requested them
to look the other way upon vaccination or by shielding
the syringe.
For the immunogenicity subgroup, we randomly
selected participants in a one-to-one ratio from the
two vaccine study groups, including both healthy
participants and those at high risk of influenza
complications. We also stratified the immunogenicity
subgroup by country, dose cohort, and vaccine status.

#### Procedures
We used aIIV4 (Seqirus, Rosia, Italy) and non-adjuvanted
inactivated influenza vaccine (ie, IIV3 or IIV4, both of
which are split virion type licensed products [Fluzone,
Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA, USA]). Fluzone IIV3 was
used as the comparator in season one because Fluzone
IIV4 did not receive approval from the US Food and
Drug Administration for use in children aged 6 months
or older until June, 2013, and insufficient amounts of
IIV4 were available the first season. Fluzone IIV4 was
used as the comparator in season two. The aIIV4 used in
seasons one and two, and IIV4 used in season
two contained a total haemagglutinin (HA) concentration


of 60 µg in the 0·5 mL dose and 30 µg in the 0·25 mL
dose, which consisted of 15 µg or 7·5 µg (depending on
dose) of HA from each influenza strain as recommended
by WHO for the northern hemisphere 2013–14
and 2014–15 seasons: A/H1N1 (A/California/7/2009
pdm09-like virus), A/H3N2 (A/Texas/50/2012),
B/Yamagata (B/Massachusetts/2/2012), and B/Victoria
(B/Brisbane/60/2008). The IIV3 comparator used in
season one contained 15 µg of HA in the 0·5 mL dose or
7·5 µg in the 0·25 mL dose from A/H1N1 and A/H3N2
as well as the B/Yamagata lineage, for a total of 45 µg in
the 0·5 mL dose or 22·5 µg in the 0·25 mL dose of HA in
the vaccine.
Children aged 6 through 35 months received one or
two 0·25 mL doses, whereas those aged 3 through 5 years
received one or two doses of 0·5 mL. The number of
doses was dependent on previous vaccination status:
vaccine-naive participants received a total of two doses of
study vaccine, the first on day 1 and the second on day 29,
whereas non-naive participants received only one dose
on day 1. All vaccinations were administered intra­
muscularly in the deltoid, except when the child did not
have sufficient deltoid mass in which case injections
were administered in the anterolateral thigh.
We did active surveillance for influenza-like illness
weekly via telephone contact or text message, or both,
or during planned clinic visits for 180 days after last
vaccination or until the end of the influenza season,
whichever was longer. Parents or guardians of the study
participants were instructed to report symptoms of
influenza-like illness to the study site and schedule a
clinic visit for nasopharyngeal swab collection,
preferably within 3 days or at least within 6 days after a
participant exhibited a body temperature of 37·8°C or
more and at least one of the following respiratory
symptoms: cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, or
runny nose. RT-PCR was used to confirm influenza
infection from naso­pharyngeal swab samples, which
were also cultured in parallel. The cultured virus was
analysed for antigenic characterisation by the University
of Rochester Vaccine Evaluation Unit (Rochester, NY,
USA) and by Viroclinics Biosciences BV (Rotterdam,
Netherlands). RT-PCR and culture tests were done at
Focus Diagnostics Clinical Trials (San Juan Capistrano,
CA, USA).
Strain antigenic typing was determined using
haemagglutination inhibition or microneutralisation
assays. For some A/H3N2 isolates, haemagglutination
inhibition was done with ferret antisera raised against
an exclusively cell-grown A/H3N2 and an eggpropagated A/H3N2 virus reference standard. For
A/H3N2 isolates that did not bind red blood cells but
could be grown, a standard microneutralisation assay
was done using egg-propagated A/H3N2 to both raise
ferret antisera and to serve as the reference standard.[18]
Matched strains were those with less than eight-fold
difference in titre and unmatched strains were those


-----

with eight-fold difference or more in titre compared
with the reference standard.
We assessed antibody responses with haemagglu­
tination inhibition assays using serum samples collected
before vaccination (day 1 for non-vaccine-naive
participants and days 1 and 29 for vaccine-naive
participants) and 21 days after the last vaccination
(day 22 for non-vaccine-naive participants and day 50 for
vaccine-naive participants). We also collected samples for
haemag­glutination inhibition titre measurement
6 months after the last vaccination (day 181 for nonvaccine-naive participants and day 209 for vaccine-naive
participants). Strains selected for heterologous
testing were A/Brisbane/59/2007 for A/H1N1, A/Hong
Kong/4801/2014 for A/H3N2, B/Phuket/3073/2013 for
B/Yamagata, and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 for B/Victoria.
From 6 h to day 7 after each vaccination, the
participant’s parent or guardian, or both, was instructed
to keep a daily record of specific local and systemic
adverse events. These solicited adverse events included
tenderness, erythema, induration, and ecchymosis at
the injection site, as well as irritability, sleepiness,
changed eating habits, vomiting, diarrhoea, chills, fever,
and the use of antipyretics or analgesics for prevention
or treatment of pain or fever, or both. Other adverse


events and associated medications were also tracked
from the day of vaccination until 21 days after the last
vaccination. Safety surveillance was done from the first
vaccination and continued until the termination visit,
which occurred on day 366 for non-vaccine-naive
participants and on day 390 for vaccine-naive
participants. Surveillance included adverse events of
special interest, which specifically focused on potentially
immune-mediated diseases (the appendix summarises
the full list of medical concepts), new-onset chronic
diseases, serious adverse events, and events leading to
study withdrawal.

#### Outcomes
The primary outcome was the relative vaccine efficacy of
aIIV4 versus non-adjuvanted vaccine (ie, IIV3 or IIV4)
based on RT-PCR-confirmed influenza cases occurring
between 21 days and 180 days (inclusive) after the last
vaccination or until the end of the influenza season,
whichever was longer, in participants aged 6 months
through 5 years. Early vaccine efficacy was assessed as the
relative vaccine efficacy at 7 days or more and 14 days or
more after the first but before the second dose of vaccine in
vaccine-naive participants as well as at 7 days or more and
21 days or less after the last vaccination, in all participants.

-----

Efficacy determinations in the first season were based on
A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B/Yamagata, the B lineage
common to aIIV4 and the IIV3 comparator. Children
infected with B/Victoria from season one were not
included in the efficacy analyses because this strain was
absent from the comparator vaccine in season one. Season
two efficacy assessments were made using all four virus
strains. We assessed all efficacy outcomes for all
participants in the following prespecified age and dose
cohorts: 6 through 23 months, 0·25 mL dose (6 through
35 months), and 0·5 mL dose (3 through 5 years). A posthoc analysis assessed relative vaccine efficacy in
participants aged 2 through 5 years, irrespective of dose.
Secondary efficacy outcomes included culture-confirmed
influenza regardless of antigenic match, and antigenically
matched and unmatched strains in the same timeframe as
the primary efficacy outcome.
Secondary immunogenicity outcomes included assess­
ment of geometric mean titres (GMT) at baseline, before
first vaccination, and 3 weeks and 6 months after final
vaccination in all participants. In vaccine-naive
participants who received two doses, immunogenicity
was also assessed 4 weeks after first vaccination. The
ratios of GMT values for aIIV4 versus non-adjuvanted
vaccine were also determined at each timepoint. Data
from 3 weeks after final vaccination in naive and
non-naive participants were pooled. We pooled data from
seasons one and two because the same strains were
included in the vaccine. The vaccine-group difference in
the percentage of those achieving seroconversion was
assessed; seroconversion was defined as a postvaccination haemagglutination inhibition titre of 1:40
for participants who were negative at baseline
(haemagglutination inhibition <1:10) or a minimum fourfold increase in haemagglutination inhibition titre for
those who were positive at baseline (≥1:10). Antibody
responses were also evaluated according to the Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research criteria (appendix).
The proportion of participants with haemag­glutination
in­hibition titres of 1:110 or more, 1:151 or more, 1:215 or
more, 1:330 or more, and 1:629 or more was also evaluated
at the same timepoints outlined above.[19] Subgroup
analyses were preplanned for the immunogenicity
endpoints for the same age and dose cohorts as for
efficacy. A post-hoc analysis was done for children
aged 2 through 5 years.
Safety and tolerability were assessed in terms of the
percentage of participants with adverse events. Any
other outcome or subgroup analyses as specified in the
protocol but not listed here were not included in this
manuscript.

#### Statistical analysis
Sample size and power considerations for the primary
aIIV4 efficacy objective were based on data extracted
from a previous efficacy study of adjuvanted IIV3
(aIIV3) in paediatric participants [20] This study was


planned with a group-sequential design. Assuming a
relative vaccine efficacy of 36% and an influenza event
rate of 2·50% in the non-adjuvanted comparator group,
the sample size of approximately 8124 evaluable
participants aged 6 months through 5 years for both
vaccine groups, with a number of 323 influenza events,
predicted about 97·5% power for the adjusted 2·02%
level one-sided log-rank test for equality of survival

curves to detect the difference between the two groups.
Assuming a 15% dropout of participants, approximately
9558 participants were to be enrolled for each vaccine
group. As per protocol, at a number of 323 RT-PCRconfirmed cases, a final analysis for efficacy was to be
done. This number was reached at the interim analysis
done by an independent data monitoring committee at
the end of season two. Therefore, no further participants
were enrolled in a subsequent season.
Relative vaccine efficacy was defined as
1 – HR = 1 – λaIIV4(t) / λComparator(t), in which HR is the hazard
ratio and λ(t) is the hazard rates of each vaccine group,
which was further defined as λ(t) = f(t) / S(t) for which f(t)
is the rate of first-occurrence RT-PCR-confirmed in­
fluenza events per unit time (t) and S(t) is the survival
function (ie, function of time without influenza events).
The HRs and related 95% CIs for onset of
RT-PCR-confirmed influenza were estimated by a Cox
proportional hazards regression model with treatment
effect as a main effect and stratifying covariates (season,
vaccine naivety, dose group, high risk of influenza
complications, and country) as random effects. Success
for superiority was specified as relative vaccine efficacy of
aIIV4 versus comparator with a lower bound of the
95% CI more than 0. An exploratory test for heterogeneity


(Breslow-Day test) for the con­sistency of first-occurrence
RT-PCR-confirmed relative vaccine efficacy across age
subgroups (6 through 23 months and 2 through 5 years)
was done post hoc.
For the immunogenicity outcomes, aIIV4 was
considered superior if the lower boundary of the
two-sided 95% CI for the ratio of GMTaIIV4 to GMTComparator
for haemagglutination inhibition antibody was more
than one and the lower boundary of the two-sided
95% CI for the difference of percentages of participants
seroconverted for haemag­glutination inhibition antibody
was more than 0%.
The efficacy full analysis set comprised all participants
who received study vaccine and provided efficacy data.
For the immunogenicity analyses, the full analysis set
population included all participants who received study
vaccine and who provided at least one evaluable serum
sample both before (baseline) and after vaccination. The
per-protocol set included all study participants and
associated data from the full analysis set who were not
excluded for reasons prespecified before unmasking.
The safety analysis set included all participants who were
exposed to the study vaccine and provided safety data. We
did all statistical analyses using SAS (version 9.3). This
study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number

### Results
Season one enrolment occurred between Nov 3, 2013,
and March 5, 2014, and season two enrolment between
Sept 30, 2014, and March 29, 2015. A total of
10 644 participants were enrolled in this study
(1486 in 2013–14 [season one] and 9158 in 2014–15

[season two]). Of these participants randomly assigned
to the two groups, 5338 were vaccinated with aIIV4 and
5274 were vaccinated with the comparator vaccine across
the two seasons (figure 1). 2686 (25·2%) of 10 644 were
younger than 2 years. The immunogenicity subset
included all participants enrolled in season one and 1770
from season two; in total, 1481 participants were assigned
to receive aIIV4 and 1405 to receive the comparator
vaccine. The number of enrolled participants varied by
sites from one to 476 and most participants were

enrolled from the USA (n=4508), Philippines (n=2273),
and Thailand (n=2040).
In both the efficacy and immunogenicity full analysis
set, demographic and baseline characteristics were
similar between vaccine groups, including the proportion
of participants with baseline haemagglutination
inhibition titres of less than 1:10 and 1:40 or more
(table 1). The number of vaccine-naive participants with a
baseline haemagglutination inhibition titre of less than
1:10 against H3N2 was 451 (49%) of 922 participants who
received aIIV4 and 443 (51%) of 866 who received the
comparator (table 1). By contrast, the number of
participants aged 6 through 23 months who had a
baseline haema­gglutination inhibition titre of less than
1:10 against H3N2 was 282 (66%) of 428 for those who
received aIIV4 versus 280 (66%) of 427 for those who
received the comparator. In total, 2235 (84%) of
2673 participants aged 6 through 23 months received two
doses of vaccine versus 4642 (58%) of 7939 aged 2 through
5 years.
A total of 508 cases of first-occurrence RT-PCRconfirmed influenza occurred during the study; ten
during season one and 498 during season two. There
was no difference between aIIV4 and the comparator in
the prevention of RT-PCR-confirmed influenza in
partici­pants aged 6 months through 5 years (relative
vaccine efficacy –0·67 95% CI –19·81 to 15·41; table 2)


Although there were differences in attack rate between
the countries, there was no difference in relative vaccine
efficacy by country (data not shown). Similar results
were observed for culture-confirmed influenza
regardless of antigenic match (table 2; appendix).
Among participants with first-occurrence RT-PCRconfirmed influenza, 34 (0·8%) of 4521 participants
from the aIIV4 group and 32 (0·7%) of 4494 from the
comparator group had moderate-to-severe influenza,
and the relative vaccine efficacy was –4·78 (95% CI
–70·23 to 35·51; appendix). Using the antigenic typing
assays, more than half of A/H3N2 strains from season
two were determined to be antigenically distinct from
egg-propagated A/Texas/50/2012, the H3N2 vaccine
strain.
In participants aged 6 through 23 months, the relative
vaccine efficacy of aIIV4 against RT-PCR-confirmed
influenza was significantly more than the comparator
vaccine (31·37, 95% CI 3·14–51·38; table 3). Relative
vaccine efficacy for aIIV4 was higher in those aged
6 through 23-months against culture-confirmed
influenza from any strain and culture-confirmed
matched cases than for the comparator, although
differences were not significant (table 3). The exploratory
Breslow-Day test and a test for interaction for
heterogeneity across age group strata suggested that age
was an effect modifier (p=0·023) The appendix includes

data for the relative vaccine efficacy of aIIV4 for the two
dose groups (0·25 mL and 0·5 mL), and shows that for
both subgroups the relative vaccine efficacy of aIIV4 is
similar to the comparator vaccine. Kaplan-Meier curves
for time until first-occurrence RT-PCR-confirmed in­
fluenza in participants aged 6 months through 5 years
and those aged 6 through 23 months are shown in the
appendix.
In vaccine-naive participants aged 6 months through
5 years, the relative vaccine efficacy was 5·80 (95% CI
–16·91 to 24·10). In an assessment of early efficacy
in these participants the relative vaccine efficacy


was 54·66 (95% CI 18·08–74·91) between 7 days after the
first dose and the time of the second dose, and was
70·56 (35·19–86·62) 14 days or more after the first dose
until the second vaccination (table 4). Additionally,
regardless of previous vaccination status, fewer
participants who received aIIV4 were diagnosed with
influenza between 7 days and 21 days after the last
vaccination compared with the comparator (four _vs_ 15;
table 4).
In the overall study population, aIIV4 elicited a robust
post-vaccination immune response. As shown in
figure 2, the lower limit of the confidence interval of
GMT ratios for all homologous strains 21 days after last
vaccination was 1·3 or more, demonstrating superiority,
and the highest GMT ratios against all homologous
strains were observed in participants aged 6 through 23
months compared with other age groups. In vaccinenaive participants, the GMTs for homologous A/H1N1
and A/H3N2 after a single dose of aIIV4 were similar to
the GMTs after two doses of the comparator vaccine
(appendix). Additionally, the GMT ratios after a single
dose ranged from 2·00 (95% CI 1·8–2·3) for B/Yamagata
to 2·80 (2·5–3·2) for A/H1N1 (appendix).
At 180 days after the last vaccination, the GMTs were
higher in the aIIV4 group than in the comparator vaccine
group for all homologous strains in all age groups. GMT
ratios ranged from 1·57 (95% CI 1·4–1·7) for A/H3N2 to
1·86 (1·7–2·0) for A/H1N1 and B/Yamagata.
aIIV4 was superior to comparator vaccine in sero­
conversion for all homologous strains 21 days after last
vaccination in all participants (appendix). The Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research criteria for sero­
conversion were met by all participants receiving aIIV4
and comparator across the overall groups as well as age
and dose subgroups (appendix).
Consistent with greater relative vaccine efficacy in
participants aged 6 through 23 months, 40·3% more of
participants receiving aIIV4 than those receiving
comparator achieved a haemagglutination inhibition titre
of 1:629 or more against the homologous A/H3N2 strain;
whereas the percentage difference was 13·0% for those
aged 2 through 5 years. The same trends in differences in
percentages of participants reaching the specified threshold
titres were observed for the other vaccine strains (figure 3).
The GMTs for the heterologous strains for the A/H3N2
and the B strains were higher for aIIV4 than for the
comparator vaccine group 21 days after the last
vaccination (appendix). For the heterologous A/H3N2
and B strains, the percentages of participants with
seroconversion and haemagglutination inhibition titre of
1:40 or more were higher in the aIIV4 group than in the
comparator vaccine group (appendix). Most importantly,
the immunogenicity of aIIV4 was significantly greater
against the heterologous (egg-propagated) A/Hong
Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2) strain than the comparator.
Similar to the other efficacy and immunogenicity
analyses the highest GMT ratios were observed in

participants aged 6 through 23 months for all influenza
strains except heterologous A/H1N1 (appendix). The
heterologous A/H1N1 strain, from the period before the
2009 pandemic, showed low responses with both aIIV4
and the comparator vaccine.
In the overall population, the incidence of any
solicited adverse event was higher in participants who
received aIIV4 than in those who received the
comparator vaccine (3748 [73%] of 5138 vs 3242 [64%] of
5056; appendix) Most solicited adverse events were


mild to moderate in severity, and most reported fevers
were less than 39°C. The appendix shows the numbers
and proportions of participants with solicited and
unsolicited adverse events. Despite absolute differences
in the proportions of participants reporting adverse
events in younger and older children, the relative
distribution between the vaccine groups was consistent
across the age groups. A greater proportion of
participants in the aIIV4 group than in the nonadjuvanted vaccine group reported tenderness fever

(≥38°C), or use of analgesic or anti­pyretic agents
(appendix).
The proportion of participants who reported any un­
solicited adverse event was similar for the aIIV4 and the
comparator vaccine groups (3576 [68%] of 5243 _vs_
3543 [69%] of 5161; appendix). A similar pattern was
also observed for possibly related adverse events, any
unsolicited serious adverse events, adverse events of
special interest, unsolicited adverse events leading to
death, unsolicited adverse events leading to withdrawal
from the study or vaccine, admissions to hospital, and
new-onset chronic disease for all age groups. The most
commonly reported unsolicited adverse events in either
vaccine group were influenza-like illness and upper
respiratory tract infection (appendix). Nine adverse
events of special interest occurred in the study: five in
participants who received aIIV4 and four in those who
received the comparator; however, none were
considered to be related to the vaccine by the study
investigators.

### Discussion
Our study, in which aIIV4 and the comparator were
administered at a 0·25 mL dose in children aged less
than 3 years, showed that aIIV4 had significantly greater
efficacy in preventing influenza versus a comparator
without an adjuvant in children aged 6 through
23 months, and similar efficacy in older children, with
age emerging as a significant effect modifier. The
immune response to vaccination with aIIV4 was superior
across all ages, with significantly greater GMT ratios
and seroconversion against both homologous and
heterologous strains relative to the comparator. The
difference in immune response was greatest in children
younger than 2 years compared with older children. After
vaccination with aIIV4, more children achieved a
haemagglutination inhibition titre threshold of 1:629
or more, which was previously associated with
90% protection against influenza in children,[19] and this
enhancement was most apparent in children aged
6 through 23 months. These age-related differences in the
immune response to vaccination provide a biologically
plausible rationale for the increase in efficacy seen in
younger children.
aIIV4 had greater relative vaccine efficacy after a single
dose but before the second vaccine dose in children
considered vaccine-naive to previous vaccination, a
finding supported by higher GMTs seen after the first
dose of aIIV4 versus comparator. This result has
implications for children who have not been previously
vaccinated or exposed to influenza, especially when
vaccines are administered late in the influenza season or
the season starts early. In routine paediatric practice,
many vaccine-naive children receive only a single
vaccination.[21]

Overall, the safety profiles of the aIIV4 and comparator
vaccine were similar except for a greater incidence of


solicited adverse events reported by participants who
received aIIV4, most of which were mild to moderate in
severity and of short duration. A greater proportion of
children in the aIIV4 group reported tenderness
(most cases were assessed as mild to moderate in
severity) and fever (most <39°C). The increased reports
of solicited adverse events in aIIV4 are consistent with
the study of aIIV3 in this age group.[20] The proportion of
participants who reported unsolicited adverse events,
including serious adverse events, new-onset chronic
disease, and adverse events of special interest, were
similar between the two vaccine groups.
It is important to consider why the results of this
study are different from an earlier study that showed
greater vaccine efficacy after vaccination with aIIV3 in
children aged 6 months through 5 years.[20] The ages of
children enrolled in the two studies were similar;
however, all children in the earlier trial were considered
naive with regard to previous influenza vaccination,
whereas children who had been previously vaccinated
were included in the current study. Consequently, all
participants in the earlier trial received two doses of
aIIV3 or IIV3, but those in the current study received
either one or two doses of aIIV4 or either IIV3 or IIV4.
In the current study, nearly half of the children had
baseline haemagglutination inhibition titres of 1:40 or
more against either A/H1N1 or A/H3N2, which was
more than twice the percentage in the previous aIIV3
study. In the earlier study, the proportion of children
with baseline haemagglutination inhibition titres of 1:40
or more in those aged 6 months through 5 years against
all three vaccine strains was similar to that of children
aged 6 through 23 months in the current study. The
differences in study population might explain the
greater GMT ratios favouring aIIV3 seen in the earlier
study compared with the GMT ratios favouring aIIV4 in
the current study. In this trial, age was more closely
associated with immunological naivety than the
historical assessment of vaccine naivety in the overall
study population and might explain why additional
clinical benefit was shown in the youngest age group
but not in naive children of all ages. MF59 increases the
magnitude of immune response to vaccination with
influenza, and this effect was most evident in children
at any age with low baseline haemagglutination
inhibition titres to the strain of virus in the vaccine. The
different findings in the two studies might therefore be
explained by differences in previous exposure to
influenza and are consistent with the proposed
mechanism of action of MF59 in infants, which skews
the immune system towards a more mature immune
response.[22,23]

Another explanation for the differences in the results
of the two studies is the epidemiology of influenza
during the seasons when the trials were done. Most
influenza cases in the earlier trial were caused by a
virus strain that was antigenically similar to the strain


-----

used in the vaccine. The relative efficacy of aIIV3
compared with IIV3 (Influsplit) was 75% (95% CI
55–87) in children aged 6 months through 5 years and
73% (29–90) in those aged 6 through 23 months.[20] By
contrast, the majority of influenza cases in the current
trial were reported during the 2014–15 season, when
the predominant circulating virus was a strain of
A/H3N2 that was antigenically distinct from the
vaccine strain. In the setting of substantial antigenic
drift, which occurred during the current study, we
hypo­thesise that MF59 was particularly effective at
enhancing the vaccine response in the youngest
children because they were immunologically naive to
influenza. This apparent cross-protection in our
current trial is supported by evidence of epitope
spreading shown in earlier studies of an MF59adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine.[24]

A limitation to the current study is that most children
were enrolled in one season, and the overwhelming
majority of influenza cases included in the final
analysis was derived from this single season, in which
the most prominent circulating strain (A/H3N2) was
antigenically distinct from the vaccine strain. Despite
this disadvantage, aIIV4 was still more effective than
the comparator in preventing influenza in the youngest
age group. Although this subgroup was a prespecified
objective in the trial, multiplicity adjustment for
type I error was not accounted for in the statistical
design. However, tests for interaction (Breslow-Day
test and a proportional hazards regression that used
age as an interaction term) returned significant p
values; therefore, age was a modifier of the vaccine
effect, and analyses by age subgroups are a necessary
consideration.
In conclusion, this study showed that aIIV4 provided
significantly superior efficacy and immunogenicity than
a non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in a prespecified
age group of children aged 6 through 23 months, and
superior immunogenicity and similar safety profile in
all children aged 6 months through 5 years. The broader
and more persistent immune response to aIIV4 versus
comparator in the youngest children and those without
previous influenza vaccination are consistent with past
studies of MF59-adjuvanted seasonal and pandemic
influenza vaccines in young children.[12,20] Furthermore,
the differences between the current study and the earlier
study of aIIV3 offer important insight into the
mechanism of action of MF59 in the context of the
developing immune system. Despite the poor effect­
iveness of licensed vaccines in 2014–15 attributed to
substantial antigenic drift, aIIV4 had greater efficacy
in the youngest, most vulnerable population during
this period.
