### Introduction

Routine annual influenza immunization of children is recommended in the USA and Finland where nearly half of children
who are hospitalized for influenza were previously healthy, without recognized risk factors.[1-5] Similarly, 40% of fatal influenza
cases in children occur in previously healthy children.[6] These
characteristics of pediatric influenza support the universal use of
influenza vaccine in children at an early age with annual
revaccinations.
Although the medical need for routine influenza immunization in children is clear, available vaccines have limitations; trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV) have less than optimal
efficacy and live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) has restrictions for children under 24 months years of age because of safety
concerns.[7–9] While TIV may be »40–60% efficacious in children under 6 years old, there is no clear evidence for efficacy in
the youngest age group, 6–23 month-olds.[8,9] LAIV has been
shown to be more efficacious than TIV in 2–7 year-olds, but


cannot be used in children under 5 years of age who have a history of wheezing, and not at all in children under 24 months of
age.[7,10]

The use of adjuvants such as MF59 can significantly enhance
the immune response in previously unvaccinated children, with
protective antibodies levels being achieved earlier and lasting longer than with non-adjuvanted TIV.[11,12] MF59 also stimulates a
broader immune response that may provide for increased efficacy
�
against heterovariant strains.[13-15] MF59 (Novartis Vaccines)
was the first oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant included in a licensed
vaccine, the adjuvanted seasonal TIV (aTIV) indicated for older
adults (Fluad� Novartis Vaccines).16,17

We previously demonstrated in a head to head trial in vaccinena€ıve 6–71 month old children (conducted principally in the
2007–2008 season) that aTIV had 86% efficacy in preventing
laboratory-confirmed influenza while confirming in the same trial
the modest efficacy of TIV, at 42%.[11] This phase 3b extension
study was conducted to assess the safety and immunogenicity of

children from the previous efficacy trial, now at 30– 96 months
of age.[11] The 2009 H1N1 pandemic prevented us from evaluating the vaccination response in the season immediately following
the efficacy trial. All subjects who received either seasonal or
monovalent pandemic vaccine in 2009 were excluded in this
study analysis, in order to more clearly demonstrate the immune
response of re-vaccination in the first follow-up seasonal vaccination after priming. The vaccine strains in 2010–2011 [A/ California/7/2009 (H1N1), A/ Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/
60/2008 (Victoria)] were antigenically distinct from those in the
priming vaccine in 2008–2009 [A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1),
A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2), and B/Florida/4/2006 (Yamagata)], providing us with the opportunity to examine prime to
boost responses in young children following a change in B antigens, from B/Yamagata lineage to B/Victoria lineage strain.

### Results

Subjects
Fewer subjects were enrolled in the extension study than the
originally planned 1970 subjects, due to parental concerns in


Finland with narcolepsy associated with an AS03-adjuvanted
H1N1 vaccine that was used in several European countries
including Finland during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.[18]

In total, 197 subjects were enrolled and were categorized into
2 age cohorts, 6 -< 36 months (n D 29) and 36 -< 96 months
(n D 168). The younger age group was too small to draw conclusions on the immune response so the age cohorts were combined
and results were grouped by vaccine received. Of the 197 subjects
that were enrolled and randomized to receive aTIV (n D 135)
and TIV (n D 62), 188 completed the study. Reasons for premature withdrawal were withdrawal of consent (N D 4) and loss to
follow-up (N D 5) (Fig. 1). To more clearly demonstrate the
immune responses to vaccination in follow-up seasonal vaccination after priming, all subjects who received influenza vaccine in
2009, seasonal or monovalent pandemic, were excluded from the
immunogenicity and safety analyses presented in this report. Ultimately, 40 children revaccinated with aTIV, 26 children revaccinated with TIV, and 10 control children receiving influenza
vaccine for the first time (and were administered aTIV) were
included in the analyses for this study (Fig. 1).

Immunogenicity analyses
Evaluation of immunogenicity criteria according to European
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)
criteria is presented in Figure 2. Subjects who were primed with
aTIV and TIV and vaccinated with aTIV in the extension study
met all 3 CHMP criteria for seroprotection (>70%), seroconversion (>40%) and geometric mean ratio (GMR) (>2.5) against
the 3 homologous strains with persistence up to 6 months following vaccination. Subjects who were primed with TIV and vaccinated with aTIV or TIV in the extension study met all 3
CHMP criteria against A/California/7/2009 (A/H1N1) and A/
Perth/16/2009 (A/H3N2) and 2 out of 3 criteria (vaccination
aTIV) and 1 out of 3 criteria (vaccination TIV) against B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria). Children who were previously vaccinated with non-influenza control vaccine and vaccinated with
aTIV met all CHMP criteria except for seroprotection against B/
Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria) at Day 22. When using Center for
Biologics Evaluation & Research (CBER) criteria, only the subjects who were primed with aTIV and revaccinated with aTIV


met both CBER criteria for seroconversion and seroprotection at
Day 22 (Fig. 2).
Percentages of subjects achieving a more stringent cut-off
criterion hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer �110 are presented in Figure 3. In children primed with aTIV, HI titers
�110 at Day 22 were achieved in 94% (A/H1N1), 100% (A/
H3N2) and 69% (B/Brisbane/60/2008) after vaccination with
aTIV and 75% (A/H1N1), 100% (A/H3N2) and 58% (B/
Brisbane/60/2008) following vaccination with TIV. In TIVprimed children, the proportion achieving HI titres of �110
were 91%, 100% and 22% (vaccination aTIV) and 100%,
71% and 0% (vaccination TIV) against A/H1N1, A/H3N2
and B strains, respectively. In children previously vaccinated
with non-influenza control and vaccinated with aTIV, 89%
achieved a titer �110 to A/H1N1, 100% to H3N2 and 33%
to B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage).
Day 181 HI titers �110 were achieved in 24–100% and
8–100% in children after vaccination with aTIV and TIV,
respectively (Fig. 3).

Antibody responses by subtype

H1N1
Although subjects who received the 2009 pandemic vaccine
were excluded from this analysis, baseline titers in all 3 groups
suggested that pandemic exposure had occurred relatively uniformly in all groups, with geometric mean titers (GMTs) in the
range of 33 to 59. All groups responded well to their first vaccination against A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) irrespective of having
received adjuvanted, non-adjuvanted or no previous influenza
vaccine in the earlier study, with 12.6 to 27.9 fold increases in
response to aTIV and 9.7 to 24.2 fold increases in response to
TIV. Six months later, higher titers, in the range of 1.3 to 1.4
fold higher, were maintained in the aTIV- compared to TIV-vaccinated children (Table 2).

H3N2
Baseline antibody titers were 2.3 to 5.8 fold higher in children who had previously received aTIV compared to children
who had been vaccinated originally with TIV. However, better
persistence of the antibody-induced response in the aTIVprimed group cannot be inferred because control children who
had not previously received influenza vaccine had evidence of
baseline H3N2 antibodies at even higher levels, presumably
deriving from natural infection. Children primed with aTIV
and those who had received control vaccines (and who had evidence of natural infection) responded to aTIV with a 10.4 to
14.3 fold rise to a GMT of~2200 at Day 22. Children who had
been primed with TIV and then boosted with aTIV exhibited a
17.7 fold rise, though to a lower absolute GMT of 1205 as their
baseline titer after TIV priming was lower. The other mixed
regimen of aTIV followed by TIV produced an intermediate
rise of 4.5 fold to a GMT of 678, while successive TIV vaccinations produced the lowest GMT of 328, albeit as a result of a


13.1 fold rise. aTIV vaccinated children maintained a 2.7 fold
higher GMT compared to TIV vaccinated children at
6 months. The GMT of the aTIV-aTIV group (925) was 7.7
fold higher than the TIV-TIV group (120) at that point
(Table 2).

B
Baseline titers to the Victoria lineage B/Brisbane/60/2008
strain were uniformly low in all groups, including those who had
been primed with 2 vaccine doses in 2008–2009, as that formulation contained a B/Yamagata lineage strain. The children who
had been primed with TIV and were revaccinated with TIV
mounted a suboptimal response against the B/Victoria lineage
antigen from GMT 5 (pre-vaccination) to GMT 20 (Day 22
post-vaccination) and GMT 17 (Day 181 post-vaccination). In
contrast, aTIV-primed children responded with at least 10-fold
rises to the B/Victoria lineage antigen, achieving GMTs of 160
and 95 on Day 22, whether they were revaccinated with adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted vaccine, respectively, with persistence
of higher GMTs (135 and 94) up to 6 months following vaccination. The six month GMT of the aTIV-aTIV group was almost
8-fold higher than that of the TIV-TIV group. The responses of
the TIV-primed children were intermediate and reached a low
level of <40. In unprimed control subjects, who received aTIV
in their first influenza vaccination, GMTs at Day 22 and 181
were 74 and 178, respectively. Moderately high responses to the
B/Yamagata lineage strain following the initial 2 doses of adjuvanted vaccine indicated priming for the B/Victoria lineage antigen, whereas this was not observed following primary vaccination
with TIV. A single vaccination dose of aTIV in the latter subjects
compensated to some degree but the cross-lineage titers remained
lower than those in children primed with adjuvanted vaccine
(Table 2).

Safety
Local and systemic adverse reactions across the vaccine groups,
by priming vaccine are summarized in Table 3 (6-<36 months)
and Table 4 (36-<96 months). Overall, reactogenicity of aTIV
was slightly higher than for TIV, though not to a marked or clinically unacceptable extent. The majority of children reported at
least one reactogenicity sign post-vaccination. Reactions were
transient and mostly mild to moderate in severity. In the 6<36 months cohort, the most common reported local reaction
was tenderness with no reports of severe reactions. Most frequent
reported systemic reactions were unusual crying and irritability.
There was one report of severe fever �39.3[�]C in the youngest


age group following vaccination with TIV. In the age group 36<96 months, the most common reported local reaction was
injection site pain reported in 67% to 92% across vaccination
groups. There were no reports of severe local reactions. The most
commonly reported systemic reaction was fatigue, followed by
myalgia. There were 2 reports of severe systemic adverse events
(AEs) in subjects receiving aTIV (headache and malaise) and 1
report of severe systemic AE in a subject receiving TIV (myalgia).
Fever �37.3[�]C occurred in up to 14% of subjects across groups,
with no reports of severe fever.
Spontaneously reported AEs were comparable across vaccine
groups, regardless of priming vaccine in the parent study or

vaccination with aTIV or TIV. Overall, 59–75% of subjects
across groups experienced any unsolicited reaction, of which 17–
18% was considered at least possibly related. One subject receiving aTIV experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) (snake bite),
considered as not related to study vaccination. There were no
deaths and no AEs leading to premature study discontinuation.
In the subpopulation of children that received pandemic
AS03-adjuvanted vaccine in 2009, similar trends were observed
for immunogenicity and safety outcomes (Tables S1 and S2).

### Discussion

Routine influenza vaccination in children, beginning at
6 months of age, is increasingly recommended as children and
infants experience the highest rates of seasonal influenza infection
and hospitalisation.[1-4] We previously showed in a head to head
trial in vaccine-na€ıve 6–71 month old children that aTIV was
86% efficacious in preventing PCR-confirmed influenza, compared with 42% for TIV.[11] Moreover, aTIV was efficacious in
every age subgroup (96% in 36–71 months olds, 81% in 6–
35 months olds, and 75% in 6–23 months olds) at efficacy rates
that are in the range expected for a routinely administered childhood vaccine.[11] The MF59-adjuvanted vaccine was also well tolerated and in an integrated analysis of 1181 children who
received aTIV in clinical trials no pattern of associated serious
AEs was demonstrated.[16] Because influenza vaccine must be
administered annually, if aTIV was to be used in national schedules, data on its immunological advantage as well as its tolerability and safety upon repeated vaccination are needed.
Here we report the results of an extension study of vaccination
with aTIV versus TIV in children now aged 30–96 months,
whose only influenza vaccination had been in the previous efficacy trial 2 years earlier. The 2009 pandemic prevented us from
assessing the vaccination response in the season immediately following the efficacy trial. To examine the immune responses of
vaccination in the first follow-up seasonal vaccination after priming, we excluded all subjects who received either seasonal or pandemic vaccination in 2009 from the study analyses. Therefore,
only small datasets could be analyzed, which should be taken
into consideration in interpreting the results.
The results of this study demonstrate that the aTIV-aTIV
sequence produced 6.8-fold and 8-fold higher antibody responses
to A/H3N2 and B strains, respectively, than the reference TIVTIV regimen (referring to the vaccination given in the efficacy
study and the current study, respectively), but not to A/H1N1
strain. Also, for A/H3N2 and B strains, primary vaccination with
aTIV was found to be more immunogenic than 2 consecutive
vaccinations with TIV.
The magnitude of the difference between aTIV-aTIV and
TIV-TIV regimen was especially important for influenza B where
TIV-TIV provided only a GMT of 20 (Day 22) in the second
year while for aTIV-aTIV, the GMT response on Day 22 was
160. For the mixed regimens of aTIV-TIV or TIV-aTIV, the
advantage of aTIV in the second year varied with viral subtype,
as inferred from elevated baseline GMTs to that viral subtype.


For example, the elevated baseline titers and responses to the pandemic H1N1 component in aTIV were similar, irrespective of
whether the children had been primed with aTIV, TIV or had
had no prior influenza vaccination at all. The uniformly elevated
baseline titers in all subjects suggested similar experiences with
the pandemic infection in all groups and because the 2008–2009
influenza vaccine contained an H1N1 strain that was so highly
divergent from the pandemic H1N1 strain, it provided no additional detectable priming to the naturally-acquired pandemic
infection upon H1N1pnd09 immunisation.[19,20] Those titers
were »2-fold higher in the aTIV compared with TIV recipients
irrespective of priming history, demonstrating the impact of the
adjuvant. However, the sample sizes were small and the confidence intervals between aTIV and TIV overlapped, therefore the
difference was not significant.
A similar but more complex pattern was seen in response to
the H3N2 antigen against which the aTIV-primed children,
and the control children who received aTIV for the first time
had similarly elevated baseline and post-vaccination responses
to the H3N2 antigen. It is not possible to discriminate
whether the elevated baseline titer in the aTIV group may
have reflected a declining antibody titer from vaccination
2 years earlier or an intervening H3N2 infection or both.
These responses were higher than in the other groups. In the
TIV-aTIV children poorer persistence of antibody after priming and, possibly, a lower rate of naturally acquired infection
in the intervening year (reflected in a lower baseline GMT)
led to an intermediate response to the vaccination with aTIV.
In contrast, vaccination with TIV in the aTIV-TIV group led
to a lower GMT response, though the group had a similar
baseline antibody titer, indicating again, the impact of the
adjuvant in the vaccination vaccine. Finally, the TIV-TIV
group, whose baseline titers were the lowest, had the lowest
response to vaccination.
The response to the B/Victoria lineage antigen in the second
year vaccination (while the first vaccine contained a B/Yamagata
lineage antigen) showed that aTIV primed with the B/Yamagata
lineage antigen boosted the secondary antibody response against
the opposing lineage (GMTs 160 for aTIV, 95 for aTIV-TIV),
whereas, as noted previously, TIV did not (GMTs 38 for TIVaTIV and 20 for TIV-TIV).[21] However, as cross priming in the
other direction was not studied, it would be inappropriate to
speculate about cross-lineage responses in general. The cross-lineage priming associated with aTIV, though of great interest, is
perhaps moot from a public health perspective, as quadrivalent
formulations containing antigens from both B lineages are
becoming the new standard for children. We also reconfirmed
the phenomenon of original antigenic sin – at least in the direction of stronger responses to a first exposure to B/Yamagata antigen – with stronger responses to the priming B/Yamagata lineage
antigen that had been administered 2 years earlier, compared to
the response to the more recently administered B/Victoria lineage
antigen.[22,23]

The maintenance of elevated antibodies at high levels for
6 months by the regimen of repeated aTIV administration is of
practical importance as annual vaccination campaigns in the


-----

Northern Hemisphere now begin in August while the peak
month of influenza transmission is in February.[24] And in areas of
the world where influenza viral transmission is sustained for longer intervals or maintained throughout the calendar year, antibodies induced by a single annual vaccination ideally would
persist at protective levels for up to a year.[25]

The lower absolute levels of HI antibodies to the vaccinematched and variant B strains, compared with the A subtype
responses should be interpreted in the context of the low sensitivity of the HI assay in detecting antibodies to the B vaccine component.[26] Compared to HI test results, neutralizing antibody
titers elicited by the inactivated vaccine generally are higher and
are equally high for B and A components.[27,28]

Vaccination with aTIV produced slightly higher but acceptable local and systemic reactogenicity compared with repeated
TIV vaccination, while the mixed regimens of aTIV-TIV and
TIV-aTIV were similar to the “reference” TIV-TIV regimen in
terms of the pattern and frequency of local and systemic adverse
events. For unsolicited AEs, the pattern and frequency were generally similar between groups. There were no vaccine-related
SAEs. Prior to the study, there were concerns of enhanced AEs
following revaccination one year following the original study, or
when the similar antigenic strains were used in the second round
of vaccinations. However, enhanced reactivity was not observed.
Thus, within the limited experience of this study with small data
sets, the considerably higher antibody titers achieved upon vaccination with aTIV, with a minor increase in reactogenicity, provides a benefit:risk that might be justifiable.[29]

Higher antibody titers are needed in young children to
produce levels of efficacy seen in adults at lower titers of
»40. In the efficacy study prior to this follow-up, we showed
that an HI titer of 110 was correlated with a vaccine efficacy
of 50%, and 330 with a clinical efficacy of 80% against the
circulating H3N2 strain,[12] although this needs to be confirmed in other studies. The demonstration that an HI titer
of 40 correlated with 50% protection in children 6–17 years
of age supports an age threshold within this range when a
majority of children will have been primed – consistent with
recommendations in the US that children under 9 years of
age need 2 doses in their first season of vaccination in order
to prime them.[30] Thus the greater reliance on antibodies for
protection provided by the inactivated vaccine in young children favors the annual use of aTIV starting at 6 months and
through an undefined age, probably in the interval between 6
and 9 years of age.
The impact of influenza vaccination on T-cell immunity in
children, and differences elicited by inactivated vs. live attenuated
vaccine, are currently important topics in the field of influenza
vaccine development. Some investigators have proposed that
TIV vaccination of children may prevent the induction of a
broad cellular immune response, which could place them at
greater risk for pandemic influenza infection, although clinical
evidence for this in the 2009 pandemic was unclear.[31-38]

One limitation of this study was that there was no possibility
to investigate the impact of aTIV on cellular immunity,
although, in other studies, MF59 is known to stimulate T-cell


immunity but not shown to bias the immune response in children toward Th1 or Th2.[39-40]

Altogether, within the limitations of a small study, the
strong immune responses and adequate safety profile of aTIV
support the use of such vaccines for annual vaccination in
young children, beginning at 6 months of age. Ultimately, a
study starting at 6 months of age followed by annual vaccinations using either aTIV or TIV should be designed to prove
this assumption.

### Methods

Study design
This Phase 3b, randomized, observer-blind, pediatric extension study was performed at 15 sites across Finland from September 2010 until January 2011 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT01210898). The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Pirkanmaa Hospital District, and the study was performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki
and Good Clinical Practice. Before enrollment, written informed
consent was obtained from all parents/legal guardians.

Objective
In the previously reported efficacy study (ClinicalTrials.gov:
NCT01015885) greater immunogenicity and efficacy were dem�
onstrated for aTIV over split TIV (Influsplit SSW, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) in children aged 6-<72 months in
2008–2009.[11] The main objective of this extension study was to
evaluate the immunogenicity following vaccination with aTIV or
subunit TIV administered as age-dependent full or half doses in
2010–2011 according to the criteria defined by the European
CHMP and US. CBER.[41,42] All subjects who received either seasonal or monovalent pandemic vaccine in 2009 were excluded
from the analyses. Additional objectives were to assess antibody
persistence at 6 months following vaccination and to evaluate the
reactogenicity and safety profiles for each vaccine. SAEs were collected up to 1 year postvaccination.
Of those subjects receiving pandemic vaccination in 2009
�
(AS03-adjuvanted containing vaccine Pandemrix, GSK), safety
and immunogenicity against A/H1N1 strain were added as supplementary data

Subjects
Eligible study participants were healthy children who had
received 2 doses of at least 1 of the study vaccines in the previous
parent trial and whose parents/legal guardians had given prior
written informed consent. Principal exclusion criteria included
any history or ongoing (chronic) illness likely to interfere with
the results; hypersensitivity to vaccine components; receipt of any
other vaccine <2 weeks (for inactivated vaccines) or 4 weeks (for
live vaccines) prior to enrollment in this study or who were planning to receive any vaccine <4 weeks from the study vaccine;
participation in any clinical trial with another investigational
product 30 days prior to the first study visit or intention to participate in another clinical study at any time during the conduct


-----

of this study; antibiotics <6 days before vaccination; axillary
temperature �37.3[�]C within 3 days prior to the first visit, and
receipt of blood, blood products and/or plasma derivative or any
parenteral immunoglobulin preparation in the previous
12 weeks.

Study procedures
In the original efficacy study, subjects were primed in 2008–
09 with 2 age-appropriate doses of TIV, aTIV or noninfluenza
control vaccine (Control) vaccines (meningococcal C conjugate

[Menjugate[�], Novartis Vaccines] or tickborne encephalitis vaccines [Encepur Children[�], Novartis Vaccines]). In this study,
aTIV- and TIV-primed children were re-randomized to be revaccinated with either aTIV or TIV. Children aged <36 months
were randomized 1:1 to receive half a dose (0.25mL) of TIV or
aTIV; children �36 months of age were randomized 1:1:1 to
receive a full dose (0.5mL) of TIV, or a half or full dose of aTIV.
Influenza vaccine-na€ıve control subjects previously vaccinated
with control noninfluenza received half a dose of aTIV (children
<36 months), or were randomized 1:1 to receive half or full
dose of aTIV (children aged �36 months). Because the numbers
of subjects in these dose subgroups were so small, they were combined within each treatment arm for this paper.
Blood samples (5 mL per sample) were obtained for immunogenicity analyses at baseline (Day 1, prevaccination), 3 weeks
after vaccination (Day 22), and approximately 6 months (Day
181) after immunization.

Vaccines
aTIV and TIV each contained 15 mg of hemagglutinin antigen from each of the 3 World Health Organization recommended influenza strains for the 2010–2011 influenza season in
the northern hemisphere: A/ California/7/2009 (H1N1), A/
Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008(Victoria).
A standard dose of the adjuvant MF59, as used in one 0.5-mL
dose of the commercially available seasonal influenza vaccine
Fluad, contains 9.75 mg squalene, 1.175 mg polysorbate 80,
1.175 mg sorbitan trioleate, 0.66 mg sodium citrate, 0.04 mg
citric acid, and water for injection. Vaccines were supplied in
monodose, prefilled syringes filled with 0.5 mL with a pediatric
mark at 0.25mL for administration in subjects <36 months.
The vaccine formulations were prepared and administered by
unblinded study personnel, who otherwise did not participate in
evaluation of the subjects during the study. The vaccines were
administered intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle preferably of
the non-dominant arm.

Immunogenicity assessment
Blood samples taken for immunologic assays were tested at the
Novartis Vaccines Clinical Serology Laboratory in Marburg,
Germany, for HI antibody responses to strains contained in the
vaccine (vide supra). HI antibody responses on Days 1, 22, and
181 were expressed as GMTs, GMRs of the postvaccination to
prevaccination titer (Day 22/Day 1 titer and Day 181/Day 1
titer); seroprotection rates were defined as the percentage of subjects with HI titers �40, and seroconversion rates were defined as


the percentage of subjects per group achieving at least a 4-fold
increase in HI titer from a seropositive prevaccination titer (�10)
or a rise from <10 to �40 in those who were originally seronegative. Percentages of subjects with HI titers �110 were also calculated, as this cut-off titer was shown in one analysis to predict a
50% clinical protective level in young children, compared with
the conventional HI titer of �1:40 associated with 50% protection of young adults.[12]

Safety assessment
Subjects were monitored for 30 minutes after each vaccination for possible immediate adverse reactions. Parents/legal
guardians were unaware of the study vaccine administered to
their children and were instructed to complete diary cards to
record specified local and systemic reactions for 7 days, starting
on the day of vaccination. Solicited local reactions included
ecchymosis, erythema, induration, swelling and tenderness (children <36 months) or ecchymosis, erythema, induration, swelling and pain at injection site (children �36 months). Solicited
systemic reactions were sleepiness, diarrhea, vomiting, irritability,
change in eating habits, shivering, and unusual crying (children
<36 months of age), or chills, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, headache and fatigue (children �36 months of age). Other indicators
of reactogenicity were fever (axillary temperature � 37.3[�]C) and
use of analgesics/antipyretic medication. Reports of any AEs were
recorded from Day 1 to Day 22, SAEs and AEs leading to study
withdrawal were recorded throughout the study period. The
severity of AEs was categorized as mild, moderate, or severe, if
they resulted in no limitation, some limitation, or inability to
perform normal daily activities, respectively. Assessments of the
causal relationship of unsolicited AEs to the vaccination were
classified by the investigator as not related, possibly related, or
probably related.

Statistical analyses
CHMP has not established influenza vaccine immunogenicity
criteria for children so those used for young adults were referenced: the percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion for HI
antibody should be >40%; the percentage of subjects achieving
HI antibody titer �40% should be >70% and the GMR should
be >2.5.[42] Immunogenicity was also analyzed using CBER criteria: the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI)
for the percent of subjects achieving seroconversion for HI antibody should be �40% (seroconversion criterion); and the lower
bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the percent of subjects achieving an HI antibody titer �40 should be �70% (seroprotection
criterion).[41] Percentages of subjects with HI titers �110 were
also calculated. Log10-transformed antibody titers were modeled
using analysis of variance for each strain, and GMTs, GMRs,
and corresponding 2-sided 95% CI were calculated. Safety data
were evaluated descriptively and expressed as the percentage or
number of subjects with AEs in each group. Immunogenicity
analyses were conducted on the full analyses set (FAS), which
consisted of subjects who received the study vaccine and provided
at least one evaluable serum sample before and after vaccination.

Safety was analyzed for all subjects exposed to study vaccines who
provided at least 1 safety data point.
