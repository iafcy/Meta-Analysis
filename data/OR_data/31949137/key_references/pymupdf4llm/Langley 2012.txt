**Background: During the 2009–2010 influenza pandemic, we evaluated the**
immunogenicity and safety of different H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza
vaccines delivering various viral hemagglutinin (HA) doses with or without
AS03 (a tocopherol oil-in-water emulsion–based adjuvant system) in chil­
dren (NCT00976820).
**Methods: Three hundred twenty-two healthy children 6 months to <9 years**
of age were randomized to receive 2 doses of nonadjuvanted (15 µg or 7.5
µg HA) or adjuvanted vaccine (3.75 µg HA/AS03A or 1.9 µg HA/AS03B),
21 days apart. Blood samples before and after each dose were tested for
immune responses using hemagglutination inhibition and microneutraliza­
tion assays. Safety assessments were done up to day 385.
**Results: The first dose of both AS03-adjuvanted vaccines elicited strong**
immune responses (seroprotection rates: 98.3%/99.0%; seroconversion
rates: 94.9%/97.0%; geometric mean fold rises: 36.2/33.6), which were
higher post-dose 2 (seroprotection rate: 100.0%/100%; seroconversion rate:
100.0%/98.8%; geometric mean fold rise: 157.1/151.6), meeting European

regulatory criteria on days 21 and 42. The nonadjuvanted 15 µg HA vaccine
also met the regulatory criteria after each dose; the 7.5 µg HA vaccine met
them only post-dose 2. Six months post-dose 1, all vaccines except the non­
adjuvanted 7.5 µg HA vaccine met European regulatory criteria. Neutral­
izing antibody response paralleled the hemagglutination inhibition immune
response after each dose. Pain at the injection site, lasting 2–3 days, was
more common following adjuvanted than nonadjuvanted vaccination.
**Conclusions: AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza vaccine**
(3.75 µg or 1.9 µg HA), administered as 2 doses, was highly immunogenic,
induced long-term immune response to 6 months, with a clinically accept­
able safety profile in children aged 6 months to <9 years of age.

oung children have high rates of hospitalization and medical
visits for influenza and have been identified as a priority for

# Y

annual immunization programs.[1] In addition, they serve as a major
source of viral transmission in the community.[2,3] The highest attack
and hospitalization rates for the H1N1 2009 pandemic virus were
reported in children,[4,5] particularly those <12 months of age[6] and
32% of all H1N1 2009 hospitalizations in the United States were in
the pediatric population.[7]

Immunization was seen as the most important factor to mit­
igate the 2009 influenza pandemic.[8] Over 30 pandemic vaccines
were developed worldwide[9] of which about 30% contained oil-inwater adjuvants. Before the implementation of national influenza
vaccine programs, data on the safety and immunogenicity of H1N1
vaccines, unadjuvanted or adjuvanted, were limited. In addition, it
was not known if 1 or 2 doses would be needed. Given the known
immunological naivety/lack of priming of young children, the
number of doses of H1N1 2009 pandemic vaccine that might be
required in this population was particularly relevant.

In Canada, the vaccine used for the universal pandemic influenza
vaccine program in 2009−2010 was an oil-in-water adjuvanted
(AS03A) dose-sparing influenza vaccine. This study in children 6
months to <9 years of age sought to determine whether 1 or 2 doses
of the AS03-adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted vaccines of this pandemic
influenza vaccine [containing 3.75 µg hemagglutinin (HA) or 1.9 µg
HA], administered 21 days apart, could meet the immunogenicity
guidance criteria of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human
Use (CHMP) for the evaluation of pandemic influenza vaccines and
to describe the persistence of this immune response to 6 months. In
addition, the neutralizing antibody response 21 days after each of the 2
vaccine doses in a subset of subjects and the safety and reactogenicity
of the H1N1 2009 vaccines up to 1 year were assessed.

###### MATERIALS AND METHODS

 Study Design and Participants

This was a randomized, controlled multicenter study to
determine the safety and immunogenicity of 1 and 2 doses of adju­
vanted and nonadjuvanted pandemic influenza A H1N1 2009 vac­
cines in children 6 months to <9 years of age. Enrollment was initi­
ated at 12 Canadian centers in October 2009.

Enrollment was conducted in 2 phases. In the first phase,
healthy subjects (target sample size: 240) were randomized using
a blocking scheme of 1:1:1:1 to receive 21 days apart, 2 doses of
either adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted vaccines of H1N1 2009 vaccine
as follows: group 3.75 µg HA/AS03A: 3.75 μg A/California H1N1
influenza antigen plus AS03A (11.86 mg tocopherol); group 1.9 µg
HA/AS03B: 1.9 μg Ag plus AS03B (5.93 mg tocopherol); group
7.5 µg HA: 7.5 μg plain A/California H1N1 influenza antigen;
group 15 µg HA: 15 μg plain A/California H1N1 influenza antigen.
Treatment was allocated by an Internet-based central randomiza­
tion system that used a minimization procedure accounting for
center, age and history of seasonal influenza vaccination. Within
each group, the subjects were to be stratified by age (1:1:2) into 6 to
11 months, 12 to 35 months and 3 to <9 years. This was followed by
safety assessments in the first 120 randomized subjects, within the
7-day postvaccination follow-up period after the first vaccine dose.
The second phase of enrollment occurred after the completion of
the safety review. The target sample size for this phase was 120 sub­
jects, to be enrolled in an open-label manner to receive the AS03Badjuvanted 1.9 µg HA vaccine. The design of the second enrollment
phase was amended to: (1) ensure compliance with the recommen­
dations of Health Canada for the then newly licensed study vaccine
in children,[10] and (2) to adjust for the lower than anticipated number
of volunteers owing to the ongoing mass vaccination programs in
Canada at the time of this study.

The subjects, parents/guardians and study personnel evalu­
ating the safety and immunogenicity endpoints were blinded dur­
ing the first enrollment phase. Study personnel responsible for vac­
cine preparation and administration were unblinded but were not
involved in the evaluation of endpoints.

Exclusion criteria were a history of physician-diagnosed
H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza infection, previous receipt of a
vaccine against this strain, suspected or confirmed immunosup­
pressive condition, receipt of immunoglobulins within 3 months of
study start, a history of allergic reactions to any of the constituents
of influenza vaccines, elevated liver enzymes or an abnormal com­
plete blood count.

Written informed consent was obtained from parents or
guardians of all subjects prior to conducting any study-related pro­
cedures. The study was conducted in accordance with good clini­
cal practice, the Declaration of Helsinki, the US Code of Federal
Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects, the Canadian
Tri-Council Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research
Involving Humans and all relevant local regulations. All studyrelated documents and procedures were approved by the appropri­
ate Ethics Committees. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.
gov; Identifier: NCT 00976820.

###### Study Vaccines

The H1N1 viral seed was prepared from the reassortant
virus NYMC X-179A (New York Medical College, New York) gen­
erated from the A/California/07/2009 strain, based on the recom­
mendations of the World Health Organization and propagated in
embryonated hen’s eggs.

AS03A is an adjuvant system containing α-tocopherol and
squalene in an oil-in-water emulsion [DL-α-tocopherol (11.86 mg),
squalene (10.69 mg) and polysorbate 80 (4.86 mg)]. AS03B is an


adjuvant system containing α-tocopherol and squalene in an oil-inwater emulsion (5.93 mg tocopherol). The antigen suspension and
adjuvant emulsion were made available in separate multidose vials;
the vaccines were reconstituted by mixing the 2 components prior
to administration. The adjuvanted vaccine is marketed by GSK
Biologicals as Arepanrix (GSK Biologicals, Wavre, Belgium). The
vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the deltoid (antero­
lateral thigh for subjects aged <12 months).

The AS03-adjuvanted vaccines were prepared from the 15
µg HA/mL antigen suspension, and the nonadjuvanted vaccines
were prepared from the 30 µg/mL antigen suspension. Each 0.5
mL dose of the H1N1 2009 vaccine contained 5 µg of thimerosal
as preservative.

###### Laboratory Assays

Blood samples for immunogenicity testing were collected
before vaccination (at screening or day 0), 21 days post-dose
1 (day 21), post-dose 2 (day 42) and at month 6. Samples were ana­
lyzed at GSK Biologicals Central laboratory (Dresden, Germany)
using a validated in-house micro-titer hemagglutination inhibition
(HI) assay (cutoff: ≥1:10), using chicken erythrocytes as previously
described by Hehme et al.[11] The A/California/7/2009 strain was
used as the antigen strain.

The viral microneutralization assay was performed at
Viroclinics BioSciences, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, using the
A/Netherland/602/2009 strain as the reference strain, as described
previously[12,13]; the 50% neutralization titer of a serum was cal­
culated by the Reed and Muench method.[14] The assay cutoff was
1:8. The laboratories performing the assays for evaluating immune
responses were blinded to treatment assignment.

###### Immunogenicity Assessments

The primary objective was to assess whether HI response in
subjects 21 days post-dose 1 (day 21) and post-dose 2 (day 42) met
the immunogenicity guidance criteria formulated by the CHMP
for pandemic influenza vaccines [point estimates for HI antibody
seroconversion rate (SCR): >40%, seroprotection rate (SPR):
>70% and geometric mean fold rise (GMFR): >2.5].[15] The SCR
was defined as the proportion of subjects with a prevaccination HI
titer <1:10 and a postvaccination titer ≥1:40, or a prevaccination HI
titer >1:10 and a 4-fold increase in postvaccination titer, the SPR
as the proportion of subjects with postvaccination HI titer ≥1:40,
and the GMFR as the geometric mean of the within-subject differ­
ence of the postvaccination reciprocal HI titer and the prevaccina­
tion reciprocal titer. The secondary immunogenicity assessments
included assessment of neutralizing antibody immune response in
terms of vaccine response rates (VRRs) and geometric mean titers
(GMTs), before vaccination and 21 days after each vaccine dose
and persistence of HI immune response at month 6 for the different
age strata (6 to 11 months, 12 to 35 months and 3 to <9 years). The
impact of previous seasonal influenza vaccination on the immune
response was also assessed.

###### Safety and Reactogenicity Assessments

Subject’s parents used diary cards to record the occurrence
and intensity of solicited local adverse events (AEs) (pain, red­
ness and swelling) and solicited general AEs [subjects 6 months
to <6 years of age: drowsiness, fever, irritability/fussiness and loss
of appetite; subjects ≥6 years to <9 years of age: fatigue, fever,
gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, joint pain, muscle ache,
shivering (chills) and sweating] during each 7-day postvaccination
follow-up period.

Intensity of solicited symptoms was graded on a standard
scale of 0–3 (except fever which was graded on a scale of 0–4),


-----

with grade 3 symptoms being those that prevented normal daily
activities. Grade 3 redness and swelling were defined as those
with a diameter of >100 mm; fever was defined as body
temperatures ≥38.0°C (≥100.4°F); grade 3 fever: body temperatures
≥39.0–40.0°C (≥102.2–104.0°F); grade 4 fever: body temperatures
>40.0°C (>104.0°F). The occurrence of unsolicited AEs was
recorded through the 42-day postvaccination follow-up period up
to day 84, while the occurrence of medically attended unsolicited
AEs, potential immune-mediated diseases (subset of AEs that
include both autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or
neurologic disorders which may or may not have an autoimmune
etiology, a subject of interest for public health authorities) and
serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded during the entire
study period (up to day 385). An assessment of causality was
done by the investigator for all reported AEs except for solicited
local symptoms (which were assumed to be vaccine related).
Clinical laboratory evaluations were performed on subjects before
vaccination and at visits at days 7, 21, 42 and 182.

###### Statistical Analyses

The sample size was calculated taking into consideration the
objective to meet or exceed the CHMP immunogenicity guidance
criteria for HI endpoints following each vaccine dose.[15] Approxi­
mately 360 evaluable subjects (including subjects enrolled during
both enrollment phases) were estimated to give a power of >99.99%,
assuming 90% as reference for SPR and SCR, respectively.

The primary analyses of immunogenicity were performed
on the according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity,
and the analyses of safety were performed on the total vaccinated
cohort (TVC). All immunogenicity and safety parameters were cal­
culated with 95% confidence intervals.

###### RESULTS

 Demographics Characteristics

A total of 375 subjects were enrolled, of which 322 subjects
received at least 1 dose of vaccine and were considered the TVC.
The reasons for elimination of subjects from the ATP cohorts for
immunogenicity assessment at different time points are presented
in Figure 1.

The overall demographic profile of the 4 study groups was
comparable. The mean age of subjects in the TVC before vaccina­
tion was 4.2 years (range: 0.5−9.6 years); 54.0% of the subjects
were male. The study population was predominantly of Caucasian/
European heritage (66.5%).

###### Immune Responses HI Immune Response

The HI antibody responses before vaccination, 21 days after
each of the 2 vaccine doses and at month 6 for the ATP cohorts are
presented in Table 1. The first dose of the 2 AS03-adjuvanted vac­
cines (3.75 µg HA/AS03A and 1.9 µg HA/AS03B) elicited strong
immune responses that met the CHMP immunogenicity guidance
criteria for pandemic influenza vaccines (SPRs: 98.3%/99.0%;
SCRs: 94.9%/97.0%; GMFR: 36.2/33.6, respectively). The first
dose of the nonadjuvanted 15 µg HA met all 3 CHMP criteria,
whereas the 7.5 µg HA vaccine while meeting the CHMP criteria
for SCR and GMFR, failed to meet the CHMP criteria for SPR.
Among the nonadjuvanted vaccines, following 1 vaccination dose,
the 15 µg HA dose was more immunogenic than the 7.5 µg HA
dose (SPRs: 77.8%/64.9%; SCRs: 75.9%/59.6%; GMFR: 13.8/7.6,
respectively).

The first dose of adjuvanted vaccines (both 3.75 µg HA/
AS03A and 1.9 µg HA/AS03B) elicited strong immune responses


in all 3 age strata (Table 2). In contrast, the first dose of nonad­
juvanted 15 µg HA vaccine failed to elicit a sufficiently strong
immune response in the 6–11 months age stratum, whereas the
nonadjuvanted 7.5 µg HA vaccine was insufficiently immunogenic
in the 6–11 months and 12–35 months age strata. This trend toward
reduced responses in younger age cohorts to the first dose of the
nonadjuvanted vaccines was not observed in subjects who received
the adjuvanted vaccines, although it should be noted that there was
a modest number of subjects in the younger age strata.

Following the second dose, both the adjuvanted and non­
adjuvanted vaccines elicited strong immune responses that met
CHMP guidance criteria for pandemic influenza vaccines. The
SPRs following the second dose of the adjuvanted vaccines and
the 15 µg HA nonadjuvanted vaccine were 100% across all age
strata. The groups receiving the AS03-adjuvanted vaccines of the
H1N1 2009 vaccine had higher GMTs and GMFRs than the groups
receiving nonadjuvanted vaccines.

Six months after the first vaccine dose, overall, all vaccines
still met all CHMP criteria (Table 1); however, age-stratified data
showed that the CHMP guidance criteria was not met for all 3
age strata (6 to 11 months, 12 to 35 months and 3 to <9 years)
for subjects who received the nonadjuvanted 7.5 µg HA vaccine
(Table 2).

The CHMP guidance criteria were met at all time points
across all 3 age strata only by the AS03-adjuvanted vaccines
(Table 2).

###### Neutralizing Antibody Response

Neutralizing antibody VRRs were generally higher in sub­
jects who received the 2 AS03-adjuvanted vaccines (post-dose
1: 91.1%/81.4%; post-dose 2: 96.9%/100%, following 3.75 µg
HA/AS03A and 1.9 µg HA/AS03B, respectively) than those who
received the nonadjuvanted vaccines (post-dose 1: 73.0%/55.8%;
post-dose 2: 86.7%/67.6%, following 15 µg HA and 7.5 µg HA
vaccines, respectively). The corresponding neutralizing antibody
GMTs and neutralizing antibody VRRs by age strata are presented
in Table 3.

###### Impact of Previous Seasonal Influenza Vaccination History

A history of previous vaccination with trivalent seasonal
influenza vaccine did not appear to influence the immune response
elicited by the adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted vaccines, as evident
from the similar HI antibody SPR, SCR and GMFR and neutralizing
antibody VRRs and GMTs in subjects who had previously received
any seasonal influenza vaccine compared to those who were
influenza vaccine naive (Table 4).

###### Safety and Reactogenicity

The frequency of reporting for all solicited local and gen­
eral symptoms by age strata are presented in Figures 2 and 3,
respectively. Overall, during the 7-day postvaccination period,
injection site pain was the most frequently recorded solicited
local symptom in all age strata and was reported more frequently
in subjects who received the AS03-adjuvanted vaccines (54.3–
84.6%) compared to those who received the nonadjuvanted vac­
cines (39.1–70.6%). Similarly, grade 3 injection site pain was
more frequently reported among subjects who received the AS03adjuvanted vaccines (5.6−19.2%) compared to those who received
the nonadjuvanted vaccines (4.2−5.9%). The overall incidence of
solicited local AEs appeared to be higher in subjects who received
the AS03-adjuvanted vaccines with a similar incidence for both

3.75 µg HA/AS03A and 1.9 µg HA/AS03B HA-adjuvanted vac­
cines (Fig. 2).

During the 7-day postvaccination period, irritability and
loss of appetite were the most frequently reported solicited gen­
eral AEs in subjects 6 months through 5 years of age who received
the AS03-adjuvanted vaccines (36.0−86.4%; 35.8−68.2%,


respectively) as well as in those who received the nonadjuvanted
vaccine (23.8−58.3%; 9.5−39.1%, respectively). In subjects 6 to
<9 years of age who received the AS03-adjuvanted vaccines, fever
and headache (34.6−50.0%; 46.2−50.0%, respectively) were most
frequently reported, while in subjects who received the nonadju­
vanted vaccines fatigue, headache and gastrointestinal symptoms

(23.5−44.4%; 23.5−27.8%; 17.6−38.9%, respectively) were most
frequently reported. The frequency of grade 3 solicited general
AEs in the respective age strata were comparable in subjects who
received either the AS03-adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted vaccines,
except for grade 3 fever, which was reported only in subjects who
received the AS03-adjuvanted vaccines; the highest incidence of
grade 3 fever was reported in subjects who received the 3.75 µg
HA/AS03A vaccine (6 months to 5 years: 8.0−18.2%; 6 years to <9
years: 11.1%, including 2 subjects with fever >40°C).

No significant difference was observed across study groups
in the percentage of subjects with at least 1 unsolicited AE (46.9–
59.4%), the percentage of subjects with at least 1 unsolicited AE of
grade 3 intensity (1.6−4.7%), the percentage of subjects with unso­
licited AEs that were causally related to vaccination (9.0–15.9%)
during the 84-day postvaccination period. None of the unsolicited


AEs were reported in >14.8% of subjects in each study group. The
most frequently reported unsolicited AEs were cough (4.5−9.5%
of subjects), nasopharyngitis (4.7−9.5% of subjects), pyrexia
(6.0−7.8% of subjects), upper respiratory tract infection (3.2−7.5%
of subjects) and vomiting (3.1−9.5% of subjects), none of which
appeared to have any association with vaccination. Owing to the
modest number of subjects in each treatment group, the data on
unsolicited AEs should be interpreted with caution. The percent­
age of subjects with unsolicited AEs occurring up to day 385 that
required medical attention ranged between 54.0% and 68.0%
across the 4 study groups.

A total of 5 SAEs were reported in 4 subjects during the
entire study period; all 4 subjects received AS03-adjuvanted
vaccines. The SAEs included convulsions (2 events in 2 subjects,
occurring 266 days and 105 days, respectively, following the second

subject). All SAEs resolved by the end of the study period. The
investigators assessed all SAEs to be unrelated to vaccination. No
potential immune-mediated diseases were reported. No laboratory
findings were judged to be clinically significant by investigators.

###### DISCUSSION
In this comparison of the immunogenicity and safety of
adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted vaccines of H1N1 2009 pandemic
influenza vaccines in children, the AS03-adjuvanted dose-sparing
vaccines produced strong immune responses after the first dose
across all age strata which met CHMP regulatory criteria for immu­
nogenicity. Immune responses for the nonadjuvanted 15 µg vaccine
also met the European regulatory criteria for the entire pediatric
age group after 1 dose, but not for infants 6−11 months of age. This
youngest age group, and 12−35 month olds, had inferior responses
to the first 7.5 µg unadjuvanted dose. However, it should be noted
that there were very few subjects in the younger age strata. A 2-dose
schedule of all vaccines met the European regulatory criteria. In
addition, the immune responses following vaccination persisted to
6 months after the first vaccine dose, although the CHMP guid­
ance criteria were met across all 3 age strata only in subjects who
received the AS03-adjuvanted vaccines and the nonadjuvanted 15 µg


HA vaccine. Overall, only the AS03-adjuvanted vaccines met
CHMP guidance criteria at all time points in subjects from all age
strata. The neutralizing antibody immune response paralleled the
HI antibody immune response across the study groups. All vaccines
were well tolerated, but injection site pain and systemic responses
were more common after adjuvanted vaccines.

This trial took place in a unique context. The aim was to pro­
vide decisive data to the public health authorities in Canada (Health
Canada), who were beginning the rollout of a universal pandemic
influenza vaccine program. The trial safety summaries based on
uncleaned data at day 7 and immunogenicity and safety summary
reports at day 21 were provided promptly to decision makers. This
information was used to inform policy including dosage recom­
mendations and public messages and was publicly disseminated
through the Public Health Agency of Canada Web site. Based on
the evolving epidemiology of disease in late 2009 and trial results
showing strong immunogenicity data, Canadian public health
authorities recommended 1 dose (3.75 µg HA) of adjuvanted vac­
cine for children over 10 years of age, and 1 or 2 doses (1.9 µg HA),
21 days apart for younger children or those with certain chronic
health conditions.[16]

Unadjuvanted seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vac­
cines have lower efficacy in younger children, who may have no
prior priming experience with infection or vaccine.[17] While studies

with nonadjuvanted H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza vaccines in
the pediatric population have shown that 1 dose may not elicit a
satisfactory immune response in children, an observation that is
already established for seasonal influenza vaccines,[18−21] there are
limited data on the immunogenicity and safety of adjuvanted H1N1
2009 pandemic influenza vaccines in the pediatric population.
A previous study with similar adjuvanted H1N1 2009 vaccines, as
used in the present study conducted in children aged 6−35 months
(3.75 µg and 1.9 µg HA), reported 100% SPR following the first
dose.[22] However, these studies did not have a comparator treatment
arm with a nonadjuvanted vaccine. Another study in children aged


6 months to <13 years that compared a similar 1.9 µg HA/AS03B
vaccine and a nonadjuvanted 7.5 µg HA vaccine from another
manufacturer reported a higher SCR in subjects who received the
adjuvanted vaccine following 2 doses (99.3% versus 78.2% for the
nonadjuvanted vaccine).[23] A study using a different oil-in-water
(MF59) adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine in unprimed chil­
dren 6−35 months of age also showed that the adjuvanted vaccine
was more immunogenic than the unadjuvanted vaccine.[24]

In the present study, the 2 AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 2009
pandemic influenza vaccines elicited strong immune responses
in the pediatric population following a single dose that exceeded

the CHMP criteria for pandemic influenza vaccines (SPRs:
98.3%/99.0%; SCRs: 94.9%/97.0%; GMFR: 36.2/33.6, respec­
tively). Following the second dose of both AS03-adjuvanted vac­
cines, SPRs increased to 100% and SCRs were 100% and 98.8%,
respectively. As observed in previous studies,[22] the 3.75 µg HA/
AS03A vaccine did not appear to further optimize the immune
responses when compared with the 1.9 µg HA/AS03B vaccine.
Of the 2 nonadjuvanted vaccines, the 15 µg HA vaccine elicited a
stronger immune response, with SPRs and SCRs reaching 100%,
following the second dose.

The safety profile of the 4 influenza vaccines, adjuvanted
and unadjuvanted, was similar to that of seasonal trivalent inacti­
vated influenza vaccines in children.[25,26] Injection site tenderness
is usually the most common symptom, beginning 6–12 hours after
vaccination and lasting for 1–2 days. Fever can occur in up to 5% of
children receiving trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines and can
be more frequent in children exposed for the first time to influenza
antigens. Although a comparable incidence of all general solicited
AEs was seen across all study groups receiving these monovalent


pandemic vaccines, it was noted that children receiving the higher
dose adjuvanted vaccine (3.75 µg HA/AS03A vaccine) appeared
to have an increased incidence of fever following the second dose
and fever ≥39°C was reported in 2 subjects. This difference in the
reporting of solicited general symptoms has also been observed in
a previous pediatric study with a similar vaccine.[22]

Superior immune responses were elicited by the AS03adjuvanted vaccines when compared with the nonadjuvanted vac­
cines, using substantially low antigen content. This is especially
important at the time of a pandemic when a sufficient number of
doses of pandemic influenza vaccine must be made available. The
assessment of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
licensure criteria for pandemic influenza vaccines was not a sec­
ondary endpoint[27]; however, the lower bounds of the immunogenic­
ity parameters indicated that the adjuvanted vaccines induced HI
immune responses that met them after the first and second doses
and at month 6, although for the nonadjuvanted vaccines the Center
for Biologics Evaluation and Research criteria were met only fol­
lowing the second dose.

Although the immunogenicity data obtained for the
adjuvanted study vaccine are encouraging, further assess­
ment of the duration of immunity following 1 or 2 doses is
necessary. In this study, it was observed that the immune
responses persisted up to 6 months after the first vaccine dose;
2 doses of all vaccines except the nonadjuvanted 7.5 µg HA
induced immune responses in subjects across all 3 age strata
(6 to 11 months, 12 to 35 months and 3 to <9 years) that met
CHMP guidance criteria for pandemic vaccines at month 6.
A case-control study done in one Canadian province using the
same adjuvanted vaccine (1.9 µg HA) estimated the vaccine
efficacy at 96% after 1 dose in children <10 years of age.[28] The
role of 1 or 2 doses in priming with subsequent annual booster
vaccination is also not yet known, although the 6-fold increase
induced by the second vaccination does suggest priming after 1
dose. Of note, booster vaccination with AS03-adjuvanted H5N1
vaccine at 6 or 12 months from primary vaccination has been


shown to be effective in adults irrespective of whether 1 or 2
primary doses were given.[29]
