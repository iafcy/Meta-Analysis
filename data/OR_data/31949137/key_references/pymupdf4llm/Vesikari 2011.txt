**Background**
The efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines is known to be poor in infants and
young children.

**Methods**
We studied the effect of the adjuvant MF59, an oil-in-water emulsion, on the efficacy
of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in 4707 healthy children 6 to less than
72 months of age who had not previously been vaccinated against influenza. The
children were randomly assigned to three study groups, each of which received the
assigned vaccines in two doses, 28 days apart, during two consecutive influenza
seasons. Two of the groups were given age-appropriate doses of TIV either with or
without the MF59 adjuvant, and the third group was given control (noninfluenza)
vaccines to assess their absolute and relative efficacy against influenza-like illness,
as confirmed by means of polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay.

**Results**
Attack rates of influenza-like illness across both influenza seasons were 0.7%, 2.8%,
and 4.7% in the adjuvant, nonadjuvant, and control vaccine groups, respectively. The
absolute vaccine efficacy rates against all influenza strains (94 of 110 cases were
due to vaccine-matched H3N2 viruses) were 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74 to
93) for the MF59-adjuvant vaccine (ATIV) and 43% (95% CI, 15 to 61) for the vaccine
without the adjuvant (TIV); the relative vaccine efficacy rate for ATIV versus TIV was
75% (95% CI, 55 to 87). The efficacy rates for ATIV were 79% (95% CI, 55 to 90) in
children 6 to less than 36 months of age and 92% (95% CI, 77 to 97) in those 36 to
less than 72 months of age, as compared with 40% (95% CI, −6 to 66) and 45%
(95% CI, 6 to 68), respectively, for TIV. Antibody responses were higher with ATIV
and remained so through day 181. The rates of systemic and local reactions to the
influenza vaccines with and without the adjuvant were similar in the younger age
group (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.09), but systemic events in the older age
group were more frequent after administration of ATIV (63%) than after administration of TIV (44%) or the control vaccine (50%). Serious adverse events were distributed evenly across the three vaccine groups.

**Conclusions**
Influenza vaccine with the MF59 adjuvant is efficacious against PCR-confirmed
influenza in infants and young children. (Funded by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00644059.)

hildren have the highest rates of
seasonal influenza infection and illness,
with amplification of community viral

# Ctransmission. Thus, numerous countries recom
mend routine seasonal vaccination to protect children directly and the entire population indirectly.[1-9]
Parenteral trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
(TIV) is poorly immunogenic in young children,
with an efficacy of only 59.0% in children older
than 2 years of age.[10-12] Although intranasal live
attenuated influenza vaccine has an efficacy of
69.2 to 95.6% in children 2 to 7 years of age, it
cannot be used in children under 2 years of age
because of the increased risk of hospitalization
or in children under 5 years of age who have a
history of wheezing, because of the increased risk
of wheezing.[13,14]

MF59 is an oil-in-water emulsion that augments
the immune response when combined with vaccine antigens. It has been used since 1997 as a
TIV adjuvant (ATIV) for seasonal vaccination in
older adults and is licensed for such use in 27
countries.[15-17] We previously found that ATIV induced greater immune responses than did TIV in
children 6 to 36 months of age,[18,19] and we report here the efficacy of these two types of vaccines in a field trial in children 6 to less than 72
months of age who had not previously received
influenza vaccine.


Methods


**Study Design and Objectives**
We conducted this phase 3 study during two influenza seasons: 2007–2008 in Germany (654 children) and 2008–2009 in Germany (2104 children)
and Finland (1949 children). Participants were
stratified according to age (6 to <36 months and
36 to <72 months) and were randomly assigned
to one of three study groups. In year 1, they were
assigned to ATIV, subunit TIV, or control (non­
influenza) vaccine in a ratio of 2:1:1; in study year 2,
they were assigned to ATIV, split TIV, or control vaccine in a ratio of 2:2:1. The subunit influenza vaccine consisted of purified hemagglutinin and neuraminidase viral-surface proteins; the split vaccine
consisted of purified disrupted virions. Vaccines
were administered in two doses, 28 days apart, with
or without concomitant routine vaccines.
The study was approved by the ethics committee at each participating study center and
was conducted according to the International
Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical


Practice guidelines. Although planned to last
3 years, the study was terminated in 2009 after
requests by the ethics committees to substitute
seasonal vaccine with monovalent influenza A
(H1N1) vaccine; any children who were recruited
and vaccinated with pandemic (A/H1N1) or nonpandemic vaccines in year 3 were not included in
this analysis.
The principal study objectives were to show
that in children 6 to less than 36 months of age,
ATIV has an acceptable level of combined local
and systemic reactogenicity, as compared with TIV,
and superior protective efficacy, as compared with
control vaccine, against vaccine-matched influenza
illness confirmed by means of real-time polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. The study participants were healthy children who had not previously received influenza vaccine, who had no
contraindications to vaccination, and whose parents gave written informed consent. Solicited reactions were recorded on diary cards for 7 days,
with active follow-up for 28 days after each vaccination for unsolicited adverse events and for
6 months in study year 1 and for 12 months in
study year 2 to collect data on adverse events that
were serious or led to withdrawal from the study.
During the two consecutive influenza seasons,
beginning 3 weeks after administration of the
second vaccine dose, if a child became ill, the parents were asked to bring the child to the clinic for
examination within 7 days after the onset of the
illness, at which time nasopharyngeal aspirates
or swabs were obtained for confirmation of the
influenza diagnosis and for strain identification
by means of real-time PCR and gene-sequencing
techniques developed and conducted at the Universitätsklinikum Jena.[1,20] Events occurring within the preceding 7 days were recorded as unsolicited adverse events.
In study year 2, in a convenience sample of 793
children who were recruited at 14 sites in Finland,
we obtained at least one prevaccination blood
sample (on day 1) and three postvaccination samples (on days 29, 51, and 181). Hemagglutinationinhibition antibody titers were measured against
three homologous 2008–2009 vaccine strains and
against three heterologous vaccine strains —
A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/
15/2009 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 — from
influenza seasons 2007–2008, 2010–2011, and
2009–2010, respectively (see the Methods section
in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the
full text of this article at NEJM.org).[21] Seropro

**Active Vaccines and Control Vaccines**
In the 2007–2008 season, ATIV (Fluad, Novartis
Vaccines), which included MF59 emulsion adjuvant, and subunit TIV (Agrippal S1, Novartis Vaccines) contained World Health Organization reference strains A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1),
A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/
2506/2004). In the 2008–2009 season, ATIV and
split TIV (Influsplit SSW, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) contained A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1),
A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2), and B/Florida/4/2006
strains. Vaccines contained 15 μg of hemagglutinin from each of three viral subtypes in each
0.5-ml dose. Children 6 to less than 36 months
of age received 0.25-ml doses, and children 36 to
less than 72 months of age received 0.5-ml doses.
Control vaccines were meningococcal C conjugate vaccine (Menjugate, Novartis Vaccines), given in 0.25-ml doses in children 6 to less than 12
months of age, and tickborne encephalitis vaccine (Encepur Children, Novartis Vaccines), given
in 0.5-ml doses in children 12 to less than 72
months of age.

**Statistical Analysis**
We planned to enroll approximately 8000 children
over three seasons in order to have 90% power for
the safety objective and up to 80% power for the
efficacy objective. Demographic characteristics
were tabulated with the use of descriptive statistics. The relative risk of real-time PCR–confirmed
influenza-like illness was estimated with the use
of a Poisson regression model that included season, region, and age cohort (when applicable) as
independent variables, with log10-transformed values for time at risk as an offset variable (ignoring
family and household relationships of the study


participants). The ratio of likelihood-based estimates and two-sided 97.7% confidence intervals
were adjusted for the primary efficacy and safety
analyses and one interim analysis; for other analy­
ses, 95% confidence intervals were calculated. The
Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel approach was used for
the safety analysis and selected vaccine efficacy results, for robustness. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as (1 – the relative risk) × 100%. The two primary analyses were adjusted for multiplicity, so
that in 240 comparative analyses (e.g., of vaccine
efficacy in four age cohorts, as well as solid-phase
and geometric mean titers in two age cohorts
each), 12 significant findings could be expected
by chance. To evaluate immunogenicity end points,
least-squares geometric mean titers and ratios and
associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals
were determined by means of analysis of variance
(with log10 transformation).


**Study Population and Follow-up**
Baseline characteristics of the 4707 enrolled children were similar among the three vaccine groups
(Fig. 1). Safety data were available for 4692 children, 4513 of whom completed the study; 13 children withdrew because of adverse events.

**Assessments of Efficacy**
Of 47 cases of influenza-like illness in the control group (Table 1), 4 occurred among 164 children in study year 1 (attack rate, 2.4%) and 43
among 829 children in study year 2 (attack rate,
5.2%). Vaccine efficacy was not calculated for
year 1, since there were only 5 cases, 3 of which
were due to B/Florida/4/2006–like viruses (Yama­
gata lineage, lineage-mismatched to the vaccine
strain) and 2 of which were due to viruses with
unknown B lineage.
In study year 2, a total of 94 of the 105 isolates
from children with influenza-like illness were A/
Brisbane/10/2007(H3N2)–like viruses (matched to
the vaccine strain), 4 were A-type viruses (subtype
unknown), 5 were B/Brisbane/60/2008–like viruses
(Victoria lineage, lineage mismatched to the vaccine strain), and 2 were B-type viruses (lineage
unknown). No H1N1 viruses were detected. In
study year 2, the vaccine efficacy was 86% (95%
confidence interval [CI], 73 to 92) for ATIV, as
compared with 40% (95% CI, 11 to 60) for split
TIV, for a relative vaccine efficacy of 76% (95% CI,
55 to 87).

The absolute efficacy of ATIV across both influenza seasons was 86% (95% CI, 74 to 93) against
all strains, 89% (95% CI, 78 to 95) against vaccine-matched strains and H3N2 virus, and 79%
(95% CI, −5 to 96) against B strains (Table 1). In
the subanalysis, ATIV was efficacious in both age
groups. In children who were 6 to less than 36
months of age, vaccine efficacy was 79% against
all strains and 81% against vaccine-matched strains
(with lower 95% CI limits of 55% and 49%, respectively), and in children 36 to less than 72 months
of age, vaccine efficacy was 92% against all strains
and 96% against vaccine-matched strains (with
lower 95% CI limits of 77% and 81%, respectively),
fulfilling the primary study objective.
In contrast, TIV had an efficacy of 43% (95%
CI, 15 to 61) against all strains, 45% (95% CI, 16
to 64) against vaccine-matched strains and the


H3N2 virus, and 36% (95% CI, −162 to 84) against
B strains, with similar point estimates in the age
subgroups but with the 95% CI overlapping zero
for children who were 6 to less than 36 months of
age. On the basis of these results, ATIV had higher relative efficacy than TIV, with relative efficacy
rates of 75% (95% CI, 55 to 87) against all strains,
80% (95% CI, 59 to 90) against vaccine-matched
strains and the H3N2 virus, and 66% (95% CI,
−103 to 94) against B strains, in the entire cohort.
The relative efficacy rates for ATIV according to

strains was 75% (95% CI, 20 to 92), whereas TIV
had almost no efficacy (2%) (95% CI, −129 to 58).
The time–cumulative efficacy calculations showed
that the estimates of vaccine efficacy for ATIV and
TIV were robust throughout the 5-month surveillance period (Fig. 2).

**Immunogenicity**
After one dose of vaccine, the proportions of children 6 to less than 36 months of age who had seroprotective hemagglutination-inhibition antibody
titers (≥40) against the homologous influenza A
H1N1 and H3N2 strains were 92% and 95%, respectively, among the ATIV recipients and 20%
and 12%, respectively, among the TIV recipients.
Among children who were 36 to less than 72
months of age, the respective proportions were
100% and 97% for ATIV and 63% and 60% for
TIV (Fig. 3). Moreover, 98 to 100% of all ATIV recipients still had seroprotective titers against these
strains at day 181, whereas the respective proportions for TIV recipients were 49% and 65%.
Two doses of ATIV (day 50) elicited seroprotective antibody titers (≥40) against the homologous
influenza B strain in 88% of the younger children
and in 99% of the older children, with the proportions declining to 40% and 64%, respectively,
by day 181. The proportions of TIV recipients who
had robust hemagglutination-inhibition antibody
titers against the B strain were lower even after
two doses; only 19% of the younger children and
60% of the older children had seroprotective responses, and the proportions were only 13% and
33%, respectively, at day 181. The median interval
between doses for the three vaccine groups was
30 days (standard deviation, 6.1 to 6.9).
Two doses of ATIV produced seroprotective titers (≥40) against heterologous H1N1 and H3N2
antigens in 95 to 100% of recipients in the two age
groups, and these levels were maintained at day
181 in 61% or more of the younger children and in
85% or more of the older children. The B-lineage
mismatch was not effectively overcome by ATIV;
only 5 to 15% of recipients had a seroprotective
titer against the Victoria lineage strain. In those
given TIV, the responses to heterologous strains
were low, with the exception of the heterovariant
H3N2 virus. The geometric mean titers against
A subtype strains in response to heterologous
antigens with ATIV exceeded those in response
to homologous antigens with TIV; in both age
groups, these titers in response to all homolo

gous and heterologous antigens after two doses
of TIV were exceeded or matched after one dose
of ATIV (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix).

**Safety and Reactogenicity**
Among the children who were 6 to less than 36
months of age, the relative risk of solicited adverse
events after one or two doses of ATIV, as compared with TIV, was 1.04 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.09),
fulfilling the primary safety objective. Local adverse events were reported more frequently among
ATIV recipients (54%) and recipients of control vaccine (52%) than among TIV recipients (46%), but
rates of systemic adverse events were similar (68%,
61%, and 66%, respectively). Among the children
who were 36 to less than 72 months of age, local
adverse events were reported in 68%, 60%, and
55% of recipients of ATIV, TIV, and control vaccine, respectively, whereas systemic adverse events
were more frequent among ATIV recipients (63%)
and control-vaccine recipients (50%) than among
TIV recipients (44%). The majority of local and
systemic solicited events, including fever, were mild
or moderate and were transient (Tables 1 and 2
in the Supplementary Appendix). Febrile convulsions were reported in five ATIV recipients, five TIV
recipients, and four recipients of control vaccine.

Discussion


ATIV was efficacious against laboratory-confirmed
influenza caused by all circulating influenza viral
strains during the two study years (86% efficacy
rate), with higher efficacy against vaccine-matched
strains (89%). In contrast, the respective efficacy
rates for TIV were 43% and 45%, resulting in rela

tive efficacy rates of 75% and 80% for ATIV as
compared with TIV. The higher efficacy rates were
significant in the predefined age cohorts (i.e., 6 to
less than 36 months and 36 to less than 72 months)
and also in a post hoc analysis of children who
were 6 to less than 24 months of age. The latter
finding is noteworthy because evidence of the efficacy of TIV in children younger than 24 months
of age is limited.[10,11,22]

Since the results of this study were principally
from year 2, when vaccine-like H3N2 viruses predominated (in 94 of 110 culture-confirmed cases),


n engl j med 365;15 nejm org october 13 2011 1413

the reported overall vaccine efficacy is, in effect,
an H3N2-specific observation.[23] Only 12 infections
with influenza B virus occurred, all involving
strains that were not characterized for vaccine
matching or that were lineage-mismatched to the
vaccine strains, so the B virus–specific efficacy of
ATIV and TIV could not be meaningfully assessed
(observed efficacy, 79% [95% CI, −5 to 96] and
36% [95% CI, −162 to 84], respectively). B-lineage
mismatches present a greater obstacle to vaccine
efficacy than do mismatches due to antigenic drift
because cross-lineage hemagglutination-inhibition
antibodies are not effectively induced by vaccination, especially in children in whom priming has
not been carried out.[1,24-26]

Immune responses to ATIV were significantly
greater than immune responses to TIV and were
maintained for up to 181 days, both against homologous (vaccine) and heterologous strains. Because children under 9 years of age need to receive
two priming doses of TIV, it was notable that
responses to a single ATIV dose met the conventional seroprotection threshold (hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer ≥40) for both A-subtype viruses, a finding that is consistent with
previous observations of seasonal and pandemic
influenza vaccines with the MF59 adjuvant.[1,18,27-31]
Although responses to B strains were lower, 88 to
99% of all children had titers of 40 or higher after
two doses of ATIV, as compared with 19 to 60%
of TIV recipients. Low responses to the B strain
in children are of particular concern, since this
age group has a disproportionate share of influenza B virus infections.[1,32] Moreover, B strains are
frequently responsible for late-season (spring) influenza outbreaks, so the high proportion of children with seroprotective hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers at day 181 (64%) and the
maintenance of vaccine efficacy through the end
of the influenza season are potential advantages
of ATIV over TIV, particularly with the start of vaccine deliveries and immunizations in August.[24,30,33]

In previous studies of seasonal and H5N1 vaccines, formulations that included the MF59 adjuvant elicited higher levels of cross-reactive antibodies to antigenically related viruses than did
their counterparts without the adjuvant.[18,19,34,35]
We confirmed this observation in the current
study for heterovariant A-subtype strains, including an H3N2 strain that did not circulate extensively in the Northern Hemisphere until after the
study’s completion — a prospective benefit when


vaccine and circulating viruses are mismatched.
Since the H3N2 viruses circulating in the second
study year were vaccinelike, there was no opportunity to show clinical efficacy against a drift
variant.
Vaccine-related adverse events were generally
mild to moderate in both age cohorts, with no
important differences in solicited reactogenic
events among the three vaccine groups after either dose in the younger cohort. In older children,
systemic reactions, including mild fever, were
slightly more frequent after receipt of ATIV, as
compared with the other vaccines, but these reactions were mostly mild and of short duration.
Similarly, rates of unsolicited adverse events and
serious adverse events were not disproportionate
in the ATIV group, confirming previous experience with various vaccines having the MF59 adjuvant in trials involving approximately 33,000
children ranging in age from neonates to teenagers under 17 years of age.[18,19,36,37] Although
clinically controlled experience with MF59 in children is limited, information from the commercial distribution of more than 50 million Fluad
doses since 1997 for administration in elderly persons, as well as interim observations from approximately 100 million doses of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccines with the MF59 adjuvant
that were distributed in 2009–2010 in all age
groups (and also in pregnant women), has not revealed any safety concerns.[38-40]

In this controlled trial, the efficacy of an inactivated influenza vaccine in children 6 to less
than 72 months of age was relatively high. Since
protection was principally against the subtype
H3N2 virus, no conclusions could be reached with
regard to the efficacy of ATIV or TIV against H1N1
and B viruses. The immunogenicity analysis indicated that ATIV elicits higher, more persistent,
and more cross-reactive antibody responses than
TIV. There was no opportunity to confirm the
clinical effect of the heterovariant antibodies.
The modest efficacy of TIV against matched
strains (45%) in our study is consistent with the
results of previous studies in children 1 to 5 years
of age (44 to 49%) and in children 6 to 24 months
of age (66% [95% CI, 34 to 82] in the first year
and −7% [95% CI, −247 to 67] in the second year),
as well as with the results of most effectiveness
studies.[10-12,22,25,27,28,41] In infants 6 to 59 months
of age, administration of a live attenuated influenza vaccine led to 54.9% fewer cases of culture

confirmed influenza, as compared with TIV;
however, live attenuated influenza vaccine is not
indicated for children under 24 months of age or
for older children with a history of wheezing.[13,14]
The use of TIV with the MF59 adjuvant, which we
studied, is a potentially effective option for children 6 to less than 72 months of age, with the
additional potential advantages of increased heterovariant coverage, a longer duration of protec
