**Key words: influenza, vaccine, pandemic, H1N1**

Background: The recent global A/H1N1v pandemic led to major efforts to develop effective vaccines against the novel
virus, while global demand and limited production capacity focused attention on dose sparing and schedules.
Results: All three vaccines elicited immune responses in 9–17-year-olds meeting CBER criteria three weeks after one
dose; responses were not enhanced by second dose. In 3–8-year-olds only the adjuvanted vaccine met the CBER crite-
ria after one dose, but all three vaccines met the criteria criteria after second dose. All vaccines were well tolerated; no
related Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and few severe solicited reactions were reported. MF59-adjuvanted vaccine was

in older subjects, all of which decreased after the second dose.
Methods: An open-label phase III study of immunogenicity and safety of novel A/H1N1v vaccines included 392 Costa
Rican children in two pediatric cohorts (3–8 and 9–17 years). They received two doses, of either an MF59®-adjuvanted for-
mulation containing 7.5 μg antigen or non-adjuvanted formulations containing 15 or 30 μg antigen, three weeks apart.
Immunogenicity was assessed as hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers using the CBER licensure criteria.Do not distribute.

Conclusion: One dose of non-adjuvanted A/H1N1v vaccine is adequate in 9–17-year-olds, but younger children require
either one dose of MF59-adjuvanted vaccine or two doses of non-adjuvanted vaccine to achieve protective titers. En-
hanced immunogenicity with MF59 is associated with a small increase in reactogenicity, but no safety issues.

When measured seven days after the second vaccination, two-
to six-fold increases were observed in all groups as compared with
3 weeks after first vaccination. GMTs increased to 2,105, 353 and

later, at six weeks, but the marked elevation of titer observed with
the adjuvanted vaccine persisted, with GMTs of 1,488, 227 and

At all three time-points after first (i.e., Day 22) and after
second (i.e., Day 29 and Day 43) study vaccinations, HI titer

age cohort but the lower limit of the 95% confidence inter-
val extended below this margin in the non-adjuvanted vaccine
groups at Day 22 (Fig. 2). At all three time-points, seroconver-
sion was demonstrated in >40% of subjects in this age cohort and
the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval also exceeded this
threshold (Table 3).
At Day 22 (3 weeks after a single study vaccination) the
7.5 μg-adjuvanted group met all CBER and CHMP criteria.
