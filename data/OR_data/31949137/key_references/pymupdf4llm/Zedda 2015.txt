**Introduction: Annual seasonal influenza epidemics are particularly danger-**
ous for the very young, the elderly and chronically ill individuals, in whom
infection can cause severe morbidity, hospitalization and death. Existing,
nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines exhibit a suboptimal immunogenicity and
efficacy in immunologically naive subjects such as young children.
**Methods: This phase II, randomized clinical trial was conducted to evaluate**
the antibody and cell-mediated responses to a trivalent influenza vaccine
administered without adjuvant (TIV) or adjuvanted with MF59 (ATIV) in
previously nonvaccinated children less than 3 years of age.
**Results: The MF59-adjuvanted vaccine was well tolerated, and induced**
higher titers of hemagglutination inhibition antibodies able to recognize
strains different from the one used in the vaccine (heterovariant) than TIV.
The presence of the adjuvant MF59 induced a larger expansion of vaccinespecific CD4[+] T cells. Interestingly, the adjuvant MF59 did not modify the
cytokine profile of the elicited T cells, characterized by the production of
IL-2 and TNF-α, and did not bias the response toward either Th1 or Th2.
The advantage of ATIV over TIV was more pronounced for the virus strains
that had not circulated in the years that preceded this study and for the
heterovariant strains.
**Conclusion: These data highlight the relevant role played by the oil-in-**
water adjuvant MF59 in enhancing the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza vaccines in immunologically naive individuals.

nfluenza A and B viruses cause epidemic disease in humans and,
in an average year, 20% of children are infected with influenza

viruses. This attack rate is substantially higher during epidemic
years and among restricted populations, such as children in day
care. Furthermore, children shed large quantities of virus for
longer periods of time, thus contributing to the spread of influenza
within the community and household.[1] Some countries (including
the United States) and the World Health Organization recommend
vaccination of children;[2] however, inactivated influenza vaccines,

administered without adjuvant, are less immunogenic in unprimed
individuals, especially those who are of very young age,[3] and this
inadequate immunogenicity translates into a suboptimal efficacy.[4]
The limited efficacy of trivalent inactivated vaccines (TIV)
can potentially be overcome by vaccines formulated with an adjuvant (ATIV). Potent adjuvants for influenza are the oil-in-water
emulsions like MF59.[5] MF59-adjuvanted influenza seasonal vaccines have been licensed in various countries since 1997 for immunization of elderly subjects (65 years and older) and have shown an
optimal safety profile in different age groups[5–7] and a higher effectiveness against influenza hospitalization as compared with nonadjuvanted TIV.[8,9] The higher immunogenicity of MF59-adjuvanted
vaccines is particularly evident in naive individuals. Vaccination of
children with ATIV induces higher and more sustained antibody
responses, as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and by
microneutralization,[4,10] and reduces the attack rates of polymerase
chain reaction-confirmed influenza-like illness.[4] We have previously shown that in naive adults the early expansion of vaccine-specific CD4[+] T lymphocytes associates in a predictive manner with
the induction of high and sustained neutralizing antibody titers to
avian and seasonal influenza viruses.[11,12] A question not addressed
yet is how the addition of MF59 to TIV influences either the magnitude or the cytokine profile of the elicited CD4[+] T-cell response
in children. The present phase II study was conducted to address
this question and to compare the magnitude as well as the cytokine
profile of vaccine-specific CD4[+] T lymphocytes in children, who
were administered the nonadjuvanted (TIV) versus the MF59-adjuvanted subunit trivalent influenza vaccine (ATIV).

###### MATERIALS AND METHODS

 Study Design
This study was a phase II, randomized, multicenter clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01342796) designed to evaluate
both the antibody and the cell-mediated responses elicited by adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines in children.
The protocol and the informed consent form were reviewed and
approved by Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee/Research Ethics Boards before study start. The study was
conducted at 2 centers in Belgium: Sint Vincentius Ziekenhuis,
Antwerp and Kinderartsenassociatie, Hasselt. Recruitment began
in May and July 2011 and was reinitiated between October and
December 2011 to achieve the target sample size.

###### Study Population and Procedures
Eligible participants were previously nonvaccinated healthy
children aged 6 to <36 months of either gender whose parent(s) or
legal guardian(s) had given written informed consent.
Exclusion criteria included any known or suspected impairment of the immune system, any serious medical condition or recent
infectious disease, immunization with licensed vaccines within 2
weeks (for inactivated vaccines) or 4 weeks (for live vaccines) or


-----

any other investigational agent within 30 days prior to enrollment,
or any history of hypersensitivity to any component of the study
vaccine.
Demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects during
the 2 phases of enrollment were similar across treatment groups:
the mean age (21.4 months in the TIV group and 20.2 months in
the ATIV group) and the distribution of subjects below or above
24 months of age were comparable, most of them were Caucasian
(TIV 76% vs. ATIV 79%), and the mean weight, height and body
mass index were similar. There were, however, 66% males enrolled
in the TIV group and 53% in the ATIV group.
A total of 84 children (6 to <36 months of age) were enrolled.
Each participant was randomized to receive 2 intramuscular doses
(0.25 mL each) spaced 4 weeks apart (days 1 and 29) of a trivalent
seasonal influenza vaccine either nonadjuvanted (TIV; n = 41) or
adjuvanted (oil-in-water MF59 emulsion, ATIV; n = 43).
Overall, there were 11 subjects (27%) vaccinated with TIV
and 18 subjects (42%) vaccinated with ATIV for which a major
protocol deviation was reported; these were excluded from the
immunogenicity analysis in a Per Protocol Set (PPS) (TIV; n = 30
for serology, 31 for cell mediated immunity and ATIV; n = 25) but
retained in the Safety Set for as long as they participated in the
study.
The antigen content of TIV and ATIV (both produced at
Novartis Vaccines, Siena, Italy) was identical, each vaccine dose
containing ~7.5 μg of hemagglutinin surface antigen from each
of the 3 strains, A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), A/Perth/16/2009
(H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008. Five milliliters of blood were
taken before vaccination (day 1) and 3 weeks after administration
of the second dose (day 50) for immunogenicity analysis.

###### Safety
All enrolled subjects were analyzed for safety and reactogenicity throughout the study. This corresponded to 100% subjects
in each group for the first vaccination and 93% to 95% across vaccine groups after the second vaccination (Safety Set). Three subjects from the ATIV group and 2 subjects from the TIV group did
not receive the second vaccination at day 29 and were therefore
excluded from the safety analysis for the second vaccination.
Solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) were
recorded for 7 days after each vaccination. Unsolicited AEs were
recorded throughout the entire study period (days 1–50).

###### HI Assay
HI antibodies were measured as previously described. Antibody titers were measured to the influenza strains homologous
(A/H1N1/California/07/2009, A/H3N2/Victoria/210/2009 and B/
Brisbane/60/2008) and heterologous (A/H3N2/Uruguay/716/2007
and B/Malaysia/2506/2004) to those present in the study vaccines.
Results were evaluated as seroconversion (defined as a change in
HI titer of <1:10 on day 1 to an HI titer ≥1:40 on day 50) or a significant increase in HI titers (defined as a 4-fold or greater increase
in titer in a subject with a day 1 titer ≥1:10); geometric mean ratio
of HI geometric mean titer on postvaccination/prevaccination; and
seroprotection (defined as the proportion of subjects achieving an
HI titer ≥1:40 postvaccination). When the results were evaluated
using the criteria of the Committee for Medicinal Products for
Human Use (CHMP), the adult criteria were used since no CHMP
criteria exist for children: (1) the proportion of subjects achieving
seroconversion or a significant increase in HI titer should be >40%;
(2) the geometric mean ratio should be >2.5; (3) the proportion
of subjects achieving an HI titer ≥1:40 postvaccination should be
>70%. In addition, seroprotection rates were also analyzed using
higher antibody thresholds,[13] based on the data previously reported.[4]


Analysis was performed on both the Full Analysis Set
(FAS) and the PPS. No difference was found between the 2
data sets.

###### Measurement of T-cell Responses by Intracellular Cytokine Staining
CD4[+] T-cell responses were measured by intracellular staining and flow cytometry at baseline and at day 50.[11] Purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated overnight,
in vitro, with the subunit antigens (1 μg/mL) from the following homologous (A/H1N1/California/07/2009, A/H3N2/Victoria/210/2009 and B/Brisbane/60/2008) and heterologous strains
(B/Florida/4/2006) in the presence of anti-human aCD28/CD49d
antibodies (1 μg/mL; BD Bioscience, Sparks, MD) and brefeldin
A (5 μg/mL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). After overnight stimulation,
PBMCs were stained with Live Dead (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA),
then fixed, permeabilized and stained with anti-human antibodies to CD3 (clone SK7; BD Bioscience), CD4 (clone RPA-T4;
BD Bioscience); IL-2 (clone 5344.111; BD Bioscience), IFN-γ
(clone 4S.B3; BD Bioscience) and TNF-α (clone MAb11; BD
Bioscience). Samples were acquired on a fluorescence-activated
cell sorter BD LSR II analyzer. Results were analyzed blind using
FlowJo software (Tree Star Software, Ashland, OR). The frequency
and cytokine profile of antigen-specific CD4[+] T cells was calculated
by summing the frequency of CD4[+] T cells producing all nonoverlapping permutations of the cytokines tested (Boolean and logical
gates with FlowJo). Data are expressed as number of antigen-specific CD4[+] T cells per million of total CD4[+] T cells. Analysis was
performed on both the FAS and the PPS. No difference was found
between the 2 data sets.

###### Statistics
Distributions of HI titers are typically skewed to the right.
However, log-transformed immunogenicity values are usually
approximately normally distributed and so this transformation
(base 10) was applied to all titers.
CD4[+] T-cell response variables were statistically analyzed in
a similar way as the logarithmic transformed titers.
Values below the limit of detection were set to half that.
Means and differences (ie, within vaccine group between visits
and between vaccine groups across visits, respectively) and pertaining 95% confidence intervals were calculated using an analysis
of covariance with vaccine group as a qualitative factor and while
adjusting for age cohort and changes in baseline values.
Statistical inferences between vaccination groups were
determined using the JMP software. Pairwise differences were
evaluated by the Tukey–Kramer test on log normalized values, as
described above. The level of significance for the statistical analysis
will be set at 5% (P ≤ 0.05).
All statistical-related analyses results were transformed
back to be finally presented in the same unit as measured.

###### RESULTS

 Safety
Consistent with previous studies,[6,7,14] most of the reported
local and systemic AEs were mild to moderate in intensity and
resolved within a few days of vaccination. The proportion of subjects reporting solicited AEs was higher in the group that received
[ATIV (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.](http://links.lww.com/INF/B945)
[com/INF/B945) while the incidence of unsolicited AEs was com-](http://links.lww.com/INF/B945)
parable in the 2 vaccine groups (see Table, Supplemental Digital
[Content 2, http://links.lww.com/INF/B946). The most commonly](http://links.lww.com/INF/B946)
reported local AE after the first vaccine dose was tenderness at the


-----

site of injection. There were no reports of severe local reactions in
response to TIV or ATIV.

###### Antibody Responses
Both TIV and ATIV induced a significant increase of HI
antibodies against the vaccine strains (A/H1N1California, A/
H3N2Victoria and B/Brisbane). ATIV induced a significant
increase of HI antibodies also against strains heterologous to the
ones contained in the vaccine (A/Uruguay and B/Malaysia). HI
antibody titers induced by ATIV were significantly higher than
those induced by TIV for A/H3N2Victoria, B/Brisbane and for
the heterologous B/Malaysia. HI titers for A/H1N1California
were higher after ATIV as compared with TIV, but the difference between the 2 vaccines was not statistically significant (see
[Fig. 1 and Table, Supplemental Digital Content 3–4, http://links.](http://links.lww.com/INF/B947)
[lww.com/INF/B947 and http://links.lww.com/INF/B948). It is](http://links.lww.com/INF/B947)
important to note that prevaccination HI titers were higher for
A/H1N1California compared with A/H3N2Victoria and B/Brisbane (P < 0.0001 by the Tukey–Kramer HSD test). These results
support a previous exposure of vaccinees to A/H1N1California,
which extensively circulated since the 2009 pandemic, but not to
the other strains analyzed in this study.
The serologic results were then evaluated using the criteria
of the CHMP. Since there are no CHMP licensure criteria for influenza vaccines in pediatric age, we applied the ones used in adults
(see Materials and Methods).
All 3 CHMP criteria were met for the influenza A strains
by both TIV and ATIV. For the B strain all 3 criteria were met for
ATIV while in the TIV group seroprotection was not met, with only
57% of children achieving an HI titer ≥1:40 (see Table 1 and Table,
[Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/INF/B947).](http://links.lww.com/INF/B947)
Recently it has been proposed that the adult correlate of seroprotection (HI titer ≥1:40) may not be appropriate in children since
HI titers of 1:40, 1:110 and 1:330 predict 22%, 50% and 80% of
clinical protection, respectively, in this age group.[13] Applying more


stringent criteria of seroprotection, the difference between ATIV
and TIV becomes more obvious with 80% of children in the ATIV
group versus 53% in the TIV group reaching an HI ≥1:330 for A/
H1N1California. Similarly, 92% of children in the ATIV group versus 23% in the TIV group reached an HI ≥1:330 for A/H3N2Victoria and 40% in ATIV versus 10% in TIV for B/Brisbane (see Fig. 2
[and Table, Supplemental Digital Content 4, http://links.lww.com/](http://links.lww.com/INF/B948)
[INF/B948).](http://links.lww.com/INF/B948)

###### CD4[+] T-cell Responses to Vaccination
We then analyzed the impact of vaccination on the frequency and cytokine profile of vaccine-specific CD4[+] T cells. ATIV
induced the expansion of CD4[+] T cells specific for both homologous
(A/H1N1California, A/H3N2Victoria and B/Brisbane) and heterologous (B/Florida) influenza antigens. Conversely, TIV induced a
significant expansion of CD4[+] T cells only for A/H1N1California
and A/H3N2Victoria. The expansion of CD4[+] T cells specific for
A/H1N1California was not significantly different after vaccination
with TIV versus ATIV, whereas the expansion of CD4[+] T cells specific for A/H3N2Victoria or B/Brisbane was significantly higher
after ATIV as compared with TIV (P ≤ 0.0001) (Fig. 3).
The cytokine profile of influenza-specific CD4[+] T cells was
comparable after vaccination with TIV and ATIV and was dominated by the production of IL-2 and TNF-α (Fig. 4). Only a small
percentage of influenza-specific CD4[+] T cells produced IFN-γ and/
or IL-13, and their frequency did not increase after vaccination
and was comparable after vaccination with TIV and ATIV (Fig. 4).
These data in children confirm our previous findings in adults and
the elderly vaccinated with MF59-adjuvanted avian H5N1 or seasonal vaccines on the ability of influenza vaccination to expand
vaccine-specific CD4[+] T cells, especially against those strains to
which the populations have not been exposed and against heterovariant strains.[11,15] They also confirm the ability of MF59 to induce
an increased expansion of vaccine-specific CD4[+] T cells without
modifying their cytokine profile.

###### DISCUSSION
Conventional, nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines have a long
track record of use and success. Despite this, they fail to induce high
and persistent immune responses in immunologically naive individuals. Formulation with adjuvants, especially oil-in-water emulsions
like MF59, enhances the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in
naive individuals like children vaccinated against seasonal influenza[10,16] or adults vaccinated against avian H5N1, an antigen the population has not been exposed to.[11,12,17] In children, MF59-adjuvanted
seasonal influenza vaccines induce stronger and more sustained HI
and neutralizing antibody responses than the conventional nonadjuvanted vaccines and reduce the risk of infections.[4]


Despite the central role of HA-specific antibodies in protection from influenza infection, several reports point at a critical function for T lymphocytes in the direct killing of infected targets and
also in orchestrating the optimal activation of B lymphocytes.[11,12]
We have previously shown that in adults the administration of an
MF59-adjuvanted A/H5N1 vaccine induces a rapid expansion of
vaccine-specific CD4[+] T cells that predicts induction of high antibody responses and immune memory, thus supporting a central role
for helper CD4[+] T cells in the optimal response to vaccination.[11,12]
In this study we show that, in previously unvaccinated children aged 6 to <36 months, the MF59-adjuvanted ATIV induces a
strong immune response, as assessed by the increase in HI antibody

**FIGURE 4.** Cytokine profile of CD4[+] T cells induced by vaccination with TIV and ATIV. Frequency of IFN-γ[+] (gray), IL-2[+]

titers and the expansion of vaccine-specific CD4[+] T lymphocytes.
The cytokine profile of influenza-specific CD4[+] T cells was comparable after TIV and ATIV vaccination, and dominated by IL-2 and
TNF-α-producing CD4[+] T cells. The proportion of CD4[+] T cells
producing IFN-γ, a classic Th1 cytokine, or IL-13, a classic Th2type cytokine, was limited and did not increase following vaccination with either TIV or ATIV. In children, influenza vaccination
does expand antigen-specific CD4[+] T cells with a Th0-like cytokine
profile and the adjuvant MF59 does not bias the immune response
toward either Th1 or Th2. This confirms in children the results
obtained in other age groups on the ability of MF59 to increase
the magnitude of both the antibody and the CD4[+] T-cell response,


without modifying the cytokine profile of vaccine-specific CD4[+] T
cells.[4,7,10,11] However, the observed absence of a Th2 bias is in contradiction with data reporting a strong production of Th2 cytokines
in children, of the same age group, vaccinated with a split influenza vaccine.[18] Differences in the vaccine composition, the use
of seasonal versus avian strains, the age of the children, previous
exposure to the antigen as well as the experimental approaches
used to detect cytokines can influence the quality of the immune
responses.[18,19]
It is noteworthy that MF59-adjuvanted influenza (ATIV)
induced stronger responses than the nonadjuvanted (TIV) vaccines against viruses both homologous (A/H3N2/Victoria and


-----

B/Brisbane) and heterologous (A/H3N2/Uruguay, B/Florida
and B/Malaysia) to the vaccine strains. The immune response to
A/H1N1/California was not statistically different between TIV
and ATIV. We believe that this difference can be explained by
previous exposure of the children to A/H1N1/California but not
to A/H3N2 or to B strains. The clinical study was, in fact, performed between April and December 2011. The pandemic strain
A/H1N1/California spread to Europe in the summer of 2009 and
circulated widely until the spring of 2010. During this time, the
circulation of A/H3N2 strains was minimal; these virus strains
did not reemerge until the beginning of 2012 when this study had
already been concluded.[20] These epidemiologic data, together
with the higher prevaccination HI titers against A/H1N1/California, suggest that most of the children enrolled in this trial had
been exposed to A/H1N1/California and to a lower extent to the
other 2 vaccine strains.
A limitation of this study is represented by the small sample
size which was not powered to detect rare events following immunization. Despite this, the data obtained provide mechanistic insight
into the adaptive immune response of adjuvant added to influenza
vaccines used to vaccinate children and correlate with the safety
profile of MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in children already
reported in larger studies.[4,6,7]
Taken together, the data presented here strongly support
the advantage of using the MF59-adjuvanted ATIV over the nonadjuvanted TIV in priming an immune response in immunologically naive subjects, like young children, and to widen the breadth
of the response to heterologous virus strains. We conclude that
MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccines are safe and immunogenic in
children and support its use in this age group to confer higher and
broader protection in unprimed children.
