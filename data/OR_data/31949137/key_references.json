            "title": "Enhanced immunogenicity of seasonal influenza vaccines in young children using MF59 adjuvant.",
            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nChildren have high morbidity and hospitalization rates from seasonal influenza. Meta-analyses suggest that conventional inactivated influenza vaccines are of low efficacy in young children, making vaccines that induce greater and broader immune protection in this vulnerable population a medical priority. Adjuvanted influenza vaccines may offer a solution.\n## SUBJECTS AND METHODS\nUnprimed healthy children (6 to <36 months) were enrolled in an observer-blinded study and randomly assigned to receive 2 doses of MF59-adjuvanted vaccine (Sub/MF59, n = 130) or nonadjuvanted split vaccine (split, n = 139); subgroups of these (n = 43 and 46, respectively) received a booster dose 1 year later. Safety and clinical tolerability were assessed after each dose. Hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers were measured against influenza A and B strains included in the formulation of the vaccines and against mismatched strains.\n## RESULTS\nClinical tolerability and safety were generally comparable between vaccine groups, though some transient, mild solicited reactions were more frequent in the Sub/MF59 group. Postvaccination hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers to all 3 vaccine strains were significantly higher with Sub/MF59 than with split vaccine (all comparisons P < 0.001) after each of the 3 vaccine doses. In addition, Sub/MF59 induced significantly higher cross-reactivity against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 mismatched strains.\n## CONCLUSION\nMF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine was well tolerated in healthy young children after each of 3 doses and induced greater, longer-lasting, and broader immune responses than a nonadjuvanted split vaccine. The enhanced immunogenicity of the adjuvanted vaccine was most evident in very young children and for the B vaccine strain.\n",

            "abstract": "After priming with two intramuscular doses of MF59-adjuvanted (Sub/MF59) or split influenza vaccines during the 2006/07 season, 89 healthy children received a third booster dose of the respective vaccine (2007/08 Northern Hemisphere formulation) approximately 1 year later, and were followed up for 6 months post-third injection. Immunogenicity was evaluated on 81 of them by a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay before and 3 weeks after vaccination. The Sub/MF59 influenza vaccine was safe and well tolerated following the booster vaccination. Pre-booster HI antibody titers were consistently higher in the Sub/MF59 group than in the comparator group, confirming significantly longer persistence of antibodies after priming with Sub/MF59 vaccine. Post-booster immune responses were significantly higher in the Sub/MF59 group compared with the split group, especially vs. the influenza B strain, which is epidemiologically relevant in the pediatric population. Altogether, these data further support the potential use of MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine as a safe and highly immunogenic influenza vaccine for young children.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThe recent global A/H1N1v pandemic led to major efforts to develop effective vaccines against the novel virus, while global demand and limited production capacity focused attention on dose sparing and schedules.\n## METHODS\nAn open-label phase III study of immunogenicity and safety of novel A/H1N1v vaccines included 392 Costa Rican children in two pediatric cohorts (3-8 and 9-17 years). They received two doses, of either an MF59\u00ae-adjuvanted formulation containing 7.5 \u03bcg antigen or non-adjuvanted formulations containing 15 or 30 \u03bcg antigen, three weeks apart. Immunogenicity was assessed as hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers using the CBER licensure criteria.\n## RESULTS\nAll three vaccines elicited immune responses in 9-17 year-olds meeting CBER criteria three weeks after one dose; responses were not enhanced by second dose. In 3-8 year-olds only the adjuvanted vaccine met the CBER criteria after one dose, but all three vaccines met criteria after second dose. All vaccines were well tolerated; no related Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and few severe solicited reactions were reported. MF59-adjuvanted vaccine was associated with more reports of injection site pain and tenderness and overall systemic solicited reactions, most notably in older subjects, all of which decreased after the second dose.\n## CONCLUSION\nOne dose of non-adjuvanted A/H1N1v vaccine is adequate in 9-17 year-olds, but younger children require either one dose of MF59-adjuvanted vaccine or two doses of non-adjuvanted vaccine to achieve protective titers. Enhanced immunogenicity with MF59 is associated with a small increase in reactogenicity, but no safety issues.\n",

The protection offered to children by conventional trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV) is suboptimal, due to poor immunogenicity and a higher exposure to infection and complications in this age group, particularly from influenza B strains. In this dose-ranging, factorial design trial, we report the safety and immunogenicity of different combinations of adjuvanted (ATIV) and non-adjuvanted trivalent (TIV) and quadrivalent (QIV) influenza vaccines in 480 healthy children 6 to <36 months of age. The results show that the second B strain added to TIV was immunogenic and did not affect immunogenicity of the other strains. The addition of the MF59(\u00ae) adjuvant promoted robust immune responses with notable elevations in antibodies observed even after one dose. A dose-response relationship was observed between the antibody response and MF59 adjuvant. No patterns in safety and tolerability emerged with different adjuvant and antigen doses nor with the addition of a second B strain. MF59-adjuvanted QIV offers potential advantages to young children.\n",

The children were randomly assigned to three study groups, each of which received the assigned vaccines in two doses, 28 days apart, during two consecutive influenza seasons. Two of the groups were given age-appropriate doses of TIV either with or without the MF59 adjuvant, and the third group was given control (noninfluenza) vaccines to assess their absolute and relative efficacy against influenza-like illness, as confirmed by means of polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay.\n## RESULTS\nAttack rates of influenza-like illness across both influenza seasons were 0.7%, 2.8%, and 4.7% in the adjuvant, nonadjuvant, and control vaccine groups, respectively. The absolute vaccine efficacy rates against all influenza strains (94 of 110 cases were due to vaccine-matched H3N2 viruses) were 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74 to 93) for the MF59-adjuvant vaccine (ATIV) and 43% (95% CI, 15 to 61) for the vaccine without the adjuvant (TIV); the relative vaccine efficacy rate for ATIV versus TIV was 75% (95% CI, 55 to 87). The efficacy rates for ATIV were 79% (95% CI, 55 to 90) in children 6 to less than 36 months of age and 92% (95% CI, 77 to 97) in those 36 to less than 72 months of age, as compared with 40% (95% CI, -6 to 66) and 45% (95% CI, 6 to 68), respectively, for TIV. Antibody responses were higher with ATIV and remained so through day 181. The rates of systemic and local reactions to the influenza vaccines with and without the adjuvant were similar in the younger age group (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.09), but systemic events in the older age group were more frequent after administration of ATIV (63%) than after administration of TIV (44%) or the control vaccine (50%). Serious adverse events were distributed evenly across the three vaccine groups.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nInfluenza vaccine with the MF59 adjuvant is efficacious against PCR-confirmed influenza in infants and young children.

Vaccination with aTIV produced slightly higher but acceptable local and systemic reactogenicity compared to TIV-TIV and TIV-aTIV mixed regimens.

Interestingly, the adjuvant MF59 did not modify the cytokine profile of the elicited T cells, characterized by the production of IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1, and did not bias the response toward either Th1 or Th2.

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nYoung children have immature immune systems and respond poorly to standard influenza vaccines. The oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant MF59 can increase antigen uptake, macrophage recruitment, lymph node migration, and avidity to influenza virus. Therefore, we aimed to assess the relative efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of an MF59-adjuvanted, quadrivalent, inactivated (subunit) influenza vaccine (aIIV4) compared with a US-licensed non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in children.\n## METHODS\nWe did a multicentre, randomised controlled, observer-blinded, phase 3 trial of 146 sites including hospitals, clinics, and clinician offices in nine countries over two influenza seasons. We included children of either sex aged 6 months through 5 years. We stratified eligible participants and randomly assigned them (1:1), using a block size of four, to receive either aIIV4 or non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (ie, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV3] or quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV4]). We masked participants, parents or guardians, and outcome assessors to the administered vaccine. Designated personnel who were not masked administered aIIV4 in both seasons, or IIV3 in season one and IIV4 in season two. All vaccinations were administered intramuscularly. Children aged 6 through 35 months received one or two 0\u00b725 mL doses, whereas those aged 3 through 5 years received one or two doses of 0\u00b75 mL. The number of doses was dependent on previous vaccination status: vaccine-naive participants received a total of two doses of study vaccine, the first on day 1 and the second on day 29, whereas non-naive participants received only one dose on day 1. The primary outcome was relative vaccine efficacy assessed by RT-PCR-confirmed influenza due to any influenza strain in the overall study population and in prespecified age and dose subgroups. Immunogenicity against homologous and heterologous strains of influenza and safety were also measured. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01964989.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Nov 3, 2013, and March 5, 2014 (season one), and between Sept 30, 2014, and March 29, 2015 (season two), 10\u2008644 participants were enrolled in this study. Of these participants, 10\u2008612 were vaccinated (n=5338 with aIIV4 and n=5274 with comparator). Relative vaccine efficacy was not different between aIIV4 and the comparator vaccines in the overall study population (relative vaccine efficacy -0\u00b767, 95% CI -19\u00b781 to 15\u00b741). The relative vaccine efficacy in the 6 through 23-month subgroup was significantly greater for aIIV4 than for the comparator vaccine (relative vaccine efficacy 31\u00b737, 95% CI 3\u00b714-51\u00b738). aIIV4 elicited superior immunogenic response compared with the comparator for all four vaccine strains (geometric mean titre ratios 1\u00b791 [95% CI 1\u00b78-2\u00b70] for A/H1N1, 1\u00b771 [1\u00b76-1\u00b78] for A/H3N2, 2\u00b719 [2\u00b70-2\u00b74] for B/Yamagata, and 2\u00b727 [2\u00b70-2\u00b76] for B/Victoria) and three heterologous strains (1\u00b794 [1\u00b76-2\u00b73] for A/H3N2, 2\u00b717 [1\u00b78-2\u00b76] for B/Yamagata, and 2\u00b712 [1\u00b76-2\u00b77] for B/Victoria) in participants aged 6 months through 5 years. The highest geometric mean titre ratios were observed in participants aged 6 through 23 months. Safety profiles were similar but more frequent solicited adverse events were reported with aIIV4 than with the comparator (3748 [73%] of 5138 vs 3242 [64%] of 5056).\n## INTERPRETATION\nAlthough there was no additional benefit of aIIV4 compared with the US-licensed non-adjuvanted influenza vaccines in the overall study population, in the youngest and most vulnerable population of children in this trial, aIIV4 provided greater protection against influenza than a non-adjuvanted vaccine when assessed in this prespecified age group of 6 through 23 months. Additional clinical benefit was also apparent early after first vaccination in vaccine-naive participants aged 6 months through 5 years. Finally, aIIV4 and comparator had similar efficacy and vaccine safety profiles in children aged 6 months through 5 years.\n## FUNDING\nSeqirus UK Ltd.\n",

            "abstract": "The poor immune response elicited by trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) in children can be enhanced by the addition of adjuvants. This observer-blind, randomized Phase III trial assessed the immunogenicity and safety of the MF59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine FLUAD\u00ae (aTIV) and a non-adjuvanted TIV, in healthy children (aged 6 to <72\u00a0months) from 3 centers in Mexico, during the 2014-2015 season. The primary objectives were to assess the non-inferiority of aTIV to TIV, measured by geometric mean titers (GMTs), and the safety of aTIV and TIV. Seroconversion was one of several secondary objectives. In total, 287 children were enrolled. The non-inferiority criteria for GMTs and seroconversion were met for aTIV for all 3 vaccine strains. Lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals for all 3 aTIV:TIV vaccine ratios were >2, showing that the immunogenicity of aTIV was superior to that of TIV for all 3 strains. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were experienced more frequently with aTIV than TIV by younger children (aged 6 to <36\u00a0months), but were more frequent with TIV than aTIV in older children (aged 36 to <72\u00a0months) who had been vaccinated previously. More unsolicited AEs were associated with aTIV than the TIV. All AEs were of mild or moderate severity. No deaths, serious AEs, or AEs leading to premature withdrawal were reported. Overall, aTIV was highly immunogenic and was well tolerated in healthy children 6 to <72\u00a0months of age. These results indicate that aTIV may be a beneficial addition to national pediatric vaccination programs.\n",

            "abstract": "## INTRODUCTION\nEffective, programmatically suitable influenza vaccines are needed for low-resource countries.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis phase II, placebo-controlled, randomized safety and immunogenicity trial (NCT01819155) was conducted in Senegal using the 2012-2013 Northern Hemisphere trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) formulation. Participants were allocated in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive TIV (full-dose for all age groups), adjuvanted TIV (aTIV), or placebo. Participants were stratified into age groups: 6-11, 12-35, and 36-71\u202fmonths. All participants were vaccine-na\u00efve and received two doses of study vaccine 4\u202fweeks apart. The two independent primary objectives were to estimate the immunogenicity of TIV and of aTIV as the proportion of children with a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer of \u22651:40 to each vaccine strain at 28\u202fdays post-dose two. Safety was evaluated by solicited local and systemic reactions, unsolicited adverse events, and serious adverse events.\n## RESULTS\n296 children received TIV, aTIV, or placebo, and 235 were included in the final analysis. After two doses, children aged 6-11, 12-35, and 36-71\u202fmonths receiving TIV had HI titers \u22651:40 against A/H1N1 (73.1%, 94.1%, and 97.0%), A/H3N2 (96.2%, 100.0%, and 100.0%), and B (80.8%, 97.1%, and 97.0%), respectively. After two doses, 100% children aged 6-11, 12-35, and 36-71\u202fmonths receiving aTIV had \u22651:40 titers against A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B. After a single dose, the aTIV response was comparable to or greater than the TIV response for all vaccine strains. TIV and aTIV reactogenicity were similar, except for mild elevation in temperature (37.5-38.4\u202f\u00b0C) which occurred more frequently in aTIV than TIV after each vaccine dose. TIV and aTIV had similarly increased pain/tenderness at the injection site compared to placebo.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBoth aTIV and full-dose TIV were well-tolerated and immunogenic in children aged 6-71\u202fmonths. These vaccines may play a role in programmatically suitable strategies to prevent influenza in low-resource settings.\n",

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVES\nTo compare the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an adjuvanted split virion H1N1 vaccine and a non-adjuvanted whole virion vaccine used in the pandemic immunisation programme in the United Kingdom.\n## DESIGN\nOpen label, randomised, parallel group, phase II study.\n## SETTING\nFive UK centres (Oxford, Southampton, Bristol, Exeter, and London).\n## PARTICIPANTS\nChildren aged 6 months to less than 13 years for whom a parent or guardian had provided written informed consent and who were able to comply with study procedures were eligible. Those with laboratory confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza or clinically diagnosed disease meriting antiviral treatment, allergy to egg or any other vaccine components, or coagulation defects, or who were severely immunocompromised or had recently received blood products were excluded. Children were grouped by age: 6 months-<3 years (younger group) and 3-<13 years (older group). Recruitment was by media advertising and direct mailing. Recruitment visits were attended by 949 participants, of whom 943 were enrolled and 937 included in the per protocol analysis.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nParticipants were randomised 1:1 to receive AS03(B) (tocopherol based oil in water emulsion) adjuvanted split virion vaccine derived from egg culture or non-adjuvanted whole virion vaccine derived from cell culture. Both were given as two doses 21 days apart. Reactogenicity data were collected for one week after immunisation by diary card. Serum samples were collected at baseline and after the second dose.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nPrimary reactogenicity end points were frequency and severity of fever, tenderness, swelling, and erythema after vaccination. Immunogenicity was measured by microneutralisation and haemagglutination inhibition assays. The primary immunogenicity objective was a comparison between vaccines of the percentage of participants showing seroconversion by the microneutralisation assay (fourfold rise to a titre of >or=1:40 from before vaccination to three weeks after the second dose).\n## RESULTS\nSeroconversion rates were higher after the adjuvanted split virion vaccine than after the whole virion vaccine, most notably in the youngest children (163 of 166 participants with paired serum samples (98.2%, 95% confidence interval 94.8% to 99.6%) v 157 of 196 (80.1%, 73.8% to 85.5%), P<0.001) in children under 3 years and 226 of 228 (99.1%, 96.9% to 99.9%) v 95.9%, 92.4% to 98.1%, P=0.03) in those over 3 years). The adjuvanted split virion vaccine was more reactogenic than the whole virion vaccine, with more frequent systemic reactions and severe local reactions in children aged over 5 years after dose one (13 (7.2%, 3.9% to 12%) v 2 (1.1%, 0.1% to 3.9%), P<0.001) and dose two (15 (8.5%, 4.8% to 13.7%) v 2 (1.1%, 0.1% to 4.1%), P<0.002) and after dose two in those under 5 years (15 (5.9%, 3.3% to 9.6%) v 0 (0.0%, 0% to 1.4%), P<0.001). Dose two of the adjuvanted split virion vaccine was more reactogenic than dose one, especially for fever >or=38 masculineC in those aged under 5 (24 (8.9%, 5.8% to 12.9%) v 57 (22.4%, 17.5% to 28.1%), P<0.001).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn this first direct comparison of an AS03(B) adjuvanted split virion versus whole virion non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine, the adjuvanted vaccine, while more reactogenic, was more immunogenic and, importantly, achieved high seroconversion rates in children aged less than 3 years. This indicates the potential for improved immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in this age group.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinical trials.gov NCT00980850; ISRCTN89141709.\n",
