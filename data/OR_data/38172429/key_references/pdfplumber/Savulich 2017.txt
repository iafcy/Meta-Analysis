Abstract
Background: Cognitive training is effective in patients with mild cognitive impairment but does not typically address the
motivational deficits associated with older populations with memory difficulties.
Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of cognitive training using a novel memory game on an iPad in 42
patients with a diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment assigned to either the cognitive training (n = 21; 8 hours of
gameplay over 4 weeks) or control (n = 21; clinic visits as usual) groups.
Results: Significant time-by-pattern-by-group interactions were found for cognitive performance in terms of the number of errors
made and trials needed on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Paired Associates Learning task (P = .044;
P = .027). Significant time-by-group interactions were also found for the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery
Paired Associates Learning first trial memory score (P = .002), Mini-Mental State Examination (P = .036), the Brief Visuospatial
Memory Test (P = .032), and the Apathy Evaluation Scale (P = .026). Within-group comparisons revealed highly specific effects of
cognitive training on episodic memory. The cognitive training group maintained high levels of enjoyment and motivation to
continue after each hour of gameplay, with self-confidence and self-rated memory ability improving over time.
Conclusions: Episodic memory robustly improved in the cognitive training group. “Gamified” cognitive training may also
enhance visuospatial abilities in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Gamification maximizes engagement with
cognitive training by increasing motivation and could complement pharmacological treatments for amnestic mild cognitive
impairment and mild Alzheimer’s disease. Larger, more controlled trials are needed to replicate and extend these findings.

Significance Statement
Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has been described as the transitional stage between healthy ageing and dementia.
aMCI is characterized by day-to-day memory difficulties and motivational problems. At present, there are no effective pharma-
cological treatments for the cognitive impairments of patients with aMCI. Cognitive training has shown benefits, but training
packages are typically repetitive and boring. To maximize engagement with training, we developed a novel memory game in col-
laboration with patients with aMCI and tested its effects on cognition and motivation. We found that patients who played “Game
Show” on an iPad for 8 hours over the course of 4 weeks showed improved episodic memory (memories of locations and events)
compared with patients who attended clinic as usual. High levels of enjoyment and motivation were also maintained throughout
all hours of gameplay. “Gamified” cognitive training can thus be used to enhance memory and motivation in patients with aMCI.
