Cognition to follow a 120 min per week balance, strength and cognitive training program delivered via an app on an iPad.
Falls Both the intervention and control group received monthly phone calls and health fact sheets. The primary
outcome measure was gait speed. Secondary measures included dual-task gait speed, balance (step test, FISCIT-
4), 5 sit to stand test, cognition (executive function, memory, attention), mood and balance confidence.
Adherence, safety, usability and feedback were also measured.
Results: The planned sample size of 110 was not reached due to COVID-19 restrictions. A total of 93 (mean age
72.8 SD 7.0 years) participants were randomised to the two groups. Of these 77 participants returned to the
follow-up clinic. In intention-to-treat analysis for gait speed, there was a non-significant improvement favouring
the intervention group (β 0.04 m/s 95% CI -0.01, 0.08). There were no significant findings for secondary out-
comes. Adherence was excellent (84.5%), usability of the app high (76.7% SD 15.3) and no serious adverse
events were reported. Feedback on the app was positive and included suggestions for future updates.
Conclusion: Due to COVID-19 the trial was under powered to detect significant results. Despite this, there was a
trend towards improvement in the primary outcome measure. The excellent adherence and positive feedback
about the app suggest a fully powered trial is warranted.
