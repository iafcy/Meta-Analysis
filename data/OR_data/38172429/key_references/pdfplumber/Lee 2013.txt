and at three-month follow-up was achieved using primary outcomes on the Chinese Mini-Mental
State Examination, Chinese Dementia Rating Scale, Hong Kong List Learning Test, and the
Brief Assessment of Prospective Memory-Short Form. Secondary outcomes were the Modified
Barthel Index, Hong Kong Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, and Geriatric
Depression Scale-Short Form. The data were analyzed using Friedman’s test for time effect and
the Kruskal-Wallis test for treatment effect.
Results: Positive treatment effects on cognition were found in two errorless learning-based
memory groups (ie, computer-assisted and therapist-led). Remarkable changes were shown in
cognitive function for subjects receiving CELP and emotional/daily functions in those receiv-
ing TELP.
Conclusion: Positive changes in the cognitive function of Chinese patients with early Alzheimer’s
disease were initially found after errorless training through CELP. Further enhancement of the
training program is recommended.
