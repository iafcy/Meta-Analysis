training required discriminating studied words from non-studied lures that were
repeated at varying intervals during the test phase. Participants were assessed pre/
post using untrained measures of cognition and self-report questionnaires. Primary
outcome measures were recall of unrelated word pairs both immediately following

completed the study (twelve in each group). Results indicated that the training group
improved at recalling unrelated word pairs after a delay. There were no significant

Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) involves significant impairments on objec-
tive measures of memory compared with age-matched peers but with intact activities of
daily living (Petersen, 2004). Impairments can be restricted to memory alone or include
deficits in other areas of cognition such as visuospatial ability, executive functions and
language.Theriskofconversiontodementiaishighinthisgroup(Ravagliaetal.,2006),

memory failures in a range of situations. By identifying these processes, it may be
possible to provide training interventions that are both more efficient and more likely to
transfer to other recall situations that rely on the trained process.
There is an extensive literature on memory processes in both normal elderly and in
memory-impaired groups. One area of investigation, dual-process theory (Jacoby, 1991;
Mandler, 1980) has drawn a distinction between controlled (conscious, effortful) and
automatic (unconscious, implicit) processes. The recognition memory literature has
further distinguished between the automatic process “familiarity” (for example, knowing
you have seen someone before without conscious recollection as to where) and a
controlled process known as “recollection” (retaining memory of the contextual informa-
tion, e.g., they were the person who sold you tickets to a concert). There is evidence that
normal elderly, aMCI and Alzheimer’s disease groups (Adam, Van der Linden, Collette,
Lemauvais, & Salmon, 2005; Jennings & Jacoby, 1997; Smith & Knight, 2002) are less
able to engage processes underlying recollection, instead tending to rely more on famil-
iarity. This suggests that recollection might be a suitable target for remediation via
systematictrainingthatencouragesbothdeeperencodingandretentionofthisinformation
over a period of time.
Repetition-lag training
Onemethodoftrainingrecollectionisrepetition-lagtraining(RLT),aformofrecognition
memory training that encourages recollection over mere familiarity. The RLT procedure
requires the learning of a series of words and subsequent discrimination of those words
from unstudied lures. The task differs from a straightforward recognition task in that the
luresarerepeatedatvaryingintervalsknownaslags,andthelengthofthelagincreasesas
performance improves.
Initial studies (Jacoby, Jennings, & Hay, 1996; Jennings & Jacoby, 2003) using RLT
involved normal elderly and suggested that problems in recollection on the RLTwere (1)
related to self-reported memory complaints, (2) that recollection could be improved with
training, and (3) the training effect was driven by incremented difficulty. Incremented
difficulty occurs when the lags are systematically increased once a criterion level of
performance is reached. This progressive increase in task difficulty is thought to force
participants to develop and/or practice strategies to recollect at longer intervals. Jennings
and Jacoby (2003) found that when intervals were systematically increased in this way,
recollection improved more than when the intervals were varied randomly.
Transferof training
ThereisencouragingevidenceoftransferfollowingRLT.Forexample,Jennings,Webster,
Kleykamp, and Dagenbach (2005) reported gains on n-back task (a measure of working
memory), the Source discrimination task (visual long-term memory), Digit-symbol sub-
stitution (processing speed), and the Self-ordered pointing test (non-spatial executive
working memory). In another study using a modified form of RLT (Lustig & Flegal,
2008) gains were found on Trails B (cognitive flexibility) along with a reduction in self-
reported memory errors as measured by theEveryday Memory Questionnaire. In a group
with Alzheimer’s disease (Boller, Jennings, Dieudonné, Verny, & Ergis, 2012) transfer
gains were seen on an n-back task (working memory), RL/R1 (episodic recognition
memory), DMS 48 task (visual recognition memory), and the source recognition task
(recognition memory). One conference report found gains in a group with aMCI on the
246 M. Finn and S. McDonald
California Verbal Learning Test – Second Edition (CVLT-II) measures of immediate and
delayed, free and cued recall (Jennings et al., 2006). Encouragingly, the transfer effects
observed in these studies do not appear to be due to expectancy effects or social contact,
asactivecontrolgroupscompletingarecognitionpracticetaskdidnotshowsimilargains.

that recollection is impaired in this population and that successful training may have
beneficial effects across a range of recall situations encountered in everyday life.
Optimizing RLT for older adults
Under the original RLT procedure, encoding time is limited to 2 seconds per word.
Bissig and Lustig (2007) found that under a modified RLT procedure, with open-ended
encoding time, the time spent on encoding was the major determinant of performance
rather than factors such as age or crystallized intelligence. This appeared to be due to
how the time at encoding was used. Participants who spontaneously utilized a self-
generatedstrategytoaidlearningperformedbetterthanthosewhodidnotorthosewho
simply relied on repetition. The observation that a self-generated memory strategy may
improve performance, echoes work by Derwinger, Stigsdotter-Neely, MacDonald, and
Backman (2005), where elderly participants who came up with their own strategy
retained numerical information for longer periods compared with peers who were
given a specific mnemonic strategy to aid recall. This finding was subsequently tested
by Lustig and Flegal (2008) who increased encoding time to 14 second, and instructed
participants to either make a sentence out of each word, or to think about the meaning
of the word, without offering a specific strategy. They found that allowing participants
to choose their own strategy during extended encoding aided performance compared
with being instructed on which strategy to use. Given this, it seems reasonable to
suggest that optimizing performance of an aMCI sample on the RLT procedure could
involve encouraging participants to think of some way to remember the words (while
leavingtheexactmethodfordoingsoopen)andextendingtheencodingperiodforeach
word to allow sufficient time for this to occur.
Taken together, the existing research literature suggests that RLT targets a process
known to be impaired in aMCI, and that there is some evidence of transfer following
training.Theadaptedprocedurewithextendedencodingtimeallowstime forparticipants
to generate their own strategy. However, these effects have yet to be tested in an aMCI
group despite calls to do so (Anderson et al., 2008; Ranganath, Flegal, & Kelly, 2011;
Shumaker, Legault, & Coker, 2006).

To ensure that improvements on the training task did, in fact, reflect improve-
ments in recollection it was also hypothesized that there would be no change in
eitheraccuracyorresponsebiasacrosstraining.Ifrecollectionaloneisimproving
then accuracy (proportion of “hits,” i.e., saying yes to a studied word; minus
proportion of false alarms, responding “yes” to a new word) should not change
across training. Such a finding would suggest that improvements during training
are due to a change in the ability to correctly discriminate studied words from

repeated lures (recollection). Changes in response bias could indicate that parti-
cipantssimplylearnedtorespond“no”moreoftenwithouttrulyrecollectingifthe
word was from the studied list or a new word.
(2) To measure transfer gains in recollection following training. It was hypothesized
that aMCI participants would show improved recollection following RLT.
Recollection was operationalized as recall of unrelated word pairs, both immedi-
atelyfollowingpresentationandagainafteradelay.TheVerbalPairedAssociates
Test (from the Wechsler Memory Scale – Fourth Edition, Wechsler, 2009) con-
tains both related (“sock-shoe”) and unrelated word pairs (“laugh-stand”). This
task is known to be sensitive to the kinds of memory impairment seen in aMCI
(Perri, Carlesimo, Serra, &Caltagirone,2005), and recallof unrelated word pairs

Rouch-Leroyer, Fabrigoule, & Dartigues, 2000).
(3) To extend findings by other researchers that RLT may improve working memory
(measured here by Symbol Span) and cognitive flexibility (Trails B). Finally, we
explored the effect of training on self-reported everyday cognitive failures
(Cognitive Failures Questionnaire) and on mood (DASS-21). It was thought
that RLT may result in reduced frequency of self-reported cognitive failures. A
measureofmoodwasincludedtogaugetheimpact(eitherpositiveornegative)of

typically involved a physical exam, clinical history, detailed neuropsychological testing
and cerebral imaging. Participants were excluded due to reasons such as having a
diagnosis other than aMCI, co-morbid psychiatric problems, having moved outside the
boundaries of the area health service, progression to dementia, or recent commencement
on a cholinesterase inhibitor. Participants gave written informed consent in accordance
withHREArequirements.AsaMCIisanunstablediagnosis,toensurethatallparticipants
continued to meet the criteria for aMCI the remaining potential participants were further
screened as per the following criteria:
(1) Diagnosis of amnestic MCI (single or multiple domain). Participants with non-
amnestic MCI were not eligible to participate. MCI was determined using stan-
dardized diagnostic criteria (Winblad et al., 2004). All participants had a recent
(<12 months old) neuropsychological evaluation that indicated objective impair-
ments in memory (at least 1.5 SD below age and education related normative
data).
(2) Intact global cognitive functioning (score >23) on the Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE) (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975); absence of
untreated psychiatric illness or substance abuse problems; and absence of visual,
auditory or motor impairment that would hinder use of a computer. Participants

withdrawals all occurred after randomization but prior to commencing the study. The
primary reasons for withdrawal were unrelated medical or personal issues. Those who
withdrew did not differ from those who completed the study in terms of age, sex,
education, or depressive symptoms. In the treatment group, two participants were
excluded, one because his memory functioning was not sufficiently impaired to meet
the study criteria, despite a clinical presentation in keeping with aMCI. Another
participant was excluded as she was unable to complete the training within the five
week time-frame permitted. In the control group, one participant was excluded due to a

Materials and procedure
The repetition-lag training procedure was broadly similar to that outlined by Lustig and
Flegal (2008). Computer files that provided the repetition-lag training algorithm were
kindly provided by Kristin Flegal. Words were sourced from the MRC Psycholinguistic
database (located on UWA website http://www.psy.uwa.edu.au/mrcdatabase/uwa_mrc.
htm). From this, word lists for the experiment were randomly generated via an Excel
macro. Each list had 30 words and two lists were used for each round of training (30
wordstobestudied,30wordsaslures).Wordlistswerebalancedintermsofwordlength
F(1,46) = .992, P = .489 and frequency F(1,46) = 1.232, P = .139. The experiment was
generated using E-Prime software (version 2.0; Psychological Software Tools, Inc.).
Within the constraints set by the lag-length, the rate of repeated lures was random, and
was randomized uniquely for each participant.
Eachtrainingsessioncomprisedfourroundsoftrainingwiththeexceptionofthefinal
session which had three. Within each session there was an initial study phase where 30
words were presented one at a time for 14 seconds each, followed by a test phase where

of 85% studied words correctly recognized and 85% of unstudied words correctly
rejected.Participantswereinstructedtowritedowntheirpercentagescoreforbothstudied

After a practice round on the training task, training was then completed over the
following six sessions. A final session was devoted to post-treatment measures. The
control group attended twice to complete pre and post-treatment measures.
Primary outcome measures
The primary outcome measures comprised both immediate and delay scores from the
Verbal Paired Associates Test (Wechsler Memory Scale – Fourth Edition, Wechsler,
2009). While all participants had prior neuropsychological testing, none had previous
exposure to this task.
VPAI–Thissubtestassessesverbalmemoryforassociatedwordpairs.After10word
pairs are read to the participant, the first word of each pair is read and the participant is
askedtoprovidethewordthatitwaspairedwith.Thesamelistofwordpairsispresented
over four trials, in a different order each time. If a participant responds incorrectly, the
correct word pair is re-stated. Correct responses are affirmed (“That’s right”) by the
Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition 251
examiner. Six of the word pairs are unrelated words, (e.g., “laugh-stand”) four of the
word-pairsarerelatedwords(“sock-shoe”).Recallofunrelatedwordpairswasusedasthe

VPA II – The delayed condition assesses long-term recall of the word pairs. After a
delay of 20–30 minutes, the first word of each pair is again read and the participant is
asked to state the word that goes with it. Only a single trial is administered and no
feedback is given during this test.
Secondary outcome measures
SymbolSpan:takenfromtheWechslerMemoryScale–FourthEdition(Wechsler,2009).
This subtest assesses visual working memory using novel visual stimuli. Beginning with
two symbols, abstract visual symbols are exposed for 5 seconds. In the test phase, the
participant has to correctly recall not only the correct symbols from distractor items, but
also the order in which they were presented from left to right. The number of symbols
presentedincreasesbyoneatintervalsasthetestprogresses.Higherscoresindicatebetter

Number Sequencing and Number-Letter switching: These tests are taken from the
Delis–Kaplan Executive Function System Test Battery (D-KEFS; Delis, Kaplan, &
Kramer, 2001) and mirror the well-known Trail Making Part A and Part B. In Number

Number-Letterswitching,thetaskistoswitchbetweenconnectingnumbersandletters,in
order, from lowest to highest, e.g., 1-A, 2-B, 3-C etc., and is a measure of cognitive
flexibility. Data collected for each test is the time taken (seconds) to complete the task.
Higher scores indicate poorer performance on these measures.
Everyday cognitive functioning was measured by the Cognitive Failures
Questionnaire (Broadbent, Fitzgerald, Cooper, & Parkes, 1982) which is a reliable and

specific problem has occurred ranging from 4 = “very often” to 0 = “never”. The scores
are then added to arrive at a total score (Possible range 0–100). Higher scores indicate
more frequent cognitive failures.
Mood was measured using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (Lovibond &

Data analysis
All analyses were carried out using SPSS Statistics – version 21. Planned analyses
included the following:
(1) A paired samples t-test to check that participants progressed through the training
levels by completion of training.

(2) A one-way repeated-measures ANOVA to check that levels of accuracy on the
recognition task did not change across training.
(3) Aone-wayrepeated-measuresANOVAofresponsebiasacrossthesixsessionsof

(4) Treatment effects were assessed using 2 (group) × 2 (pre and post) repeated
measures ANCOVAs, for each of the primary and secondary outcome variables
with diagnosis (single or multiple domain aMCI) included as a covariate. A
treatment effect was defined as a significant group × time interaction.
Results
Training task data
Data for hits, false alarms, accuracy and response bias are presented in Table 3.
Training outcome
To assess theeffectivenessofrecollection training, theRLTlevel reached (possiblerange

withthelevelreachedbytheendofthefinalsession(M=6.75,SD=3.01)usingapaired
samplest-test. Thisshowedasignificant improvementinRLTlevel between thefirst and
last day of training, t(11) =−6.65, P < .001. This indicates that participants improved on
the task itself over the course of training. All participants were able to progress at least
twofurtherlaglevelsbeyondthelevelreachedattheendofthefirstsession,andeightof
the twelve participants progressed at least four levels.
Accuracy
To check that the task improvements were actually due to improved recollection rather
than simplydue topracticeeffects,i.e., increased accuracy, aone-way repeated measures
ANOVA was conducted on accuracy across all six sessions of training. The results
indicated no significant change in accuracy ratings over the course of training F
(5,270) = .409, P = .842.
Response bias
As the probability of correct responses is not equally distributed between “yes” and “no”

Outcome data
All outcome variables were checked foroutliers,normality and sphericity.Therewereno
outliers detected using boxplots, and Mauchly’s test of Sphericity was non-significant in
all cases. Where some variables were positively skewed, tests of skewness and kurtosis
werewithinreasonablebounds(Skewnessandkurtosisvalueswerebothwithin±bounds

Correlationsbetween thebaselinevariablesandtheoutcomemeasureswereobtained.
Baseline MMSE score was not significantly correlated with both primary outcomes and
nor were other baseline variables such as age, years of education. While a chi-square test
confirmedthatdiagnosis(singlevsmultipledomainaMCI)didnotdifferbetweengroups

and interaction effects for all measures are provided in Table 5. On the measures of
recollection, recall of unrelated word pairs immediately following presentation was not
significantlyaffectedbytraining.However,onthedelayedmeasure,resultsofarepeated-
measures ANCOVA revealed a significant group × time interaction with the training
group improving their recall of unrelated word pairs, while the control group declined.
The eta squared statistic (.17) indicated a modest effect size. Recall of related word-pairs
(which were not expected to change) was not affected by training either immediately
following presentation F(1,21) = 1.75, P = .200 or after a delay F(1,21) = .35, P = .361.
Secondary outcomes
There were no significant group by time interactions on measures of either attention or
cognitive flexibility as measured by Number sequencing and Number-Letter switching.
Norwasthereasignificantinteractiononthemeasureofvisualworkingmemory(Symbol
Span). Inspection of means suggested that the lack of significant group by time interac-
tionsonbothNumbersequencingandSymbolSpancouldhavebeenduetolowpower,so
further exploratory analyses were carried out. Paired samples t-tests revealed that for
Symbol Span the training group improved their performance following training t
(11) = −2.68, P = .021, while the control group did not t(11) = −.367, P = .720.
Results for Number sequencing were non-significant for both groups. Both self-reported
everyday cognitive failures and mood were unaffected by training, with no significant
group by time interactions.
Discussion
To the author’s knowledge this is the first study using the modified RLT program
described by Lustig and Flegal (2008) in a group of people with aMCI. The study builds
Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition 255
onanexistingbodyofresearchwhichsuggeststhatRLTimprovesrecollectiononthetask
itself, and may also transfer to untrained measures.
The modified RLT program proved effective as participants were able to increase the
lag at which they could correctly discriminate unstudied from studied words to criterion
levels of accuracy. These improvements cannot be attributed to practice effects nor to
changes in response bias suggesting that training was effective at improving recollection
onthetaskitself.Takentogether,thesefindingssuggestthatthemodifiedRLTprocedure
may be a robust method of training recollection in aMCI.
ThisstudyaimedtotesttheefficacyofRLTintransferringtoanuntrainedmeasureof
recollection and found an improvement in delayed recall of unrelated word-pairs follow-
ing training. This finding is preliminary and requires further research. However, it is
notable as delayed recall is known to be significantly impaired in aMCI, more so than
immediate recall (Perri et al., 2005) and problems with delayed recall are predictive of
conversion to Alzheimer’s disease in memory clinic patients (Morris, Heyman, Mohs, &
Hughes, 1989; Smith & Rush, 2006; Takayama, 2010). Thus, a group of aMCI partici-
pantswhoarelikelytobeatincreasedriskofprogressiontodementiaimprovedinanarea
of memory known to be impaired following just six sessions of RLT. However, the other
primaryoutcome,immediaterecallofunrelatedwordpairs,didnotimprovewithtraining.
WhiletherearemanydifferencesinhowtheimmediateanddelayedtrialsoftheVPAare
administeredandpresumablyinthecognitiveprocessesengagedatthesetwophases,itis
plausible to suggest that training effects occurred only on the delayed test because RLT
emphasized delayed recollection over more short-term retention. The immediate recall
task also appears to have been too sensitive to practice effects with both treatment and
control groups improving.
None of the secondary outcome measures showed strong evidence of transfer of
training. Lustig and Flegal (2008) previously reported gains following RLT training on
a measure of cognitive flexibility (Trails B). This was an unexpected finding and they
speculated that it could be because RLT actually trains executive control processes
mediated by the prefrontal cortex. However, it was not replicated in this study using a
similar measure (Number-Letter switching) suggesting that it may have simply been an
isolated finding. While previous research has reported gains in measures relating to
working memory such as the Self-Ordered Pointing Test, n-back, and Digit Symbol
Substitution Test (Jennings et al., 2005), we did not find strong evidence of transfer to
a measure of visual working memory (Symbol Span), however there is evidence that this
may have been due to low power.
The self-report data showed no effect of training on either frequency of cognitive
failuresoronmood.Asimprovementsinrecollectionareknowntoberelatedtoeveryday
memory it was disappointing to observe no change in self-reported cognitive failures,
despitetrainingandtransferdataindicatingimprovedrecollection.Onepossiblereasonis
that the measure was not sensitive enough to memory lapses due to recollection failure,
insteadbeingdesignedtolookatcognitivefailuresmoregenerally(sampleitemsinclude,
“Do you have trouble making up your mind?” “Do you daydream when you ought to be
listening?”“Doyoudropthings?”thatmaybeunrelatedtolapsesinrecollection).Inour
study mood was not affected by training. This suggests that while RLT did not boost
mood, exposure to cognitive challenges via training does not appear to have an adverse
effect on self-reported mood.
This study had a number of strengths. It included independently diagnosed and
objectively assessed aMCI participants who were re-screened on entry to the study. The
study used a robust randomized controlled trial design to control for potential bias in
256 M. Finn and S. McDonald
observing treatment effects. Further, it made use of an established training procedure,
optimized for older people and further adapted on the basis of piloting with an aMCI
sample. The study was designed to test the hypothesis that RLTwould improve recollec-
tion not just on the task itself, but also transfer to an untrained measure of recollection.
Primaryoutcomemeasureswerecarefullyselectedandaconservativenumberofanalyses
planned. Secondary analyses were conducted to assess the transfer to other cognitive
domains reported in previous research and to provide some insight into the impact on
frequency of cognitive failures in daily life.
Despite these strong design features, several important qualifications remain. Firstly,
althoughtherewereonlyafewoutcomemeasures,aTypeIerrorcannotberuledout,and
theresultsneed tobereplicated ina largertrial. Secondly,thesize oftheimprovementis
modest,andmay notbeclinicallymeaningful.Onaveragefollowingtraining participants
were able to recall one more word pair than prior to training. Also, theimprovement was
notevenlydistributedacrossallparticipants.Asub-group(thosewhoscored0atbaseline)
didnotimprove,withtheimprovementoccurringinthosewhoscoredbetween1and5at
baseline. The other qualification is that a study of this size is necessarily limited in its
abilitytoseeeffects(raisedTypeIIerror),duetolowstatisticalpower.Anotherlimitation
isthatanactivecontrolgroupwasnotemployed,meaningthattheresultscouldbedueto
factorssuchasexperimentercontact.Thislatterconcernisamelioratedbythefindingthat
previous research with active control groups using RLT have found that recognition
practice with an equivalent amount of contact time does not produce the same training
or transfer gains as RLT (Boller et al., 2012).
The effect of changing the criterion to move from one lag to another is uncertain. In
piloting, four aMCI participants were unable to reach the criterion of 96% correct
rejectionsafterfourroundsoftrainingatentrylevel(lagintervalof1+2)sothethreshold
was reduced to 85%. In the training data this meant that all participants were able to
progresstoatleastlaglevel3(2+4).Analternativetochangingthecriterionwouldhave
been to reduce the number of words in the studied list. However this was avoided as the
extent of improvement on the RLT task itself in an aMCI group was unknown. Most
studiesreportingonthishaveusednormalelderlyparticipants,soreducingthenumberof
words (which necessarily reduces the longest lag possible) may have created an artificial
ceiling on training gains. This was borne out in our data where several participants
reached the highest RLT level possible by completion of training.
The findings here suggest that RLT may be useful for improving recollection in a
group who are impaired in this ability. With the modified procedure, participants are
encouraged to use deep meaning-based processing to encode novel stimuli in a way that
should aid recollection. Ideally, future studies should assess transfer of recollection on a
range of measures, including ones sensitive to everyday recollection failures experienced
in aMCI. This may help to provide a clearer view as to which aspects of recollection
memoryareimprovedbyRLT.Finally,thevariableresponsetotraininghighlightsaneed
tofurtherexploretheroleofimpairedfamiliarityinresponsetotraininginaMCI.Studies
with aMCI and Alzheimer’s disease groups have reported mixed findings with regard to
whether or not familiarity is preserved. Some have reported problems with recollection
alone (Guerdoux, Dressaire, Martin, Adam, & Brouillet, 2012; Serra et al., 2010), while
othersfind problems with both recollection and familiarity (Ally, Gold,& Budson,2009;
Wolk,Signoff,&DeKosky,2008).Attheleast,thosewhohaveimpairmentsinfamiliarity
(on top of problems with recollection) are likely to have more difficulty completing the
RLT procedure. If so, the RLT procedure may need to be further adapted to cater for the
levelofimpairmentinfamiliarityatbaseline,eitherbypre-trainingtoimprovefamiliarity,

so that RLT can be more precisely targeted to the heterogeneous clinical presentations
seen in aMCI.
