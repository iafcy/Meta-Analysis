Abstract
Background: memory training is a potential intervention for retaining memory and reducing dementia risk in older adults
withmildcognitiveimpairment(MCI).
Objective:thisstudyexaminedtheeffectofvirtualinteractiveworkingmemorytraining(VIMT)inolderadultswithMCI.
Design:single-blind,two-armparallel-group,randomisedcontrolleddesign.
Setting:retirementhomes,institutions,andcommunities.
Subjects:atotalof66olderadultswithMCIwererecruited(meanage: 78.5±7.6years).
Methods: participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (VIMT, n = 33) or active control group (n = 33).
The VIMT program used the CogniPlus (includes four training modules). Both groups attended 45min sessions 3 times
perweek,atotalof36sessions.The primaryoutcomewasworkingmemory;secondaryoutcomeswereimmediatememory,
delayed memory, subjectivememory complaints and global cognitivefunction.All variables were measuredatpre-test,post-
test,and3-monthfollow-up.
Results: between group, the effect of working memory adjusted mean difference by 1.75 (95% CI: 0.56 to 2.94; P < 0.01)
at post-test. The results were analysed by a generalised estimating equation, which indicated that VIMT group significantly

Conclusions: the applied VIMT program can enable older adults with MCI to maintain their working memory and reduce
