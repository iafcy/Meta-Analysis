Methods: This is a single-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial. Stroke patients with mild training; computer-based
cognitive impairment (n = 56) were randomly assigned to aerobic exercise training (n = 18), cognitive training; sequential
computerized cognitive training (n = 18), and the sequential combination of aerobic exercise and training; stroke
computerized cognitive training (n = 20) group. All groups underwent training 60 min/day, 3 days/
week, for a total of 12 weeks. The primary outcomes included Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(MoCA), Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition, and the Stroop color-word test. Secondary outcomes
were the Timed Up and Go test, 6-Minute Walk Test, Functional Independence Measure, Lawton
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, Community Integration Questionnaire, and Stroke
Impact Scale.
Results: 56 participants completed the trial. Compared with a single type of aerobic exercise or
cognitive training, the combined training group showed significant improvement in MoCA (P < .05,
η2 = 0.13), and two sub-tests in WMS-III (both P’s < 0.05) following the intervention. However, no
between-group differences were observed for physical functions, daily function, quality of life, and
social participation measures.
Conclusions: The findings provide evidence for the potential synergistic intervention in stroke
survivors. Future studies investigating the transfer effects and the optimal training parameters with
a larger sample is needed.
