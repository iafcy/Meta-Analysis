Abstract Introduction: Evidencefortheefficacyofcognitivetraininginpatientswithsubcorticalvascular
cognitiveimpairmentnodementiaisstilllacking.
Methods: A randomized, active controlled design using multidomain, adaptive, computerized
cognitivetrainingfor30minutes,5days/weekfor7weeks.Assessmentsincludedglobalcognitive
functionandexecutivefunction(primaryoutcomes)andbrainfunctionalconnectivityandstructural
changes(secondaryoutcomes).
Results: SixtypatientswererandomizedacrossthreemedicalcentersinBeijing.Attheendofthe
intervention, the cognitive training group showed significant improvement in Montreal Cognitive
Assessment relative to the active control group (P 5.013) and significantly increased functional
connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, which
wassignificantlycorrelatedwithMontrealCognitiveAssessmentchange(P5.017).
Discussion: Computerized cognitive training significantly improved global cognitive function,
which was supported by the improved brain plasticity. Incorporation of biomarkers should be
implementedincognitivetrainingtrials.
