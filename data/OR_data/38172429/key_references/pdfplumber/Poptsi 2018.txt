Abstract
Background: Although cognitive training is effective for people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), it is not clear which
format is more effective. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of the same language programs when carried out via com-
puter, paper/pencil and orally in people with MCI. Methods: Seventy-one participants with MCI were randomly classified in 3
experimentaland2controlgroups.Theexperimentalgroupsattended48sessionsoflanguagetrainingfor6months.Thecontrol
