Empirical Research
Comparison of Two Cognitive Training Programs With
Effects on Functional Activities and Quality of Life
Magdaléna Hagovská, PhD; Oliver Dzvoník, CSc; and Zuzana Olekszyová, MD
ABSTRACT
The aim of the current study was to compare the effectiveness of two types of cognitive training in
60 older adults with mild cognitive impairment by assessing the impact on functional activities, qual-
ity of life (QOL), and various cognitive functions. The primary outcomes were functional activity level
and QOL. The secondary outcome was cognitive examination. Group assignment was random. Group A
(n = 30) underwent CogniPlus, a computer-based, cognitive training. Group B (n = 30) underwent clas-
sical group-based cognitive training. Both programs comprised two 30-minute sessions per week for
10 weeks. After training, group A had better QOL (p < 0.001, effect size [ES] = 0.69) and better attention
(increased load score, p < 0.05, ES = –0.23; errors, p < 0.001, ES = –0.47); however, there were no group
differences in functional activity level. Group A demonstrated larger improvements in QOL and atten-
tion than group B (i.e., classical cognitive training), but the transfer to functional activities was the same
between groups.

Cognitive Training Programs for Mild Cognitive Impairment
STRENGTHS, LIMITATIONS, AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
The strengths of the current
study include a relatively high
response rate (85%) and low drop
out rate. The main limitations of
the study were the small sample and
participants were only monitored for
a short period of time. The longer-
term impact of interventions on
variables was not examined. In addi-
tion, a control (i.e., no intervention)
group was not included; therefore,
the general effect of training could
not be determined. Future studies
with longer-term follow up are nec-
essary. It would be appropriate to
determine which aspects of QOL
were most affected by the comple-
tion of cognitive training using other
validated questionnaires.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
Based on the current results, the
design of cognitive training programs
should be improved and other dual-
task training needs to be developed.
Nurses can contribute to the develop-
ment and activation of new programs
with dual tasks for older adults with
cognitive deficits, as well as long-term
monitoring of the transfer of interven-
tions to concrete domains of QOL of
older adults.
CONCLUSION
CogniPlus combined with
motion elements produced greater
improvements in QOL, overall cog-
nition as assessed by total ACE
score, and attentional functioning
(higher load scores and fewer errors
on a Stroop task) than a classical
group-based cognitive training pro-
gram. However, the transfer to func-
tional activities was no better than
the group-based classical cognitive
training program.
