ABSTRACT
Cognitive rehabilitation for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s
disease is readily available to the geriatric population. Initial evidence suggests that
techniquesincorporatingmotivationalstrategiestoenhancetreatmentengagement
may provide more benefit than computerised training alone. Seventy four adults
with subclinical cognitive decline were randomly assigned to computerised
cognitivetraining(CCT),CognitiveVitalityTraining(CVT),oranActiveControlGroup
(ACG), and underwent neuropsychological evaluations at baseline and four-month
follow-up. Significant differences were found in changes in performance on the
Modified Mini Mental State Examination (mMMSE) and measures of verbal learning
and memory across treatment groups. Experimental groups showed greater
preservation of functioning on the mMMSE than the ACG group, the CVT group
performed better than the ACG group on one measure of verbal learning and both
measures of verbal memory, and the CCT group performed better than the ACG
group on one measure of verbal learning and one measure of verbal memory.
There were no significant group differences between the CVT and CCT groups on
measures of verbal learning or memory. It was concluded that computerised
cognitive training may offer the most benefit when incorporated into a therapeutic
milieu rather than administered alone, although both appear superior to more
genericformsofcognitivestimulation.

Introduction
Thedevelopmentofeffectivetreatmentsthatdelaytheonsetofdebilitatingcognitive
symptomsindementiaisimperativetopreparetheglobalhealthsystemtoaccommo-
datethegrowinginfluxofpersonswithdementia.Recentscientificevidencesuggests
that concurrent pharmacological and cognitive rehabilitation (CR) methods may have
more benefit than medication alone in preserving function in patients suffering from
the early stages of dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD; Petersen, 2004; Van
Dyck, 2004). Cognitive rehabilitation for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early
AD is a promising intervention for the geriatric population to help curb the insidious
decline in cognitive and functional performance (Cipriani, Bianchetti, & Trabucchi,
2006; Loewenstein, Aceveda, Czaja, & Duara, 2004; Rozzini et al., 2007; Talassi et al.,
2007).Althoughspecificremediationprotocolsvaryacrossmodels,mostincludecom-
puter-based, hierarchical repeated drill and practice exercises that target memory,
attention, and executive functions, aimed atenhancingcognitive function in MCI and
earlyAD.
Cognitive rehabilitation for patients with early AD may have a modest effect on
patients with neurodegenerative pathology but presents challenges for individuals
trying to adhere to these cognitive treatments (Choi & Twamley, 2013). Problems
with intervention adherence may be due to components of the primary cognitive
illness or secondary to geriatric depression, such as early memory deficits or apathy
that may contribute to difficulties adhering to the treatment protocols (Clare et al.,
2011; Devanand et al., 2004). Rehabilitation techniques that incorporate motivational
strategies to enhance treatment engagement and cognitive outcome may benefit
peoplewithMCI.Indeed,increasingapatient’smotivationtoadheretocognitivereha-
bilitation has been associated with better outcome in schizophrenia (Choi & Medalia,
2005) and pain management (Kerns & Habib, 2004). Patients motivated to participate
consistentlyinordertoachieveadequatetreatmentintensityisnecessaryforsuccessful
rehabilitationefforts.Moreover,patientswhoareintrinsicallymotivatedseemtoobtain
greatercognitiveandfunctionalbenefitsfromthetrainingitself(Choi&Medalia,2005).
One study to date has investigated the potential impact of including motivational
instructional techniques in a CR programme for older adults with AD. Choi and
Twamley(2013)randomlyassigned69patientswithmildtomoderateADonanychol-
inesterase (ChEI) regimen (e.g., galantamine, donepezil, rivastigmine) to receive either
cognitiverehabilitationcoupledwithmotivationalvariables(i.e.,CognitiveVitalityTrain-
ing; CVT) or computerised cognitive training alone (Posit Science’s BrainFitness 1.0).
Patients in the CVT group showed more preserved memory functioning compared to
the group receiving memory training alone at 6 months (p<.05). Patients and care-
givers in CVTreportedbetter quality oflife(p<.05) andless overall depressivesymp-
toms (p<.05). A stepwise regression model showed that perceptions of self-efficacy
andautonomypredictedmemoryoutcomeat6-monthfollow-up,evenafteraccount-
ingforvariancefrombaselinememoryability,overalldementiasymptoms,andmotiv-
ation(R2=.53,p=.04).
Themechanismsleadingtobetter outcome inthisstudy arestillnotentirelyclear,
but one can surmise that patients recently diagnosed with AD (and their caregivers)
experience a tremendous loss of control in their lives, and motivation therapies like
CVT can promote self-efficacy, control, and psychological well-being in individuals
who begin to lose these qualities as part of their cognitive loss. This is consistent

withempiricalevidencethatmedicaltreatmentsthatincorporatepatient-directedgoals
and offer patients more control over treatment planning provide greater therapeutic
advantages over the traditional doctor-prescribed regimen (Brodie, Inoue, & Shaw,
2008; Kerns & Habib, 2004). Giving patients the ability to contextualise interventions
as related to personal life goals while retaining some element of self-efficacy in
medicalproceduresmayenhancetreatmentadherenceandpatientmotivation.
Fewwell-controlledstudiesexistthataddresstheefficacyofcomputerisedcognitive
rehabilitation methods in MCI and AD (Cipriani et al., 2006; Loewenstein et al., 2004;
Rozzini et al., 2007; Talassi et al., 2007). Meta-analyses of such studies reveal mixed
results, with some showing little evidence that such interventions make a difference
incognition,whileothersdocumentmodestimprovementsinspecificneuropsycholo-
gical domains and functional abilities (Clare & Woods, 2008; Sitzer, Twamley, & Jeste,
2006).Maintenanceoftreatmentgainsinthecontextofaprogressiveneurodegenera-

ingeffectivecognitiveandmotivationalinterventionsforMCIthatcanbeimplemented
before individuals enter the more advanced stages of decline and receive an AD

Thisstudyfollowsupontheresultsofapilotstudy(Choi&Twamley,2013),which
showed the efficacy of CR embedded in a motivational therapeutic milieu (i.e., CVT)
compared to treatment as usual for patients with mild to moderate AD. The current

We hypothesised that individuals with subclinical cognitive decline who were

Private Offices at the Neurological Institute, and the Memory Disorders Clinic at the
New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) as well as through the Department of
GeriatricPsychiatryattheVAConnecticutHealthcareSystem.
Diagnosisofsubclinicalcognitivedeclinewasestablishedby(1)subjectiveorinfor-

All participants were assessed on baseline neuropsychological measures following
inclusion into protocol, but, prior to randomisation, all participants were re-assessed
onalloutcomemeasuresat4months.Thefollowingdomainswereassessed:
1. PremorbidintellectualfunctioningwasassessedusingtheWRAT-3(Gladsjo,Heaton,
Palmer,Taylor,&Jeste,1999;Wilkinson,1993).
2. Global cognition was assessed using the Modified Mini Mental State Examination
(mMMSE; Stern, Mayeux, Sano, Hauser, & Bush, 1987). This instrument included all
items from the standard Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein,
& McHugh, 1975), plus the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Revised Digit Span
subtest and additional attention/calculation and general knowledge, language,
andconstructionitems.
3. ExplicitverballearningandmemorywereassessedusingtheBSRT(Buschke,1973;
Strauss, Sherman, & Spreen, 2006) and the WMS-R LM I and II subtests (Wechsler,
1997).
4. Explicit visual learning and memory were assessed using the WMS-R Visual Repro-
ductions(VR)IandIIsubtests(Wechsler,1997).
5. Self-reportedmoodsymptomswereassessedusingtheBDI-II(Beck,Steer,&Brown,

Treatment phase
This randomised clinical trial used a test–re-test treatment controlled design with
recruited patients randomly assigned to one of three research arms—Computerised
Cognitive Training (CCT), Cognitive Vitality Training (CVT), or an Active Control Group
(ACG). The treatment phase sessions were provided in individual or group format,
twice per week, with each session lasting approximately 60 minutes. Total exposure

modules for geriatric treatment, was used for this study, and has demonstrated
success in various large-scale multi-centre trials to improve neuropsychological func-
tioning in older populations (Mahncke et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2009; Zelinski et al.,
2011).

have demonstrated that individuals perform better on cognitive rehabilitation tasks if
they are (1) allowed to personalise the incidental features in the training programme
(i.e., can set personal goals rather than follow clinician-set goals), (2) provided choice

group worked on the computerised games in a similar format to individuals in the
CCT and CVT groups (either at the hospital or remotely from home), and treatment
dosage and intensity were identical to the CCT and CVT groups (i.e., a total of two
hours per week). Including this group allowed for control of the effects of clinician

Data analysis
Treatment response (i.e.,preservation ofneuropsychological functioning)wasdefined
usingchangescores frombaselinetofour-month follow-uponallneuropsychological
measures utilising data for the 74 participants who completed treatment. While the
reliable change index andstandardised regression-based modelsare typically used in
clinical settings to evaluate the clinical significance of changes in neuropsychological
test scores over time (Barr, 2002), the goal of this study was to evaluate absolute
changes in performance from baseline to four-month follow-up. Thus, change scores
for this study were calculated by subtracting the baseline standard scores from the
four-month follow-up standard scores on these same measures. When possible, stan-
dard scores (adjusting for age and/or education and gender) were used for analyses
of all dependent variables, to allow for more clinically meaningful interpretation of
the results. For neuropsychological variables, better treatment response is indicated
byhigher(atorabovezero)changescores,whichindicateseitherstableperformance
or improvement after treatment, and worse treatment response is indicated by lower
(below zero) change scores, which indicates declines after treatment. For the BDI-II
change score, better treatment response is indicated by lower (at or below zero)
change scores, which indicates either stable mood symptoms or improvement after
treatment, and worse treatment response is indicated by higher (above zero)
changes scores, which indicate worsening mood symptoms after treatment. All
changescoreswereoperationalisedascontinuousvariablesthatmaybeeitherpositive
ornegative.

treatment.Similarly,ameanincreaseof1.27pointswasseenonthemMMSEfrombase-

In terms of emotional functioning, the results revealed that the three treatment
groups were significantly different on changes in overall depressive symptomatology,
i.e., BDI-II, F(2, 71)=3.50, p=.04, h2 =.09. Tukey’s HSD tests showed that the partici-
r
pants receiving CVT showed a relative decrease in mood symptoms after treatment
compared to the ACG group, who showed a relative increase in mood symptoms.
There were no significant differences between the CVT and CCT groups, or between
theCCTandACGgroups.

Discussion
This study revealed significant differences in changes in performance on the mMMSE
and measures of verbal learning and memory across the three treatment groups (i.e.,
CVT,CCT,ACG).Althoughbetween-groupcomparisonsdidnotrevealsignificantdiffer-
ences betweenthe CVT and CCT groups, the participants enrolled in CVT did demon-
strate the largest treatment gains, and these treatment gains were significantly
greater than those that were observed in the ACG group, who demonstrated subtle
declines in performance following completion of treatment. Effect sizes generally
suggest moderate to high practical significance, and on average participants in CVT
improved by approximately 6.5 T-score points on a measure of verbal learning (i.e.,
BSRT Total Recall), and by approximately 13.2 T-score points on a measure of verbal
memory (i.e., BSRT Delay Recall). The ACG group, meanwhile, demonstrated subtle
declines onmostmeasures.Additionally,themMMSEscorefortheparticipants inthe
CVT group increased by an average of 2.78 points, compared to only 1.45 points in
the CCT group; again, the ACG group declined by approximately 0.75 points in only
four months. These findings are particularly meaningful in light of the fact that none
of the treatment groups had significantly differed with respect to their performances
on these measures at baseline. Furthermore, these results are consistent with the
aimsofthisstudy,whichhypothesisedthatparticipantsintheCVTandCCTconditions
wouldhavegreatercognitivegainsthantheACGgroup;however,thehypothesisthat
CVTwouldbespecificallysuperiortoCCTwasnotsupported.
In addition to the changes in neuropsychological status, the individuals in the CVT
group showed the greatest benefit in terms of mood symptoms. On average, partici-
pants enrolled in the CVT group showed subtle reductions in their total depressive
symptomatology(i.e.,BDI-II),whilethoseenrolledineithertheCCTorACGconditions
showed relative increases in their total depressive symptomatology, with statistical
differencesagainnotedbetweenCVTandACGbutnotbetweenCVTandCCT.
Severallimitations tothis studyshouldbenoted, however,includingtherestricted
demographics of this sample (i.e., high levels of education and low representation of
racial/ethnic minorities) and a higher than expected rate of attrition (23%), which
mayhaveresultedinabiasedsamplethatmaycontainindividualswithasignificantly
different clinical course than those individuals who discontinued study participation
prior to the four-month follow-up evaluation. However, the nature of how they differ
remains ambiguous, since participants who dropped out did not differ with respect
to any of the demographic, clinical, or neuropsychological variables compared to
those who completed treatment. Also, this study did not include measures to assess
everydayfunctioning(i.e.,managingfinancesormedications),andthusthegeneralisa-
bilityofthesecognitivegainstoreal-wordperformanceisunknown.
Nonetheless, these findings are particularly significant as the global healthcare
system prepares to accommodate an influx of older adults with dementing illnesses.
It is imperative to develop effective treatments to delay the onset of the cognitive
declineassociatedwithAD.Evenatemporarydelayincognitivedeclinewillhaveasig-
nificantimpactonthehightreatmentcostsassociatedwiththedisease.Someestimates
suggestthatpreventinga2-pointdeclineontheMMSEcouldsaveafamilythousandsof
UnitedStatesdollarsannually,whilea2-pointincreaseinMMSEscorewouldsaveeven
more(Ernst,Hay,Fenn,Tinklenberg,&Yesavage,1997).

Thesefindingsaresomewhatconvergentfromtheexistingliterature,whichsuggest
thesuperiorityofCVTcomparedtoCCTinthepreservationofmemoryfunctioningfor
individualswithAD(Choi&Twamley,2013).However,theparticipantsrecruitedforthis
study were notably much less impaired on the clinical spectrum than those in the
formerstudy,whichhadmorestringentcutoffsfordefiningimpairmentandidentifying
individuals with mild-to-moderate AD. Nonetheless, considerable evidence suggests
that cognitive rehabilitation treatments, especially the more comprehensive models
that incorporate motivational techniques, are effective at improving both cognitive
skills and real-world functioning in individuals with psychiatric illness, and studies
have demonstrated that patients who are intrinsically motivated obtain even greater
cognitive and functional benefits from the training itself (Choi & Medalia, 2005).
AlthoughwedidnotfindsignificantdifferencesbetweenCVTandCCT,ourresultsdo
support the notion that comprehensive models that incorporate motivational tech-
niques may be superior to other cognitively stimulating activities, such as word
puzzles, Sudoku, and other commercially available games. What remains to be seen,
however, is whether these treatment gains are sustained over time. For this reason,

Thesefindingsareofpracticalclinicalsignificance,becausepatientswithsubclinical

ation and poor concentration (Clare et al., 2011; Devanand et al., 2004). Although our
results are mixed, rehabilitation techniques like Cognitive Vitality Training (CVT),
which stress motivational strategies to enhance treatment engagement, may still
benefit the cognitive function of people with subclinical cognitive decline. Given the
multitude of cognitive rehabilitation methods available, and particularly given the
advent of commercial software readily available for purchase (e.g., Lumosity, Posit
Science, etc.), clarifying the short-term and long-term benefits of various treatments
willbeimportanttoensurethatclientsarereceivingmaximalbenefitfromtherapy.
