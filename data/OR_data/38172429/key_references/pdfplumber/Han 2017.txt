Abstract
Background: Spaced retrieval training (SRT)is a nonpharmacological intervention for mild cognitiveimpairment
(MCI) and dementiathattrains thelearningand retention of target informationby recalling it over increasingly
long intervals. We recently developed theUbiquitous Spaced Retrieval-based Memory Advancement and
Rehabilitation Training (USMART) program as a convenient, self-administered tablet-based SRT program. We also
demonstrated theutility of USMART for improving memory in individuals with MCI through an open-label
uncontrolled trial.
Methods: This study had an open-label, single-blind, randomized, controlled, two-period crossoverdesign. Fifty
patients withMCI were randomized into USMART–usual care and usual care–USMART treatmentsequences.
USMART was completedor usual care was provided biweekly over a 4-week treatmentperiodwith a 2-week
washout period between treatment periods. Primary outcome measures included theWord List Memory Test, Word
List Recall Test (WLRT), and Word List Recognition Test. Outcomes were measuredat baseline, week 5, and week 11
byraters who were blinded to intervention type. Anintention-to-treat analysis and linear mixedmodeling were
used.
Results: Of50 randomized participants, 41 completed thestudy (18%dropout rate). The USMART group had larger
improvements inWLRT score (effect size=0.49,p=0.031) than theusual care group. There were no significant
differences inother primary or secondary measures between theUSMART and usual care groups. Moreover, no
USMART-relatedadverse events were reported.
Conclusions: The 4-week USMART modestly improved information retrieval in older people withMCI,and was well
accepted with minimal technical support.
