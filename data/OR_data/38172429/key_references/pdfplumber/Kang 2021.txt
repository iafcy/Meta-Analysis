Abstract
Background: Cognitive training can potentially prevent cognitive decline. However, the results of recent studies using
semi-immersive virtual reality (VR)-assisted cognitive training are inconsistent.
Objective: We aimed to examine the hypothesis that cognitive training using fully immersive VR, which may facilitate
visuospatial processes, could improve visuospatial functioning, comprehensive neuropsychological functioning, psychiatric
symptoms, and functional connectivity in the visual brain network in predementia.
Methods: Participants over 60 years old with subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment from a memory clinic
were randomly allocated to the VR (n=23) or the control (n=18) group. The VR group participants received multidomain and
neuropsychologist-assisted cognitive training in a fully immersive VR environment twice a week for 1 month. The control group
participants did not undergo any additional intervention except for their usual therapy such as pharmacotherapy. Participants of
both groups were evaluated for cognitive function using face-to-face comprehensive neuropsychological tests, including the
Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT) copy task; for psychiatric symptoms such as depression, apathy, affect, and quality
of life; as well as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) at baseline and after training. Repeated-measures
analysis of variance was used to compare the effect of cognitive training between groups. Seed-to-voxel–based analyses were
used to identify the cognitive improvement–related functional connectivity in the visual network of the brain.
Results: After VR cognitive training, significant improvement was found in the total score (F =14.69, P=.001) and basic

Conclusions: Fully immersive VR cognitive training had positive effects on the visuospatial function, apathy, affect, quality
of life, and increased frontal-occipital functional connectivity in older people in a predementia state. Future trials using VR
cognitive training with larger sample sizes and more sophisticated designs over a longer duration may reveal greater improvements
in cognition, psychiatric symptoms, and brain functional connectivity.
