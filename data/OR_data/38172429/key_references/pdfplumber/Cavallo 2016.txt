Introduction
Several neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and dementias are
typically characterized by important deficits that reduce significantly patients’ skills and their overall quality of life (Cavallo,
Enrici & Adenzato, 2011; Enrici et al., 2015; Ostacoli et al., 2013). Amongst them, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most
common form of dementia, and it accounts for an estimated 60%–80% of all cases. AD affects the patient, their family and
their wider social network through its deep effects at cognitive, behavioural and social levels (Cheston & Bender, 1999;
Douradoetal.,2014).Clinicalmanifestation ofADtypicallyincludessignificantneuropsychologicaldeficitssuchasmemory
problems, frequently associated to other cognitive deficits such as aphasia, apraxia and/or agnosia, that significantly interfere
witheverydaylife(McKhannetal.,1984,2011).

In recent years, cognitive training in ADhasstarted to show its potentialities. The rationale for cognitive training in ADis
based on evidence regarding the neuropsychology and neuroanatomy of memory impairments in AD and the capacity of the
patientswithADtoacquirenewknowledge(Cavalloetal.,2013a;Cavallo,Zanalda,Johnston,Bonansea&Angilletta,2016;
Clare, Wilson, Carter, Hodges & Adams, 2001). It is relevant to note that converging evidence clearly indicates that some
cognitive subsystems (e.g., procedural memory) remain relatively intact, whilst others (e.g., episodic memory) are dramati-
cally impaired (Pause et al., 2013; Salmon & Bondi, 2009). These dissociations are indeed supported also by a developing
understandingoftherole playedbydifferent brain areas inthe cognitive processesof memory encoding, storing andretrieval
(Glisky,1998;Graham&Hodges,1997;Nadel&Moscovitch,1997).
Very recently, computerized cognitive training has started to show interesting evidence in this clinical domain. In one of
the first studies on this topic, Gaitán and colleagues (2013) investigated the effect of a computer-based cognitive training
(CBCT) program, adjunctive to traditional cognitive training (TCT) based on pen-and-paper exercises. Patients in the com-
bined treatment group (CBCT + TCT) showed less anxiety symptoms and less disadvantageous choices in decision making
than the TCT group at 12 months. The authors noted that no significant improvement or worsening was observed in memory
oremotionaltests,whereaspositiveeffectsizesfavoringtheCBCT+TCTgroupwereobservedinallvariables.
Inanotherstudy,Lee,Yip,YuandMan(2013)investigatedtheeffectsofacomputerizederrorlesslearning-basedmemory
training program (CELP) for persons with early AD, and compared its outcomes with those of a therapist-led errorless learn-
ing program (TELP) group and a waiting-list control group. Small groups were assigned to the CELP (n = 6), TELP (n = 6)
and waiting-list control (n = 7) groups. Evaluation of patients’ status before and after testing, and at 3-month follow-up was
achievedusingvarious neuropsychologicalandfunctionaltests,such asthe Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination, Chinese
DementiaRatingScale,HongKongListLearningTest,andtheBriefAssessmentofProspectiveMemory-ShortFormascog-
nitive measures, and the Modified Barthel Index, Hong Kong Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale and
Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form as functional measures. Interestingly, the authors noted that positive treatment effects
on cognition were found in both errorless learning-based memory groups (i.e., computer-assisted and therapist-led) and at a
functionallevelinpatientsreceivingTELP.However,thesmallgroupsizewasasignificantlimitofthisstudy.
More recently, a systematic review of the literature (Coyle, Traynor & Solowij, 2015) focused on computerized cognitive
training(CCT)andvirtualrealitycognitivetraining(VRCT)forindividualsathighriskofcognitivedecline.Thestudieseval-
uated (N = 16) were categorized as CCT (N = 10), VRCT (N = 3) and multimodal interventions (N = 3). The authors con-
cluded that CCT and VRCT were moderately effective in long-term improvement of cognition. As general limitations of the
studies included in this review, was underlined the need to improve study design by including larger samples, to apply longi-
tudinaldesigns,andtoassessthewidereffectofcognitivetrainingoncognitivedecline.
Totryandovercometheselimitations, inthepresentstudywerecruitedalargegroupofearly-stageADpatients(N=80),
performed a detailed neuropsychologicalassessment,andthen randomlyassigned them totwo groups: anexperimentalgroup
(N =40),undergoinga computerizedstructured cognitive training usingthe rehabilitationsoftware Brainer1, which had been
fruitfully used in an our previous study (Cavallo et al., 2013b) and included memory, attention, executive function, and lan-
guage tasks of increasing difficulty and tailored on patient’s performance; and a control group (N = 40), undergoing a com-
puterized general cognitive intervention encompassing different exercises (such as reading online newspaper articles and
discussing themwiththeneuropsychologists, navigatingweb-sitesofinterest,andsoon).Inbothgroupsthemediumwasthe
same (computer) to allow a strict comparability of interventions; however, in one case, the training was structured and ori-
ented towards rehabilitation purposes (experimental group), whereas in the other the intervention was non-specific and
unstructured (control group). Our 2-fold aim was to identify the effects of the computerized structured cognitive training in
the experimental group as compared to controls at a neuropsychological level, and to investigate whether its effects were sta-
bleafter6months.
Methods
Participants
The present study involved 80 patients with early-stage AD They were consecutively recruited over three years (from
January 2012 until October 2014) in the Assisted Health Residence “Ville Roddolo” (Moncalieri, Italy). Exclusion criteria
were the additional presence of other neurological and/or psychiatric disorders such as traumatic brain injury, stroke or psy-
chosis; a positive history of alcohol or drug abuse; the presence of any significant general health co-morbidities that could
influencepatients’cognitiveprofile(e.g.,diabetesorhypertension);andthepresenceofsignificantsensorialimpairmentsand/
or extremely severe communication problems that could seriously compromise both the administration of cognitive tests and

the interpretation of the relative results, and the implementation of the computerized cognitive training. All patients were
referred for progressing memory problems, which often resulted in embarrassing (e.g., they tended to forget names of mem-
bers of the family, or very basic information about their recent past) or dangerous (e.g., they forgot to shut off the gas a few
timesaftercooking,andtheytendedtoforgetwherethecarhadbeenparked)behaviours.Beforethebeginningofthepresent
study,acomprehensiveclinicalassessment, includingneurologicalexamination, neuropsychologicalassessmentandconsecu-
tivebrainMRIscans,wasarrangedbyConsultantNeurologists,whomadeadiagnosisofearly-stageprobableAD,according
to standard NINCDS-ADRDA diagnostic criteria (McKhann et al., 1984, 2011) and after the exclusion of possible neuropsy-
chiatricconfounders.Afterthediagnosisandpriortothebeginningofthepresentstudy,mostofthemcommencedpharmaco-
therapy with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, if tolerated. Patients were then randomized in two separate groups (experimental
and control groups) by means of a random number generator with mixed block sizes (the block size could be two, four or
eight).Therewasnosignificantdifferencesinusage,aswellastypeanddosageofinhibitorsbetweenthetwogroups.
The study was granted approval by the local Research Ethics Committee. Informed written consent was obtained from all
patientsandfromtheircaregivers.
NeuropsychologicalAssessment
All participants underwent detailed neuropsychological assessments by experienced neuropsychologists before training,
aftertrainingandafter6months,inordertoobtaindetailedinformationabouttheirperformanceacrossawiderangeofcogni-
tive domains. Neuropsychologists were blind to the purposes of the study, and to the group each patient belonged to. More
precisely, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE, Folstein, Folstein & McHugh, 1975) and the Short Intelligence Test
(Test di Intelligenza Breve, T.I.B., Colombo, Sartori & Brivio, 2002) were administered, as screening measures for cognitive
impairment and pre-morbid intelligence, respectively. Memory was assessed by administering digit span forwards and back-
wards (Wechsler, 1987), the two-syllable words repetition test (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) and the Rivermead Behavioural
Memory Test (RBMT, Wilson, Cockburn & Baddeley, 1985). Semantic knowledge was assessed by the Graded Naming test
(McKenna & Warrington, 1983). Language was assessed by the Token test (De Renzi & Vignolo, 1962). Visuospatial abili-
ties were assessed using three subtests of the Visual Object and Space Perception Battery (VOSP) (Warrington & James,
1991): object decision, position discrimination, and number location. Executive tasks included both timed and untimed tests.
Timed tests encompassed letter (F, A, S) and category (animals) spokenverbal fluency tasks (Novelli et al., 1986), as well as
the Hayling Sentence Completion test (Burgess & Shallice, 1997). As an untimed executive test, participants were adminis-
teredtheBrixtontest(Burgess&Shallice,1997).
NeuropsychiatricAssessment
Emotional disturbances were investigated by administering the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, Zigmond
&Snaith,1983),abriefself-assessmentscalethatprovidesavalidandreliablemeasureofseverityofanxietyanddepression.
Asfor neuropsychologicalmeasures,also theHADS wasadministeredthree times to eachpatient: beforetraining, after train-
ingandafter6months.
ComputerizedCognitiveTraining(ExperimentalGroup)
Each patient received an individual computerized cognitive training (three 30-min sessions per week, for 12 consecutive
weeks).Eachsessionwasperformedbythepatienttogetherwithaneuropsychologist,aswewantedtoconductthetrainingin
an interpersonal context instead of delegating completely the training to the patient in isolation. This frequency of sessions
had been chosen as previous research demonstrated that the intensity and frequency of training are the crucial issues in plan-
ning effective rehabilitation programs: in fact, frequent 30–45min sessions appear to be necessary to efficiently drive neuro-
plastic changes (Jensen, Marstrand & Nielsen, 2005). The cognitive intervention used the rehabilitative software Brainer1
(https://www.brainer.it/),thatallowsthepersontogothroughexercisestappingdifferentcognitivefunctionsandofincreasing
difficulty as long as the person’s performance improves. The software Brainer1 has been specifically designed by an expert
panel of Italian neuropsychologists, neurologists and speech therapists for rehabilitation purposes of neurological patients.
Thus, it was designed with the goal of developing a training program and a complex intellectual stimulation system targeting
patients in need of cognitive rehabilitation, and it has been fruitfully used in our previous study (Cavallo et al., 2013b).
Before the beginning of the computerized training, an individual session with each patient was planned, to show them the
software andto teachthem howtouseit.Brainer iscomposedbyasetof morethan 100exercises coveringseveral cognitive

domains: visual perception, auditory perception, attention, language, reading and writing, calculations, logic and deduction,
memory, sensory motor skills. Before the beginning of the study, exercises tapping the cognitive domains typically impaired
in early-stage AD (i.e., memory, attention, executive function and language) were selected, and two parallel versions of the
training (versions 1 and 2) were created. Half of the patients started the training with version 1; after 6 weeks, version 2 was
proposed to patients for the remaining 6 weeks, in order to avoid the repetition of the same pattern of exercises throughout
the whole training and minimizing the mere repetition of the same exercises. The remaining patients started with version 2,
and switched to version 1 after 6 weeks of training, for the reasons just mentioned. Each session included one exercise per
cognitivedomain(memory,attention,executivefunctionandlanguage),inrandomorder.
ControlCognitiveIntervention(ControlGroup)
Patients in the control group followed the same frequency of sessions (three 30-min session per week, for 12 weeks)
together with a neuropsychologist. During the sessions, a computer connected to the Internet was used and the patient was
free to choose to read electronic newspaper articles and discuss them with the neuropsychologist, or to play games and solve
puzzles, and/or reachsites andcontents of interest for him/her. The idea was to maintain the same setting as for the treatment
condition (using a computer in the presence of a neuropsychologist), but without proposing a structured cognitive training
specificallydesignedhavingrehabilitationpurposesinmind.

tests indicated normal distributions, parametric tests were used. Firstly, comparisons of the patients’ scores on background
neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric measures were performed by means of t-tests for independent samples. Then, in
order to investigate the effect of training on neuropsychological performance, a Repeated Measures General Linear Model
(RM-GLM) was run by considering participants’ performance on each test at the three assessment points (i.e., T , T and T )

as the within-subjects variable, and “group” (i.e., patients and controls) as the between-subjects factor. Lastly, single-case

As a typical issue in follow-up studies, not all participants were available at the scheduled follow-up. However, it is rele-
vant to notethatonlytwoADpatientsper group weremissingat the6-month assessment, as theirfamilies preferred to move
them from our Health Assisted Residence to another one closer to their places. As a result, 38 out of 40 patients for both
group were available at follow-up, allowing us to assess the vast majority of treated patients also 6 months from the end of
theexperimentalandcontrolinterventions.
6-MonthFollow-upNeuropsychologicalAssessment
The two groups of participants underwent for the last time the detailed neuropsychological assessment 6 months after the
end of the cognitive interventions. During this time frame, all of the patients were involved in the daily standard activities of
the Health Assisted Residence, with no specific focus on cognitive stimulation. Interestingly, the pattern of significant differ-

Lastly, to investigate the possible longitudinal effect of treatment on neuropsychological measures, a Repeated Measures
General Linear Model (RM-GLM) was run by considering participants’ performance on each test at the three assessment
points (before training, after training and at the 6-month follow-up) as the within-subjects variable, and “group” (i.e., experi-
mental versus control groups) as the between-subjects factor. p-Values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the
false-discovery rate approach. There was a statistically significant interaction between time and group on patients’ perfor-
mance on the following tests: digit span forward (F = 2.785, p = 0.03, d = 0.42), digit span backward (F = 3.183,

In order to investigate neuropsychological individual changes in the treatment group versus controls’ scores, single-case
analyseswereperformedusingtheprocedureformalizedbyCrawfordandGarthwaite(2002)todealwithsinglecasesincog-
nitive neuropsychology appropriately. More precisely, modified t-tests were used to determine whether each individual’s per-
formanceatfollow-upwassignificantlybetterthanthecorrespondingcontrolgroup’sscoresforthesevencognitivetasksthat
weresignificantlyinfluencedbythecomputerizedtraining.Thisisconsideredaveryconservativeapproach,andaimsatmak-
ing it more difficult (and then more reliable) to reject the null hypothesis of absence of differences between a single patient
and a control group. Interestingly, the vast majority of patients belonging to the experimental group got better test scores at
follow-up, as compared to control group. More precisely, for each neuropsychological tests of interest the number of patients
showing a better performance at follow-up was: for digit span forward, 30/38; for digit span backward, 32/38; for two-
syllable words test, 32/38; for RBMT story immediate, 30/38; for RBMT story delayed,32/38; for Token test, 33/38; and for
Brixtontest,35/38.

In the present randomized, clinical study we recruited a large group of early-stage AD patients (N = 80), performed a
detailed neuropsychological assessment, and then randomly assigned them to two groups: an experimental group (N = 40)
undergoingacomputerizedstructuredcognitiveinterventiontailoredonthemostvulnerablecognitivefunctionstoearly-stage
AD, and a control group (N = 40) undergoing a computerized general cognitive intervention not specifically tailored on pa-
tients’ cognitive needs. In order to maintain the two interventions as comparable as possible, it is important to note that in
both of them the medium was the same (computer). However, in one case, the training was structured and oriented towards
rehabilitation purposes (experimental group), whereas in the other the intervention was non-specific and unstructured (control
group). Our 2-fold aim was to identify the effects of the computerizedstructured cognitive training in the experimental group
ascomparedtocontrols,andtoinvestigatewhetheritseffectswerestableafter6months.Afterrandomization,thetwogroups
ofpatientswerewell-matchedintermsofage,gender,pre-morbidIQ,andlevelofformaleducation.Inaddition,thecompari-
sonof patients’performanceonthe neuropsychologicalmeasures administered showedthe presence of significant differences
between the two groups only on few neuropsychological measures (with patients in the experimental group getting lower
scores than controls), corroborating also from a neuropsychological standpoint that patients were at the early stages of their
condition and that there were no substantive differences between groups. Thus, we were confident that the patients were not
too cognitively compromised to be involved in this type of cognitive training, and that there was not a significant difference

atric factors, we investigated the presence of possible differences between groups in terms of levels of anxiety and depressive

The strength of the software Brainer1 is that it allows one to select a battery of exercises that tap specific cognitive func-
tions.Beforethebeginningofthestudy,variousexercisesofincreasingdifficultyandtappingthecognitivedomainstypically

of training were defined. In doing so, we were able to schedule a structured cognitive training specifically oriented towards
patients’ needs, and we could administer different sets of exercise during the course of the 12-week cognitive intervention.
Conversely, patients in the control group underwent a computerized general cognitive intervention encompassing different
exercises such as reading online newspaper articles and discussing them with the neuropsychologist, navigating web-sites of
interest, watching videos and listening to music: these cognitive activities were comparable in terms of time and frequency to
thestructuredintervention,butwerenotdrivenandtailoredonpatients’neuropsychologicalprofile.

repetition test, RBMT-story immediate, RBMT-story delayed,Token test and Brixton test were performed significantly better
by patients in the experimental group than controls. Interestingly, this pattern of results was maintained at the 6-month fol-
low-up. To corroborate this evidence, we showed a significant longitudinal effect in patients’ performance, compared to con-
trols, providing strong evidence of the stability over a long period of time (at least 6 months) of the results achieved

immediately after the training. For most of these tests (i.e., two-syllable words repetition test, RBMT-story immediate,
RBMT-story delayed, Token test, and Brixton test) controls’ performance over time decreased, whereas trained patients’ per-
formance improved after the training: this is both scientifically and clinically very important, as these results suggest that the
structured cognitive training realized would not only be useful in contrasting the decay in these neuropsychological abilities
dueto the clinical condition, but itwould also allowpatients toimprovetheirperformanceonsome neuropsychologicaltests,
at least within the time interval considered here. However, further studies should address specifically this important issue. In
addition, using single-case analysis we were able to demonstrate that these significant differences between trained patients
and controls depended on the vast majority of them, and not just on the mere presence of few patients influencing groups’
comparison.
Previous studies have already highlighted that specific neuropsychological domains, such as episodic memory, executive
function, language and attention, are particularly vulnerable to AD (Bondi et al., 2008), and that some of these domains can
be positively affected by cognitive intervention (Cavallo et al., 2013a; Huntley, Gould, Liu, Smith & Howard, 2015), even if
todateevidenceinthisdirectionisstillgrowing.Tothebestofourknowledge,ourstudyisoneofthefirstshowingatalarge
scaleaclearandstablepatternofimprovedneuropsychologicalperformancesinADpatientsduetothecognitivetrainingim-
plemented.Wewereabletodemonstratestabletrainingeffectsnotonlyatagrouplevel,butatanindividualleveltoo.Ourre-
sults suggest that an intense and structured cognitive training tailored on patients’ cognitive needs can lead to a significant
improvement of performance in at least some neuropsychological tests, and above all, that these achievements can be main-
tainedforatleast6monthsaftertheendofthetraining.
There are several strengths of this study. Firstly, a very detailed neuropsychological assessment was conducted at the
beginning of the study, at the end of the cognitive interventions, and at the 6-month follow-up. Although various studies
included shorter neuropsychological batteries, we were confident that our assessment was able to show strengths and weak-
nesses of patients’ neuropsychological profile. Secondly, we were able to recruit and treat a large number of patients
(N = 80), overcoming a frequent limitation of previous studies that actually involved smaller samples of participants. Lastly,
the follow-up allowedus to investigate the stability of the results achieved during the trainingafter 6 months: the vast major-
ity of participants were available at follow-up (76/80, i.e., 95%), and we were happy to see that patients belonging to the
experimental group were able to maintain an improved performance on some neuropsychological tests after such a long
periodoftime.
This study also has some limitations. Firstly, we were able to demonstrate that patients’ performance on neuropsychologi-
caltestsimprovedandwasmaintainedovertime,butwedidnotinvestigateapossibleimprovementinpatients’everydaylife
skills. In addition, it would have been interesting to know whether these acquired skills could be maintained over a longer
periodoftime(e.g.,1or2years).
In conclusion, in the present study we were able to provide to patients a structured cognitive training that lead to a stable
