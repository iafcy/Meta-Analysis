ABSTRACT
Background: To date, there is a controversy on effects of cognitive intervention to maintain or improve
hippocampal function for older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Objective: Themainobjectiveofthisstudywastoexameffectsofvirtualreality-basedspatialcognitivetraining
(VR-SCT) using VR on hippocampal function of older adults with MCI.
Method: Fifty-sixolderadultswithMCIwererandomlyallocatedtotheexperimentalgroup(EG)thatreceived
theVR-SCTorthewaitlistcontrolgroup(CG)foratotalof24sessions.ToinvestigateeffectsoftheVR-SCT
onspatialcognitionandepisodicmemory,theWeschslerAdultIntelligenceScale-RevisedBlockDesignTest
(WAIS-BDT) and the Seoul Verbal Learning Test (SVLT) were used.
Results: Duringthesessions,thetrainingperformancesgraduallyincreased(p<.001).Aftertheintervention,
the EG showed significant greater improvements in the WAIS-BDT (p < .001, η2 = .667) and recall of the
SVLT (p < .05, η2 =.094) compared to the CG but in recognition of the SVLT (p > .05, η2 =.001).
Conclusion: TheseresultssuggestthattheVR-SCTmightbeclinicallybeneficialtoenhancespatialcognition
and episodic memory of older adults with MCI.

Discussion
Inthisstudy,olderadultswithMCIwhounderwent
VR-SCT showed significant improvements in both
spatialcognitionandepisodicmemory.Asexpected,
VR-SCTmightbeusefulforimprovinghippocampal
functionofolderadultswithMCI,inlinewithresults
of previous studies (Savulich et al., 2017; Meade
et al., 2019).
Active navigation has a clinical usefulness in
improvingspatial cognition ofolderadultswithMCI
comparedtopassivenavigation(Howettetal.,2019).
Accordingly,inthisstudy,VR-SCTwasimplemented
through active navigation rather than passive navi-
gation to maximize its effects. Results of this study
confirmedthatspatialcognitionwasincreasedafter
the 8-week intervention, suggesting that VR-SCT
might be helpful in improving the hippocampal
functionofolderadultswithMCI.Spatialcognition
thatmainlyreliesonhippocampalfunctioncouldbe
enhancedfollowingnavigationexperiences(Meade
et al., 2019), consistent with results of this study.
Indeed, a previous study has reported that hippo-
campal volumes of London taxi drivers are larger
thanthoseofcontrols,indicatingthatthehippocam-
pal function might be due to experience-dependent
changes (Maguire et al., 2006). In addition, several
neuroimaging studies showed that increases of gray
matterinrightposteriorhippocampuswereobserved
in individuals who performed spatial tasks (Boyke
et al., 2008, Laczó et al., 2017).
Specifically, allocentric navigation strategy was
adopted to perform VR-SCT in the present study.
Allocentric navigation strategy requires visualizing
cognitive map using object-to-object relationship
fromanenvironment-centeredviewpoint(Colombo
et al., 2017). Previous neuroimaging studies have
indicated that allocentric strategy is correlated with
hippocampalfunction,suggestingthatVR-SCTwith
allocentricnavigationstrategyratherthanegocentric
navigation strategy should be implemented in order
toenhancehippocampalfunction(Iariaetal.,2007).
Additionally, in the present study, since no local
landmarkinformationwaspresented,theEGgroup
was focused on processing allocentric boundary
information. A previous study has indicated that
when older adults search for a certain goal location
withlandmarkcues,activationinstriatumratherthan
