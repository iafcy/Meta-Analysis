The results of a pilot randomised controlled trial of computerised cognitive
training in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are reported.
Participants (N = 25) were randomised into either the treatment or waitlist train-
ing groups. Sixteen participants completed the 30-session computerised cognitive
training program using exercises that target a range of cognitive functions includ-
ing attention, processing speed, visual memory and executive functions. It was
hypothesised that participants would improve with practice on the trained tasks,
that the benefits of training would generalise to nontrained neuropsychological
measures, and that training would result in improved perceptions of memory and
memory functioning when compared with waitlist controls. Results indicated that
participants were able to improve their performance across a range of tasks with
training. There was some evidence of generalisation of training to a measure of
visual sustained attention. There were no significant effects of training on self-
reported everyday memory functioning or mood. The results are discussed along
with suggestions for future research.
