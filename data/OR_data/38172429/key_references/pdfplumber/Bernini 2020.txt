Abstract
Background The effectiveness of computer-based cognitive training (CCT) remains controversial, especially in older adults
with neurodegenerative diseases.
Aims To evaluate the efficacy of CCT in patients with Parkinson’s disease and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI).
Methods In this randomized controlled trial, 53 patients were randomized to receive CCT delivered by means of CoRe
software, traditional paper-and-pencil cognitive training (PCT), or an unstructured activity intervention (CG). In each group,
the intervention lasted 3 consecutive weeks (4 individual face-to-face sessions/week). Neuropsychological assessment was
administered at baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1). Outcome measures at T0 and T1 were compared within and between
groups. The Montreal Overall Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was taken as the primary outcome measure.
Results Unlike the PCT group and the CG, the patients receiving CCT showed significant medium/large effect size improve-
ments in MoCA performance, global cognition, executive functions, and attention/processing speed. No baseline individual/
demographic variables were associated with greater gains from the intervention, although a negative correlation with baseline
MoCA performance was found.
Conclusion CCT proved effective in PD-MCI patients when compared with traditional PCT. Further follow-up assess-
ments are being conducted to verify the retention of the gains and the potential ability of the tool to delay conversion to
PD-dementia.
