Keywords: Introduction: Cognitive training (CT) has been proposed as a treatment option for cognitive impairment in Par-
Parkinson’s disease kinson’s disease (PD). We aimed to assess the efficacy of adaptive, computerized CT on cognitive function in PD.
Cognitive training Methods: In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial we enrolled PD patients that experienced substantial

psychological outcomes and subjective cognitive complaints. Outcomes were assessed before and after training
and at six-months follow-up, and analyzed with multivariate mixed-model analyses.
Results: The intention-to-treat population consisted of 136 participants (n =68 vs. n =68, age M: 62.9y, female:
39.7%). Multivariate mixed-model analyses showed no group difference on the Tower of London accuracy

(cid:0) 0.55 to (cid:0) 0.06, p =0.015. CT did not reduce subjective cognitive complaints. At follow-up, no group differences
were found.
Conclusions: This study shows no beneficial effect of eight-week computerized CT on the primary outcome (i.e.,
planning accuracy) and only minor improvements on secondary outcomes (i.e., processing speed) with limited
clinical impact. Personalized or ecologically valid multi-modal intervention methods could be considered to
achieve clinically meaningful and lasting effects.
