Abstract Introduction: Evidence for the efficacy of cognitive training in patients with subcortical vascular
cognitive impairment no dementia is still lacking.
Methods: A randomized, active controlled design using multidomain, adaptive, computerized
cognitive training for 30 minutes, 5 days/week for 7 weeks. Assessments included global cognitive
function and executive function (primary outcomes) and brain functional connectivity and structural
changes (secondary outcomes).
Results: Sixty patients were randomized across three medical centers in Beijing. At the end of the
intervention, the cognitive training group showed significant improvement in Montreal Cognitive
Assessment relative to the active control group (P 5 .013) and significantly increased functional
connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, which
was significantly correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment change (P 5 .017).
Discussion: Computerized cognitive training significantly improved global cognitive function,
which was supported by the improved brain plasticity. Incorporation of biomarkers should be
implemented in cognitive training trials.

1. Introduction

Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is one of the most
common causes of acquired cognitive impairment, second
only to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [1]. Vascular cognitive
impairment no dementia (VCIND) refers to cognitive
deficits associated with underlying vascular causes that are
insufficient to confirm a diagnosis of dementia. According
to the China Cognition and Aging Study, VCIND accounts
for 42.0% of cases of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in
China, rendering it the most common subtype of MCI
therein [2]. A 5-year follow-up of patients with VCIND
revealed that 50.0% of the patients developed dementia,
including AD [3].
Although VCIND is potentially a key stage at which early
intervention may delay or prevent dementia, an approved
method of intervention has yet to be developed. Recent
advances in cognitive training, however, may inform
strategies to treat VCIND. In a healthy elderly population,
the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital
Elderly trial led to improvement in targeted domains and
daily function, which was maintained across long-term
follow-up [4]. In addition, computerized cognitive training
has demonstrated potential as an effective intervention for
patients with MCI or early AD [5]. Despite the promise of
such findings, far fewer resources have been allocated to
nonpharmacological approaches to treating dementia,
including cognitive training, than to the development of
pharmacological disease-modifying therapies [6]. Evidence
for the efficacy of cognitive training in patients with VCIND
is consequently lacking. Considering the significant
heterogeneity of VCIND, research must address the dearth
of data on the efficacy of intervention trials with respect to
VCIND subtypes.
The present study focused on the most common subtype
of the disorder, VCIND caused by subcortical ischemic
small vessel disease (subcortical VCIND), as its relatively
homogenous features render it a suitable target condition
for intervention trials. We conducted a randomized, active
controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a 7-week
multidomain, adaptive, computerized cognitive training
regimen in patients with subcortical VCIND (the
Cog-VACCINE study). As executive dysfunction is the
primary impairment associated with subcortical VCIND

[7], we used the Trail Making Test (TMT) in tandem with
assessing global cognitive function via the Montreal
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as an additional primary
outcome to confirm whether cognitive training could
attenuate executive dysfunction in patients with subcortical
VCIND. Observed alleviation of cognitive dysfunction
would likely be accounted for by changes to brain plasticity

[8], including increased gray matter volume, improved white
matter integrity, and changes in neuronal functional
connectivity. To assess these secondary outcomes and
elucidate the mechanism underlying a possible effect of
i i i i f d l i


resonance imaging (sMRI) and functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI).

2. Methods

2.1. Study design and registrations

The present randomized, active controlled clinical trial
was conducted in accordance with both the CONSORT
statement and the CONSORT statement for nonpharmacological interventions. Participants with subcortical VCIND
were recruited from three centers: Xuanwu Hospital;
Beijing Friendship Hospital; and Fu Xing Hospital, Capital
Medical University. All participants provided written
informed consent. Ethical approval was obtained from the
Ethics Committee of Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical
University (2015010). The trial was registered under
[ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02640716) and its protocol has](http://ClinicalTrials.gov)
been published previously [9].

2.2. Participants

The diagnosis of VCIND was based on evidence of both
cognitive impairment without dementia and small vessel
ischemic disease. All patients were diagnosed by a
consensus panel including three senior neurologists and
met the following inclusion criteria: (1) literate in Han
Chinese with a consistent caregiver (.4 days/week);
(2) complaint and/or informant report of cognitive
impairment involving memory and/or other cognitive
domains with a duration of at least 3 months; (3) according
to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fourth Edition, the patients were neither normal
nor demented as indicated by a clinical dementia rating of
0.5 on at least one domain, a global score of 0.5, and a
� �
Mini–Mental State Examination score of 20 (primary
�
school) or 24 (junior school or above); and (4) normal or
�
slightly impaired daily living activities as defined by a total
score of 1.5 for the three functional clinical dementia
�
rating domains (home and hobbies, community affairs, and
personal care). We excluded participants who exhibited
any condition that would preclude completion of
neuropsychological testing or disorders other than
subcortical VCIND that would affect cognition.
The MRI-based inclusion criteria details were as follows:
(1) multiple ( 3) supratentorial subcortical small infarcts
�
(3–20 mm in diameter) with/without white matter lesions
of any degree or moderate-to-severe white matter lesions
(score of 2 according to the Fazekas rating scale [10])
�
with/without small infarct; (2) absence of cortical or
watershed infarcts, hemorrhages, hydrocephalus, or white
matter lesions with specific causes (e.g., multiple sclerosis);
and (3) no hippocampal or entorhinal cortex atrophy (score
of zero according to the medial temporal lobe atrophy scale
of Scheltens [11]).
Exclusion criteria included the following: (1) severe
h i h f h i h l d l i f

neuropsychological assessments or MRI; (2) clinically
significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, respiratory, or
other systemic diseases; and (3) other disorders or use of
medication that might affect cognitive functions.

2.3. Blinding

The participants were randomly assigned to training or
active control group. The personnel involved in conducting
the study and data analysis were masked to the patient
randomization. Study participants, their caregiver, and all
assessors were blinded to treatment assignment throughout
the study.

2.4. Procedures

Patients in the intervention group received a
computerized, multidomain, adaptive training program for
7 weeks. The training domains included processing speed,
attention, perception, long-term memory, working memory,
calculation, executive control, reasoning, and problem
solving. The rigor with which each domain was trained
differed according to each task and informed the grouping
of the tasks. Participants were required to complete 30 min
of training per day (five 2-min tasks completed thrice),
5 days a week. Within each task, high accuracy (.80%)
was required to upgrade to the next difficulty level.
The active control group received five processing speed
and attention tasks, whose duration totaled to 30 min each
training day. However, these tasks were set to a fixed,
primary difficulty level across the study.
The training of all participants was completed at home
and supervised by an independent neurologist over the
[Internet (www.66nao.com) to guarantee the fulfillment of](http://www.66nao.com)
the training.
The intervention began directly after randomization. All
the outcomes were assessed at the baseline, end of
intervention, and 6 months after randomization to measure
long-term resilience of the effect. For the details of the
interventions, see Methods in Supplementary Materials.

2.5. Outcomes

The primary outcome measures were global cognitive
function, measured by MoCA, and executive function,
measured by TMT B-A; both were centrally assessed.
Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that
cognitive training could enhance functional and structural
connectivity and/or local morphometry. The secondary
outcomes of the present study therefore included structural
and functional indices: the gray-matter volume of the
hippocampus, a key brain structure linked with memory
impairment [12]; and white-matter (WM) integrity, which
is associated with cognitive decline [13]. Functional
connectivity was assessed in the default mode network
(DMN) and the executive control network (ECN), two


Prior research has shown that the DMN and ECN are
associated with pathological disconnection in cognitive
decline and the progression of dementia [14], and cognitive
training was found to modulate them [15].
In addition to the primary outcomes, we conducted other
neuropsychological evaluations: the Digit Span, the
WHO-UCLA Auditory Verbal Learning Test [16], the
Boston Naming Test (BNT), the Hachinski Ischemic Scale,
the Geriatric Depression Scale, the Neuropsychiatric
Inventory, and an assessment of activities of daily living.

2.6. MRI data

2.6.1. MRI data collection
The MRI data were acquired via a 3.0 T Siemens scanner.
High-resolution T1-weighted images of the whole brain
were obtained using a sagittal 3D magnetization-prepared
rapid gradient echo sequence. Resting-state fMRI was
conducted using a multiband echo-planar imaging
sequence. DTI images were acquired by using a diffusionweighted double spin-echo-planar imaging sequence. See
Supplementary Materials for sequence details.

2.6.2. Volumetric analysis of the hippocampus
Volumetric analysis was performed using FSL-integrated
[registration and segmentation toolbox (FIRST; https://fsl.](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk)
[fmrib.ox.ac.uk). Followed the FIRST processing guideline,](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk)
the volume of the bilateral hippocampus was extracted and
compared across groups via the linear mixed effect model
(see Supplementary Materials for details).

2.6.3. White matter microstructure
DTI data preprocessing was implemented using PANDA
software (a pipeline tool for analyzing brain diffusion im[ages; http://www.nitrc.org/projects/panda/) [17]. Following](http://www.nitrc.org/projects/panda/)
the processing guideline, the fractional anisotropy was
estimated and calculated. Fractional anisotropy of WM
tracts associated with cognitive decline in VCI [13,18] was
then extracted for analysis (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for
details).

2.6.4. Functional connectivity
Resting-state fMRI data were preprocessed by using the
DPARSF (a toolbox for Data Processing and Analysis of
Brain Imaging; [http://www.rfmri.org)](http://www.rfmri.org) following the
guideline (see Supplementary Materials for details) [19]. A
seed-based approach was performed first for baseline data
to identify the DMN (seed in the posterior cingulate cortex,
PCC) and ECN (seed in the left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, DLPFC.L). Based on the identified network, the
mean time courses were extracted from bilateral DLPFC,
inferior parietal lobule in the ECN, medial prefrontal cortex,
and PCC in the DMN (blue in Supplementary Fig. 2), and the
functional connectivity (Pearson’s correlation coefficients)
was calculated between each pair of regions for the baseline,


-----

Fisher’s Z transformation correlation coefficients were then
extracted for each pair in each time point and used as inputs
for the corresponding linear mixed effect models.

2.7. Statistical analyses

All data were analyzed according to intent-to-treat
principles. The effects of cognitive training on neuropsychological scores and MRI data were examined using linear
mixed effect models nested within individuals. Time was
assigned as the repeated variable. Group, time, and
group-by-time were included as fixed effects. We analyzed
the changes in the neuropsychological scores and MRI
data from the baseline to the end of intervention and from
baseline to 6-month follow-up. A statistically significant
difference (two tailed, P, .05) for any of the two primary
outcomes at the end of the intervention would be considered
as preliminary evidence of efficacy. Correlation analyses
between significant brain functional changes and
neuropsychological scores were then performed to explore
a potential neural mechanism for cognitive functional
changes.

3. Results

3.1. Participants’ characteristics

Participants were enrolled from December 22, 2015
through November 7, 2016. The last follow-up
measurements were obtained in May 8, 2017. The flow of
participants through the study is shown in Fig. 1. A total
of 212 individuals from the neurology and geriatric clinics
were included and assessed for eligibility. Of these, 152
were excluded and the present study therefore enrolled a
total of 60 patients. They were randomly assigned to the
cognitive training or active control groups. A total of 54
participants (27 in each group) finished the trial with good
compliance. A total of 44 participants (23 in the training
group and 21 in the active control group) completed the
6-month follow-up. Of the 16 participants (26.7%) who
withdrew from the study, five reported health issues, four
reported time constraints, five were dissatisfied, and two
reported personal issues. Baseline characteristics and
neuropsychological assessment data are shown in Table 1.
We found no group differences in age, sex, or duration of
education. Except for immediate recall, the neuropsychological testing scores were matched between the two groups.
All participants completed more than 90% of the training
requirement. There was no significant group difference in
both training days (P 5 .167) and training time per day
(P 5 .134) (Table 1).

the active control group (21.23 to 21.15), with an effect size
of 0.637 (95% CI 0.115–1.153) compared with the control
group. This difference did not persist at the 6-month
follow-up. We found no significant group ! time interaction
in the TMT B-A.

3.3. Secondary outcome measures

Secondary outcome measures included hippocampal GM
volume, WM integrity, and functional connectivity. There
was no significant group ! time effect for hippocampus
GM volume (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1) or WM
integrity (Supplementary Table 1).
Critically, at the end of the intervention, there was a
significant group ! time interaction for the connectivity
between the DLPFC.L and medial prefrontal cortex
(Fig. 4). Furthermore, we found a significant increase in
connectivity from the baseline to the end of the intervention
in the training group; this change was absent in the active
control group. The enhanced connectivity across the
intervention was positively correlated with MoCA changes
(r 5 0.463, P 5 .017) in the training group but not in the
active control group (r 5 0.08, P 5 .68). No significant
group ! time interaction for connectivity was found
between the other pairs or at the 6-month follow-up
(Supplementary Table 2).
For other neuropsychological tests, a significant
group ! time interaction was observed in the BNT
(Fig. 2) at the end of the intervention (effect size 5 0.560,
95% CI 0.042–1.074, P 5 .028); this finding had also
dissipated by the 6-month follow-up. No significant
group ! time interaction was observed in the activities of
daily living, Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Digit Span,
Neuropsychiatric Inventory, or Geriatric Depression Scale.

No study-related adverse events were reported in either


4. Discussion

VCIND features potential as an effective point at which
interventions may delay or even prevent dementia. The
Cog-VACCINE study is the first registered randomized
controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of computerized,
multidomain, adaptive cognitive training in patients with
subcortical VCIND. The strengths of the present study
include its active control design and use of both
neuropsychological evaluation and sMRI and fMRI as
outcomes.
Concerning primary outcomes, we found that relative to
the active control condition, cognitive training led to a
significant improvement in global cognitive function, as
measured by MoCA, but not in executive function, as
measured by TMT B-A, by the end of the 7-week
intervention. This result is consistent with findings from a
recent meta-analysis of computerized cognitive training

[5]: although computerized cognitive training affected
small-to-moderate improvements in the global cognition of
patients with mild cognitive impairment, the meta-analysis
reported a lack of efficacy on executive function. This is
further endorsed by another meta-analysis of 16 studies
that showed a small but significant effect of cognitive
training among MCI patients; however, 13 of them failed
to find a significant effect of cognitive training on executive
functions [20]. Small samples or inadequate training of
executive processes may account for the nonsignificant
results in previous studies. Although processing speed,
inhibitory control, and reasoning were included in our
multidomain training paradigm, the inclusion of more
executive tasks may have yielded stronger gains in
executive function. The limited ability of the elderly
participants, particularly those with relatively more severe
cognitive impairment, to transfer gains from trained to
untrained cognitive domains provides an alternative
explanation [21].
For secondary outcomes, we found a trend of

yet no significant group ! time interaction was found.
Similarly, in line with a recent study showing that cognitive
training in MCI induced no improvement in brain structure

[22], no training effect on WM integrity was found [23].
The cognitive training group did, however, exhibit
significant increases in functional connectivity between the
DLPFC.L and medial prefrontal cortex by the end of
intervention. Evidence from AD studies showed that the
anticorrelation between the DMN and ECN found in healthy
adults was diminished in MCI and AD patients [14]. In
agreement with the results found in the healthy elderly

[15] and AD patients [24], our results suggest that the
disconnection can be rebuilt by cognitive training [25].
Moreover, the connectivity change was significantly
correlated with MoCA change, that is, a stronger
anticorrelation connectivity was linked with larger MoCA
performance improvement in the training group but not in
the active control group. This internetwork connectivity


changes may suggest improvement in brain plasticity for
cognitive improvement. The changes in both MoCA and
functional connectivity disappeared at 6-month follow-up,
possibly on account of the training duration having been
too short to yield long-term effects on structural integrity
markers detected via sMRI. Because these are the first data
concerning VCIND collected by an explorative analysis,
this finding requires replication in an independent sample.
The number of cognitive training studies has increased
over the last few years [5]. Most of such studies have used
neuropsychological assessments as outcomes to assess the
direct clinical benefit of intervention. However,
neuropsychological evaluation does not yield insights into
concomitant underlying pathophysiological changes.
Moreover, AD studies have shown that the incorporation
of biomarkers, especially those reflecting the underlying
pathophysiological mechanism of AD progression or targets
of intervention, in clinical trials could help to reveal target

engagement and identify evidence of disease modification

[26], such as CSF Ab1–42 and amyloid PET for antiamyloid
therapeutic trials [27]. Similarly, the incorporation of
biomarkers should also be encouraged in cognitive training
clinical trials, as brain plastic changes are expected to
underlie functional gains achieved by cognitive training

[28]; the combined use of sMRI and fMRI is a potential
proxy of changes in brain plasticity [29]. Recently, clinical
trials on cognitive training effects in AD have begun to
consider the use of fMRI findings as markers to elucidate
the mechanisms underlying clinical efficacy [24]. We
therefore included sMRI and fMRI indices previously found
to be associated with cognitive decline in dementia
conversion as secondary outcomes in the present study. We
found that cognitive training increased functional
connectivity between the DMN and ECN, which was
significantly correlated with improvement in global
cognitive function. Our study therefore suggests that
fMRI indices could provide suitable biomarkers for
cognitive training studies not only in AD [30] but also in
VCIND.
In addition to MoCA and TMT B-A, we analyzed the
effect of intervention on other cognitive domains. Our
results showed that cognitive training significantly improved
language function as measured by BNT. While one
meta-analysis reported that cognitive training had a
beneficial effect on language function [20], another
meta-analysis reported null findings on language function
in patients with MCI [5]. Although these two
meta-analyses had different results for test statistics, they
had similar effect sizes for language function (Hedges’
g 5 0.511 and 0.41, respectively). The inconsistent results
are probably due to the high heterogeneity (I[2] 5 80.69%
for the null finding). However, in patients with cognitive
impairment after stroke, computerized training improved
global function as well as the BNT scores [31], which
supported the present finding.
Although cognitive training affected a significant
improvement on MoCA, BNT, and internetwork
connectivity after the 7-week intervention, the improvement disappeared by the 6-month follow-up. Regarding
the resilience of cognitive training gains, the literature is
inconsistent. One previous investigation found that
although cognitive training prevented memory decline of
MCI patients during a 6-month intervention period, this
effect had dissipated by the 18-month follow-up [32]. By
contrast, the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent
and Vital Elderly trial showed that, in cognitively normal
older adults, 10–14 weeks of cognitive training with
booster training induced significant improvements in the
trained domains that persisted up to 5–10 years [4].
Considered in the context of our findings, the maintenance
of a training effect is less likely among those with some
degree of cognitive impairment. For subcortical VCIND
patients to sustain cognitive improvements, continuous


The present study is subject to several limitations. First,
the significant attenuation of the improvements by the
6-month follow-up suggests that a longer intervention period
is needed to observe potentially sustainable benefits of
cognitive training. Second, although this study used
well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria for subcortical
VCIND, we cannot rule out the possibility of mixed
pathology, such as concomitant AD. By excluding
individuals with indications of atrophy of the hippocampus
or entorhinal cortex, we likely excluded individuals with
advanced AD pathology; however, prodromal stages with
increased amyloid load could not be excluded. Future
studies using AD biomarkers are needed to rigorously
evaluate the efficacy of cognitive training in patients
with subcortical VCIND and to test whether different
pathologies respond differentially to cognitive training.
Third, as the first registered randomized controlled trial
study to investigate the efficacy of computerized
cognitive training in subcortical VCIND, except for the
mostly used primary outcome-global cognitive function,
we also explored the training effect on the characteristic
executive dysfunction in subcortical VCIND. Therefore,
both MoCA and TMT B-A were set as primary outcomes.
In the interest of an unambiguous outcome of the study, it
would have been preferable to declare a priori that
observing a statistically significant difference in any of the
two primary outcomes would provide preliminary evidence
of efficacy.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, the computerized, multidomain, adaptive
cognitive training improved global cognitive function and
the connection between two cognition-related networks,
the DMN and ECN, in patients with subcortical VCIND.
The significant correlation between the restored connection
and improved global cognitive function suggested that
biomarkers of functional connectivity as proxy for effects
of brain plasticity should be incorporated as outcomes in
cognitive training trials. Although the efficacy and good
safety profile of cognitive training in patients with
subcortical VCIND recommend its adoption, more clinical
trials are needed for further evidence.
