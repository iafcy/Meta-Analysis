Objective: To determine the usefulness of an interactive multimedia internet-based system (IMIS) for the
cognitive stimulation of Alzheimer’s disease.
Methods: This is a 24-week, single-blind, randomised pilot study conducted on 46 mildly impaired
patients suspected of having Alzheimer’s disease receiving stable treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors
(ChEIs). The patients were divided into three groups: (1) those who received 3 weekly, 20-min sessions of
IMIS in addition to 8 h/day of an integrated psychostimulation program (IPP); (2) those who received only
IPP sessions; and (3) those who received only ChEI treatment. The primary outcome measure was the
Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog). Secondary outcome measures were: MiniMental State Examination (MMSE), Syndrom Kurztest, Boston Naming Test, Verbal Fluency, and the
Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test story recall subtest.
Results: After 12 weeks, the patients treated with both IMIS and IPP had improved outcome scores on the
ADAS-Cog and MMSE, which was maintained through 24 weeks of follow-up. The patients treated with
IPP alone had better outcome than those treated with ChEIs alone, but the effects were attenuated after
24 weeks. All patients had improved scores in all of the IMIS individual tasks, attaining higher levels of
difficulty in all cases.
Conclusion: Although both the IPP and IMIS improved cognition in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, the
IMIS program provided an improvement above and beyond that seen with IPP alone, which lasted for
24 weeks.


lzheimer’s disease is the most frequent form of
dementia in elderly people,[1 2] and its current treatment
includes cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs),[3–5] and N
# A

methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockers (eg, memantine).[6]

However, symptomatic treatment often entails non-pharmacological treatments as well, and adequate dementia management requires a wide range of intervention to help maximise
the patient’s independence, increase their self-confidence
and relieve burden to the care giver.

Current symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer’s disease can
improve cognition and functionality.[3–6] However, before the
emergence of these drugs, non-pharmacological treatments
had already been evaluated and cognitive stimulation had
been found to be potentially beneficial for patients with
dementia.[7–9] Although these non-pharmacological treatments
do not always seem efficacious, methodological problems
may limit the validity of some studies.[10] A recent Cochrane
review[11] emphasised caution when interpreting the results of
non-pharmacological treatments, but suggested that certain
cognitive domains could, in fact, benefit from these types of
interventions.

Clinical and laboratory studies have shown that mental
and physical activity can positively influence cognition in
normal elderly people and people with dementia. Education[12]

and lifestyle choices (eg, occupation and leisure activities)[13–15]

can modulate the risk of developing dementia, and psychomotor stimulation improves cognition in patients with
Alzheimer’s disease.[16 17] Environmental enrichment can
improve cognition in transgenic mice.[18 19] Despite the
continued deposition of b-amyloid, exercise can increase
the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor[20] and may
reduce amyloid burden.[21]


Despite the progressive nature of the degenerative process,
patients with Alzheimer’s disease also seem to retain the
physiological capacity to alter brain structure and function.
Recent studies have shown cognitive plasticity and learning
potential not only in patients with Alzheimer’s disease but
also in healthy elders.[22 23] Positron emission tomography
studies that used activation paradigms[24 25] have found that
people with Alzheimer’s disease have a greater activation
than those without dementia in the brain regions usually
associated with memory tasks, as well as in the frontal lobes
that were activated only with increasing difficulty of tasks.
Pathological studies conducted on biopsy specimens of
patients with Alzheimer’s disease with mild or moderate
dementia have shown increased synaptic contact size.[26] Thus,
the brain may be able to compensate during the early stages
of Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that there may be some
utility to non-pharmacological adjunctive interventions.

Although studies on cognitive stimulation show that it is
possible to stimulate the memory of patients with Alzheimer’s
disease, the results are often modest. Because of methodological limitations, there is a need to conduct more randomisedcontrolled trials with larger samples to validate this therapeutic
approach. Computerised systems[27] and internet-based distance
programs offer one potential mechanism by which nonpharmacological cognitive stimulation can be conducted in

patients with dementia. In this study, we evaluated an
interactive multimedia internet-based system (IMIS) as an
adjunct to ChEI treatment and classic psychostimulation
treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Forty six patients suspected of having Alzheimer’s disease[28]

were recruited for the study through a referral clinic and
daycare centre (Fundacio´ ACE, Institut Catala` de
Neurocie`ncies Aplicades, Barcelona, Spain). The Institut
Catala` de Neurocie`ncies Aplicades is a referral diagnostic
clinic for community-dwelling people with dementia, and
also provides adult daycare services to these patients. All of
the patients had been treated with ChEIs for at least 1 year
before inclusion to the study. The inclusion criteria were:
### N [.][65 years of age;] N [at least 3 years of education;] N [a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)][29 30][ score]

between 18 and 24;
### N [a Global Deterioration Scale (GDS)][31][ score of 3 or 4;] N [absence of uncontrolled disruptive behaviours (eg, aggres-]

sion, delusions, hallucinations and agitation) that could
interfere with program administration and/or neuropsychological assessments;
### N [absence of major depression, current or partial remission][32][;] N [absence of structural lesions in the computed tomogram or]

magnetic resonance image;
### N [absence of history of alcohol or other substance abuse; and] N [absence of severe auditory, visual or motor deficits that]

may interfere with cognitive testing.

None of the participants had previous experience with a
personal computer and all attended the daycare centre
5 days/week. Participants were allowed to be on stable doses
of psychotropic drugs.

Multimedia treatment
The IMIS was conducted using Smartbrain (http://www.
educamigos.com), an interactive multimedia tool that allows
patients to carry out a variety of different stimulation
programs, at different levels of difficulty and at various
times during the day. Briefly, the IMIS program consists of 19
separate ‘‘tasks’’ or stimulation exercises across the domains
of attention, calculation, gnosis, language, memory and
orientation. All participants began at the lowest level of
difficulty (first of 15 levels) and the program monitored
activity at each level. Difficulty increased automatically after
three consecutive performances within a single task without
error, or when a patient was 80% correct over six consecutive
sessions. A patient’s level of difficulty decreased when his or
her performance fell below 15% correct for three consecutive
sessions or,20% correct for six consecutive sessions. All
patients were trained before the study with the use of the
computer mouse, especially on how to ‘‘click and drag’’.

Integrated psychostimulation program
The IPP is a daily program in the daycare centre that includes
cognitive stimulation tasks, workshops (eg, music therapy,
art and crafts, and physical activity) and reinforcement of
instrumental activities of daily living.[17] The IPP is integrated
into the daycare centre activities, and it takes 2 h in the
morning and 1.5 h in the afternoon out of the 8 h that the
patients spend in the centre.

Each patient was randomly assigned to one of three study
groups:


### N [Experimental group: These patients received the IMIS, as]

well as the IPP and ChEIs.
### N [IPP control: These patients received IPP and ChEIs.] N [ChEIs control: These patients received only ChEIs.]

The ChEIs group comprised of patients who were
diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, but who were living at
home, and never received the IPP or the IMIS. These patients
either did not want to come to the daycare centre, although
they agree to be followed clinically, or were on a waiting list
for admission to the daycare centre. The experimental and
the IPP control groups were participants in the daycare
centre, and the only difference between these two groups was
that the experiment group received the IMIS. Written
informed consent was obtained from all the participants
enrolled in the study and their legal representative before the
study onset.

Three patients in the experimental group dropped out of
the study: one because of rapid progression of the disease and
two because of institutionalisation. Consequently, from the
initial sample of 46, 43 patients completed the study: 15 in
the experimental group, 16 in the IPP control group and 12 in
the ChEI control group (table 1).

Experimental group
These patients received the IMIS, IPP and ChEIs.

IPP control
These patients received IPP and ChEIs.

ChEI control
These patients received only ChEIs.

No significant differences were observed between the
groups in terms of age (F2,41 = 0.72) or level of education
(x[2] = 5.513, df = 4, p = 0.239). There was a tendency for a
difference in the proportion of male patients, primarily
because all the patients in the ChEI group were female;
however, the difference was not significant (x[2] = 5.70, df = 2,
p = 0.06).

Patients were assessed at study entry, and after 12 and
24 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome measure was
the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADASCog) section.[33] This is a standardised measure of cognitive
function that examines components of memory, language,
visuoconstructional and ideational praxis, and orientation.
High ADAS-Cog scores indicate worse performance. The
secondary measures were:
### N [MMSE][: This is a global measure of cognitive function that]

examines orientation to time and place, immediate and
delayed recall of three words, attention and calculation,
language and visuoconstructional functions.
### N [Syndrom Kurztest (SKT)][34][: This is a short cognitive perfor-]

mance test that examines memory and attentional
functions.
### N [Boston Naming Test (BNT)][35][: Patients must name 60 large]

ink drawings that are presented to them by the examiner.

The test is discontinued after eight consecutive failures.
When the patient fails to name the drawing, the examiner
provides a semantic cue; if still unable to name the
drawing, a phonemic cue is provided.
### N [Verbal fluency][: This includes letter generation (letter P) and]

animal fluency tests.
### N [The story recall subtest from the Rivermead Behavioral Memory]

Test (RBMT)[36]: Patients listen to a short passage of a prose
being read aloud and then recall as much as they can.
### N [Rapid Disability Rating Scale—2 (RDRS-2)][37][: This is an]

assessment of three functional and behavioural areas:
(a) help with activities of daily living, (b) degree of
disability, and (c) degree of special problems (ie, mental
confusion, uncooperativeness and depression). The RDRS-2
was administered at baseline and at 24-week follow-up
examination.
### N [GDS][31][: This is a staging system of seven distinguishable]

cognitive and functional stages, ranging from normal
(stage 0) to severe dementia (stage 7). All patients in the
study had a GDS stage 4.

The primary and secondary outcome measures were
administered to all participants in the experimental and IPP
control groups at all visits. Owing to manpower limitations,
the BNT, verbal fluency tests and RBMT (all secondary
outcome measures) were not administered to the ChEI
control group at any visit.

INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA INTERVENTION
Patients in the experimental group received a total of 72 IMIS
sessions, three times a week for 24 weeks. All of the patients
in the experimental group had the same computerised
activities, order of presentation and session length. During
the first 24 sessions, the IMIS sessions lasted only 15 min.
Sessions 25–28 lasted 20 min, and sessions 29–72 lasted
25 min. Because this was the first time that such a
computerised multimedia program was applied for the
cognitive stimulation of these patients, it was necessary to
ensure tolerability and adequate dose to avoid fatigue or
other possible negative effects that might arise from exposure
to a PC. A minimum requirement was that the participants
completed 58 of 72 (80%) sessions, with an interruption of no
more than 10 days between sessions; all participants met this
criterion.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The data were analysed using SPSS V.12. Descriptive
statistics were prepared at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks.
Outcomes were assessed using one-way analysis of variance
at each of the three critical time points.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the groups.

No significant differences were observed between the three
study groups on the ADAS-Cog (F2,42 = 0.67) or SKT
(F2,42 = 0.84) at baseline, although the experimental group
had slightly lower MMSE scores than the other groups
(F2,42 = 3.33, p = 0.046; table 2). There were no differences
between the experimental and the IPP control groups on the
other neuropsychological measures at baseline examination
(the ChEI control group did not receive these additional four
tests; table 2).

After 12 weeks of treatment, the three study groups
differed in terms of the ADAS-Cog (F2,42 = 7.05, p = 0.002,
r = 0.50) and the MMSE (F2,42 = 10.3, p,0.001, r = 0.57;
fig 1). Both experimental and IPP control groups were
superior to the ChEI control group on the ADAS-Cog (Dlysergic acid diethylamide test, p,0.05), and all three groups


differed from each other on the MMSE (D-lysergic acid
diethylamide test, p,0.05). After 24 weeks, group differences
were still apparent on the ADAS-Cog (F2,42 = 3.08, p = 0.06,
r = 0.36) and MMSE (F2,42 = 8.48, p = 001, r = 0.54).
Reanalyses showed that the experimental group was better
than the ChEI control group on the ADAS-Cog (p,0.05),
whereas the experimental and IPP control groups differed
from the ChEIs control group on the MMSE (p,0.05; fig 2).
There was no significant change in SKT scores over 24 weeks
across all three groups (F2,39 = 0.83), and no significant
group by time interaction (F2,39 = 1.93, p = 0.11, r = 0.30).

Measures at week 12 and 24 are shown as compared with
baseline (table 3).

No significant differences were observed in the functional
assessments, as measured by the RDRS-2 at baseline
examination (experimental group mean: 26.6 (SD 0.96),
IPP control: 27.3 (0.93), ChEI control: 24.4 (1.0); F2,42 = 2.16,
p = 0.12, r = 0.32), or after 24 weeks of follow-up (experimental group: 25.3 (1.1), IPP control: 25.6 (1.0), ChEI
control: 23.7 (1.2); F2,42 = 0.76, p = 0.47, r = 0.14). The GDS
stage was 4 in all patients at baseline and in all follow-up
evaluations.

Figure 3 shows the mean difficulty level obtained by the
patients over the course of the 24 weeks of treatment in each
of the six cognitive domains of the IMIS. Performance in all
cognitive domains showed an improvement, but most
especially in the measures of attention and memory. In no
case did a patient’s performance level for any individual
activity actually decline over the course of the 24 weeks.

DISCUSSION
This study shows that both classic cognitive stimulation
treatment and computer-based treatment improved cognition
in patients who were treated with a stable dose of ChEI,
compared with those who were treated only with ChEIs. In
addition, the IMIS program provided an improvement above
and beyond that seen with classic cognitive stimulation, with
improvement lasting 24 weeks. Not only did ADAS-Cog and
MMSE scores fail to decline (as was seen in the ChEIs control
group) but scores also actually improved, and the improvement was maintained over the 24 weeks that the IMIS was
part of the treatment programme.

The progression of illness observed in the ChEI control
group is consistent with what has previously been described
in subjects with prolonged exposure to ChEIs (.1 year).[38] On
average, this group declined at a rate of approximately 2–3
MMSE points per year, which is slightly slower than is
typical, but falls within the range of expected decline in mild
Alzheimer’s disease.[39]

These results show that it is possible to augment the effects
of cholinesterase inhibition using cognitive stimulation
procedures, with the result that patients have improved
outcomes. These findings from the experimental group
cannot be explained simply by increased social contact or
interactions, as the experimental group and the IPP control
group attended the daycare centre. The IMIS greatly
augmented the traditional psychomotor stimulation, because
when both treatments were used together efficacy was
extended to 24 weeks. Thus, it seems that an individually
constrained cognitive stimulation program such as the IMIS
used here is more efficacious than treatment only with drugs,
and at least augments traditional psychostimulation. In
regard to the possible effects of IMIS-alone treatment, we
hypothesise that it would represent an improvement compared with non-treated patients and also with patients
treated with ChEIs alone, as shown in previous studies.[27 40]

The degree of difficulty of the problems is individually
adjusted to maximise success (and increase the challenges)
for each patient. Although an understanding of the

physiological basis of the efficacy of these individualised
cognitive stimulation programs is beyond the scope of this
initial study, our findings and data from others suggest that
plasticity remains possible in patients with Alzheimer’s
disease at the cellular level, and that these changes can
modify disease progression.[22–26] Cellular plasticity could thus
provide a substrate on which the improvements observed
here could be based.

No functional improvement was noted among the three
groups. This may be explained by the fact that these were
mildly impaired patients (mean MMSE was 22.0), who
retained the physical or functional ability to participate in a
cognitive or motor stimulation program, and did not exhibit
disruptive behaviours. Similarly, the ChEI control group was
only mildly impaired, and they had sufficient support from
their care giver to come to the clinic for frequent evaluations.
Therefore, any change in functional capacity could have been
more difficult to measure in this cohort than in patients in
moderate or severe stages of dementia. In addition, it is
possible that the functional measures used in this study were
not sensitive enough to detect subtle change.

There have been multiple methodological approaches to
explore the benefits of non-pharmacological treatments in
patients with Alzheimer’s disease. These included studies of:
### N [memory training in one specific task (eg, errorless learning]

paradigm) and its effects on memory function,[41 42] or on

Figure 1 Mini-Mental State Examination mean change at 12 and
24 weeks. ChEI, cholinesterase inhibitor; IPP, integrated

other cognitive functions[43] or activities of daily living
(ADLs)[44];
### N [training in ADLs (procedural memory stimulation) and its]

effects on the same tasks[45];
### N [psychosocial intervention programmes (ie, reality orienta-]

tion treatment)[46];
### N [combination of cognitive stimulation and counselling]

(patients and care givers)[47];
### N [combination of cognitive rehabilitation with mental]

stimulation techniques[48];
### N [combination of cognitive enhancers and computerised]

cognitive training[49]; and
### N [comprehensive cognitive and motor stimulation pro-]

grammes.[16]

Although these approaches show varying degree of benefits
from non-pharmacological interventions in patients with
Alzheimer’s disease, it is difficult to establish comparisons
among studies, as the outcome measures and duration of the
interventions were not the same, especially when compared
with drug trials. Studies of non-pharmacological interventions should, therefore, use the same outcome measures and
study duration as the pharmacological trials to provide a
better perspective of the effects of non-pharmacological
treatments. This study used the ADAS-Cog and MMSE,
which are the standard cognitive measures used in drug
trials; participants who had cognitive or motor stimulation

treatment had improved scores, and this effect was enhanced
by the use of a computerised program.

One of the limitations of the study is that we were unable
to complete the neuropsychological battery (secondary outcomes) in the ChEI control group. Therefore, we could not
further expand our analysis to specific cognitive domains.
The improvement seen with the ADAS-Cog and the MMSE
was not seen with the SKT. This discrepancy could be
explained by assessing whether these treatments have
beneficial effects in some cognitive domains, and not in
others. However, the limited scope of the cognitive functions
assessed by the SKT, and a possible ceiling effect in mildly
impaired patients can also explain these findings.

The patients in the experimental and the IPP control
groups were in the daycare centre; the only difference
between the groups was that the experimental group received
the IMIS. Patients in these groups were drawn from the same
institution, where the IPP program is used in all patients.
Therefore, we could not create a group of patients receiving
daycare only, as patients could not be isolated from their
daily stimulation routines (which are an integral part of the
daycare program).

on each cognitive function over a 24-week training period.


Although this was a trial of a non-pharmacological
intervention, one way to conceptualise the design is to
consider that we were able to evaluate ‘‘dose’’ and ‘‘tolerability’’. In this context, the ‘‘dose’’ refers to the amount of
time each day that a patient could engage in the IMIS.
Similarly, we could consider the patient’s willingness to
complete the assigned tests on schedule as a measure of
‘‘tolerability’’. Therefore, we started with sessions of 15 min
of duration and increased them to 25 min, and all patients
completed the minimum requirement of 58 sessions.

Future research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of the
IMIS-type programs in larger, more diverse populations to
understand factors that may modify the response, as well as
to establish its long-term effects (.1 year). The IMIS should
be tested outside the controlled clinical environment (ie,
home-based) to determine the efficacy of ‘‘distance therapy’’
in Alzheimer’s disease. Nevertheless, the results of this study
suggest that this is a promising avenue of approach to help
maximise a patient’s cognitive functions in the context of a
progressive degenerative disease, potentially altering the
effect of the condition on both the patients and the care
givers.
