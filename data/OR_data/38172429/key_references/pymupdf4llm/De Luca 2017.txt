_Background: Cognitive impairment after stroke is common and can cause disabil-_
ity with a high impact on quality of life and independence. Cognitive rehabilitation
is a therapeutic approach designed to improve cognitive functioning after central
nervous system’s injuries. Computerized cognitive rehabilitation (CCR) uses multimedia and informatics resources to optimize cognitive compromised performances.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of pc cognitive training with Erica
software in patients with stroke. Methods: We studied 35 subjects (randomly divided
into 2 groups), affected by either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, having attended from January 2013 to May 2015 the Laboratory of Robotic and Cognitive
Rehabilitation of Istituto di Ricerca e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Neurolesi in Messina.
Cognitive dysfunctions were investigated through a complete neuropsychological battery, administered before (T0) and after (T1) each different training. Results:
At T0, all the patients showed language and cognitive deficits, especially in attention process and memory abilities, with mood alterations. After the rehabilitation
program (T1), we noted a global cognitive improvement in both groups, but a
more significant increase in the scores of the different clinical scales we administered was found after CCR. Conclusions: Our data suggest that cognitive pc training
by using the Erica software may be a useful methodology to increase the poststroke cognitive recovery. Key Words: Cognitive rehabilitation—computerized
training—neuropsychology—functional recovery.

The typical clinical strategy of recovery in patients affected by stroke is to minimize the initial damage and
thereby to improve the amount of functional recovery.
Following stroke, it is possible that recovery could spontaneously occur, and improvement in neuropsychological
functioning is generally observed for at least 2 years after
brain injury. Indeed, Robertson and Murre indicated that
there are 3 groups of recovery likelihood: spontaneous
recovery, assisted recovery, and no recovery.[12]

Rehabilitative treatment, through integrative approaches, should allow a shifting from the simple
remediation/compensation dichotomy to a more valid skills
transfer and generalization.
Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is becoming a standard
component of neurorehabilitation after stroke, given that
there is important clinical and research evidence of efficacy in improving cognitive and psychosocial functioning
in patients with brain injury.[13,14]

CR refers to 2 major categories of techniques, that is,
traditional and computer-assisted, computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation (CCR).
In both cases, the cognitive training implements the
residual neuropsychological abilities through specific strategies based on cognitive models. In particular, CCR uses
multimedia and informatics resources with specific hardware system and software, to implement the cognitive
training[15,16] for memory,[17] attention,[18] problem solving, and
job simulation,[19] language,[20] praxis,[21] and processing speed.[22]

Some clinical trials for stroke patients with neuropsychological deficits showed that the experimental group
(performing computerized training) had a greater improvement than the control group (performing only
conventional treatment, i.e., pen-and-paper exercises) in


different cognitive domains, such as attention, memory,
visual, and auditory learning.[23]

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of CCR,
by using the software Erica, on cognitive and daily life
performance, in stroke patients with cognitive impairment.

#### Material and Methods

_Study Population_

Thirty-five patients (mean ± SD age: 43.15 ± 16.85 years;
48.57% female) were enrolled in this study and randomized into either the control (CG: n = 15) or the experimental
(EG: n = 20) groups. A more detailed description of the
2 groups is in Table 1.
The patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups
(experimental or standard treatment) in order of recruiting.
This clinical, single-blind, randomized trial involved 35
stroke participants. All the patients needed CR based on
medical and neuropsychological team’s diagnosis. The
sample was enrolled from January 2013 to May 2015 at
the Laboratory of Robotic and Cognitive Rehabilitation
of Istituto di Ricerca e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Neurolesi
of Messina. The study was approved by the Local Ethical
Committee. No participant was excluded from the study.
Either the patient or the legal representative were adequately informed about the study and offered their
collaboration and written consent.
The patients enrolled were in a chronic phase (i.e., 3-6
months from the acute neurological event). The EG consisted of 20 participants (11 men and 9 women, with a
mean age of 43.9 years ± 16.6), whereas the CG consisted of 15 participants (7 men and 8 women, with a
mean age of 42.1 ± 17.7). As shown in Table 1 the 2 groups

were matched for age, sex, and educational level. Inclusion criteria were (1) diagnosis of vascular brain injury
of either hemorrhagic or ischemic etiology (the latter involving the middle cerebral artery); (2) presence of
moderate cognitive impairment, that is, Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) score ranging from 12 to 20; (3)
absence of severe spasticity with an Ashworth Scale less
than 3; (4) absence of disabling sensory alterations (i.e.,
hearing and visual loss), and of severe medical and psychiatric illness according to the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) and
International Classification of Diseases-10.

_Procedures_

Each patient was submitted to a complete neuropsychological evaluation before and after the rehabilitative
treatment (T0 and T1, respectively). Neuropsychological
assessment consisted of a screening test, that is, the MMSE,
and specific test for different cognitive domains, including the Category Verbal Fluency (CVF), Letter Verbal
Fluency, the Reversal Motor Learning (RML), the Attentive Matrices (AM), and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning
Test (RAVLI immediate and late RAVLR recall). The functional scales, which were filled with the help of the
caregivers, included Basic Activities of Daily Living (ADL)
and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Levels
of Cognitive Functioning (LCF), and Barthel Index (BI).
Depression and anxiety scales (i.e., Hamilton Rating Scale
for Anxiety, HRS-A, and for Depression, HRS-D) were
also administered.
All the study participants underwent the same traditional CR, 6 times a week for 8 weeks (i.e., 48 sessions
of 45 minutes each). In addition, the EG was submitted
to the pc-based Erica training, consisting of 24 sessions
of 45 minutes each, 3 times a week for 8 weeks, whereas
the CG performed only CR (24 sessions, 3 times a week
for 8 weeks).
To summarize, the 2 groups were submitted to the same
amount of neurorehabilitation, but only the EG performed CCR.
Pc-cognitive training was realized by means of an Italian
computerized cognitive tool, Erica (with a user license
[of 3 years; www.erica.giunti.it), which consists of a number](http://www.erica.giunti.it)
of personalized pc exercises, articulated in 5 specific cognitive domains: attention process, memory abilities, spatial
cognition, verbal and nonverbal executive functions. This
platform of neuropsychological rehabilitation is characterized by modularity, flexibility, and uniformity in the
type of task and in the administered program. A trained
cognitive therapist provided exercises with a growing hierarchy of complexity through the Erica rehabilitative
platform: the exercises’ difficulty was flexible to the progressive changes of the patient’s performance, and
consistently ensured effective and pleasant rehabilitation sessions.


CR consisted in a face-to-face approach between the
patient and the therapist that was administered in individual sessions. Training was customized for the needs
of each patient. Indeed, tasks were presented using a paperand-pencil modality, and these were specifically built to
stimulate specific cognitive skills (16).

_Statistical Analysis_

Data were analyzed using the R version 3.4.0, considering a P < .05 as statistically significant. Normal distribution
of a sample was investigated through the Shapiro test,
whereas the Fisher test was used for comparing the variances of 2 samples from normal population.
Using the car package of R, for any outcome measure,
we performed a repeated measure within-subject analysis of variance for unbalanced design. We included into
the model the 2-level variable “group” (1 = experimental; 0 = control), as between factor, and the 2-level variable
“evaluation time” (T0, T1), as within factor. We also included an interaction term for group and evaluation time.
The Student’s t test for unpaired sample and the Fisher
exact test were used to compare 2 groups (intergroup analysis), where appropriate. The Student’s t test for paired
sample was used to compare each group between the baseline and the end of the study (intragroup analysis). Finally,
in order to investigate whether the improvement was more
significant in the experimental group rather than in the
control group, we compared the test score variations from
baseline to follow-up (i.e., for each clinical test we computed the difference between the 2 evaluation times as
|score at T1 to score at T0|) by the one-tailed Student’s
_t test._

#### Results

At baseline, no significant differences between the EG
and the CG were found.
There were no significant differences between the 2
groups on score variation from T0 to T1, but rather an
effect due to the time for most of the scales/tests: MMSE
(F = 17.84; P < .001), Letter Verbal Fluency (F = 4.87; P = .034),
Digit Span (F = 12.20; P = .001), Token Test (F = 8.26;
_P = .007), Ideomotor Apraxia (F = 5.25; P = .028), Con-_
structive Apraxia (F = 13.52; P < .001), RAV (F = 11.37;
_P = .002), and Boston Naming Test (F = 15.37; P < .001)._
However, the interaction “group × evaluation time” was
significant statistically for MMSE (F = 12.40; P = .001), CVF
(F = 5.38; P = .027), and AM (F = 10.65; P = .002) models.
Although no significant differences between the EG and
the CG at T1 were found, the intragroup comparisons
showed some improvements in many clinical scales, especially for the EG (see Table 2). Finally, comparing the
test score variations from baseline to follow-up (Fig 1),
we found that the improvement in MMSE (t = 3.34;
_P = .001), CVF (t = 2.55; P = .008), AM (t = 1.18; P < .001),_
as well as BNT (t = 1.72; P = .047), HRS-A (t = 1.96; P = .030),

#### Discussion

Emerging cognitive interventions, including CCR, virtual
reality, and telemedicine system may be useful to optimize the quality and efficacy of rehabilitation in individuals
with neurological disorders, such as stroke.[24] In


particular, the use of pc-cognitive retraining has multiple potential benefits within the rehabilitative setting
following brain injury: the repeatability of cognitive tasks,
the rapid presentation of stimuli with multisensory stimulation, so as to boost neural plasticity and thus functional
recovery. The rehabilitation carried out by pc-based trainings allows strengthening of the residual cognitive abilities
as demonstrated by Fernandez et al, who considered the
effect of the computer-based cognitive training on 50

patients affected by brain injury, observing an increase
in the attention and memory processes.[25] Our results
suggest that cognitive pc training, in addition to standard neurorehabilitation, may be a promising tool to
optimize the global neuropsychological and functional recovery in poststroke patients. Indeed, the concomitant use
of pc training may allow a significant increase in overall
functioning and a positive influence in the optimization
of specific cognitive and functional domains. Despite these
results, there are only few evidences, concerning the CCR
efficacy on the cognitive impairment in the patients affected by brain injury, including stroke. Among these, a
very interesting study by Chen et al demonstrated a significant improvement in the global cognitive function in
the individuals with traumatic brain injury who were submitted to CCR.[26] Another study by Lundqvist et al showed
an improvement in the memory processes in 21 patients with acquired brain injury undergoing computerized
memory training.[27] These results, confirmed by our work,
demonstrated that neuropsychological computerized rehabilitation could have a relevant impact in the
rehabilitative outcomes of poststroke patients. Moreover, recent studies have highlighted the potentiality of
the CCR supporting the global efficacy of such approach for the recovery of patients affected by different
neurological disorders.[28,29]

The novelty of this work is that it was the first time
Erica, a specific software for the cognitive impairment
treatment, was used in patients with stroke. Indeed, a
recent review has demonstrated that CCR may be considered a good tool to optimize rehabilitation outcomes
following brain injury.[28] Moreover, different neurophysiological strategies, with regard to transcranial magnetic
stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation,
are demonstrating a positive effect in promoting neuroplasticity of the injured brain area, and thus better
functional and cognitive recovery.[30,31]

The main limitation of the study is that the sample is
small and probably it is not sufficient to prove the real
efficacy of CCR in the stroke population. Moreover, we
have investigated patients affected by either ischemic or
hemorrhagic stroke, which may have different kinds of
functional recovery. Thus, it could be interesting to evaluate a more homogeneous sample of ischemic patients,
presenting possible more homogeneous side lesions. In
spite of this, the study also shows some strength, as the
presence of a control group and a careful assessment of
the cognitive functions.
In conclusion, our data suggest that the PC-cognitive
training can be an additional approach for cognitive rehabilitation after stroke, to improve the cognitive recovery
and the patients’ global functioning, especially concerning the semantic/verbal fluidity and the short-term
memory. In the near future, further larger sample studies
should be carried out, to confirm these promising results
and evaluate the long-term effects.
