ABSTRACT
Objective: Deficits in working memory (WM) are associated
with age-related decline. We report findings from a clinical trial
that examined the effectiveness of Cogmed, a computerized
program that trains WM. We compare this program to a Sham
condition in older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).
Method: Older adults (N = 68) living in the community were
assessed. Participants reported memory impairment and met
criteria for MCI, either by poor delayed memory or poor performance in other cognitive areas. The Repeatable Battery for the
Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS, Delayed
Memory Index) and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR)
were utilized. All presented with normal Mini Mental State
Exams (MMSE) and activities of daily living (ADLs). Participants
were randomized to Cogmed or a Sham computer program.
Twenty-five sessions were completed over five to seven weeks.
Pre, post, and follow-up measures included a battery of cognitive measures (three WM tests), a subjective memory scale, and
a functional measure.
Results: Both intervention groups improved over time. Cogmed
significantly outperformed Sham on Span Board and exceeded
in subjective memory reports at follow-up as assessed by the
Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ). The Cogmed group
demonstrated better performance on the Functional Activities
Questionnaire (FAQ), a measure of adjustment and far transfer,
at follow-up. Both groups, especially Cogmed, enjoyed the
intervention.
Conclusion: Results suggest that WM was enhanced in both
groups of older adults with MCI. Cogmed was better on one core
WM measure and had higher ratings of satisfaction. The Sham
condition declined on adjustment.

##### (Reichman, Fiocco, & Rose, 2010). This is likely to increase measurably. Several reviews, as addressed below, are now suggesting that cognitive training (CT) is helpful for impaired older adults. This change is in spite of many studies that caution the application of CT (e.g., Owen et al., 2010).
 If aging compromises the basic operating characteristics of biological hardware, then CT and experience may benefit many from decompensating further into a degenerative disease (Mayr, 2008). For normal older adults, there is a constantly adapting central nervous system as the aging brain seeks to compensate for deficits—plasticity, brain reserve, and enriched environments (Bryck & Fisher, 2012; Reuter-Lorenz & Park, 2010). Targeting cognitive tasks that are more encompassing (e.g., executive functioning, set shifting, inhibition, updating) can make a difference in functional or far-transfer outcomes (Dahlin, Neely, Larsson, Bäckman, & Nyberg, 2008). This has been labeled as working memory (WM) training. In addition, more “holistic” CT can provide benefits that extend beyond attention and WM if applied to complex goal-directed activity (e.g., Basak, Boot, Voss, & Kramer, 2008; Stine-Morrow, Parisi, Morrow, & Park, 2008).
 In this article we address the impact of a CT computer program, Cogmed, on older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We conducted a clinical trial on Cogmed against a Sham condition, and assessed whether such training can make a difference in cognition and adjustment. First, we briefly discuss overall cognitive training, then consider WM and problems with training of older adults, and last discuss Cogmed.

 Overall training


##### Recent reviews from the National Institute of Health Conference for Alzheimer’s Disease and Cognitive Decline (2011) that assessed 6,713 studies on risks and protective components for factors related to cognitive decline, found that CT and behavioral factors are associated with sizable risk reduction for cognitive decline. Accumulating research continues to demonstrate that older adults who are impaired benefit from CT (e.g., Belleville et al., 2011; Jean, Bergeron, Thivierge, & Simard, 2010; Loewenstein, Acevedo, Czaja, & Duara, 2004; Olazarán et al., 2010). The majority of studies targeted episodic memory while many addressed other cognitive domains: attention, speed of processing, lan- guage, visual spatial abilities, and executive functioning. Several involved com- puterized programs facilitating an individual approach (see Hyer, Mullen, & McKenzie, 2015).
 In addition to many reviews of the value of CT on normal older adults (e.g., Valenzuela & Sachdev, 2009) and increasingly on dementia (e.g., De Werd, Boelen, Rikkert, & Kessels, 2013), there are now several reviews addressing MCI and the value of CT (Belleville, 2008; Buschert et al., 2011; Jak, Seelye, & Jurick, 2013; Jean et al., 2010; Li et al., 2008; Melby-Lervåg & Hulme, 2013;

The overall conclusion of these reviews was that amnestic-MCI patients are capable of learning new information and memory strategies. However, there is a com- plex interaction between cognitive reserve (education, occupation, IQ, leisure, CT), and biomarkers of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration that are modu- lated by the benefits of CT. In summary, Jak and colleagues (2013), note that researchers are examining how CT packages can alter the negative cognitive aging outcomes, combat cognitive consequences of medical conditions, and improve mental sharpness in day-to-day life. Additionally, comprehensive or multifactorial training programs have been found to be successful in elderly adult populations (Floyd & Scogin, 1997; Rebok, Carlson, & Langbaum, 2007; Verhaeghen, Marcoen, & Goossens, 1992).

 Working memory/durability/function


##### Training of WM has been identified as one of the main factors underlying cognitive impairment in old age as well as dementia (Bäckman, Jones, Berger, Laukka, & Small, 2005; Bäckman & Small, 2007; Baddeley, Bressi, Della Sala, Logie, & Spinnler, 1991; Craik & Bialystok, 2006; Salthouse, 2001). WM is a capacity limited mental workspace (Morrison & Chein, 2011) that serves as an active short-term maintenance of information in the service of more complex tasks such as mental arithmetic, language comprehension, planning, and problem-solving (Cowan et al., 2005; Shah & Miyake, 1999).
 Clinical trials examining the effects of WM strategies in healthy older adults are generally positive (Ball et al., 2002; Cavallini, Pagnin, & Vecchi, 2003; Ercoli, Siddarth, Harrison, Jimenez, & Jarvik, 2005; Ercoli et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2009; Valentijn et al., 2005; Willis et al., 2006). CT in the form of WM training improves speed of processing (Ball et al., 2002), attention (e.g., Bherer et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2009), fluid intelligence (Engle, Kane & Tuholski, 1999), language acquisition (Baddeley et al., 1991), reading comprehension (Chein & Morrison, 2010; Daneman & Carpenter, 1980), problem-solving (Logie, Gilhooly, & Wynn, 1994), reasoning (Kane et al., 2004), and cognitive control (Chein & Morrison, 2010; Klingberg et al., 2005; Klingberg, Forssberg, & Westerberg, 2002). Thus, WM may serve as a domain-general cognitive resource that modulates ability in a number of seemingly disparate areas of cognitive performance.
 Results of these articles varied based on the type of task used in training, duration, condition of subjects (age and health), use of an active control group, and nature of training (verbal, visual, spatial, combined). Virtually all studies reported gains in the trained task (e.g., Borella, Carretti, Riboldi, & De Beni, 2010; Borella, Carretti, Zanoni, Zavagnin, & De Beni, 2013) and some showed gains in far transfer tasks (e.g., Jaeggi et al., 2010). Few studies have evaluated

##### functional outcomes, such as activities of daily living (ADLs) (Belleville et al., 2006; Kurz, Pohl, Ramsenthaler, & Sorg, 2009; Rozzini et al., 2007; Willis et al., 2006). It has been argued that more performance-based tasks related to instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) should be applied in training and used as outcome measures (Acevedo & Loewenstein, 2007).

 Cogmed and MCI


##### Cogmed focuses on WM training, specifically on the ability to hold and manipulate information for short periods of time. The computer program (Cogmed QM©) draws on the integrity of the prefrontal cortex, which demon- strates pronounced morphological alterations across the adult life span. The intervention involves challenging adaptive training on various non-verbal WM tasks (Westerberg et al., 2007). All tasks involve: (1) maintenance of multiple stimuli at the same time, (2) short delays, during which the representation of stimuli should be held in WM, (3) unique sequencing of stimuli in each trial, and (4) the adaptive difficulty as a function of individual performance.
 Recent studies using Cogmed or Cogmed-like tasks show that training leads to improvements on trained tasks and some have demonstrated generalization of improvements that were not part of the training (Buschkuehl et al., 2008; Dahlin et al., 2008; Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Jonides, & Perrig, 2008; Klingberg et al., 2005; Persson & Reuter-Lorenz, 2008; Westerberg et al., 2007). Research on older adults has been limited to only a few studies on community samples (Brehmer, Westerberg, & Bäckman, 2012; McNab et al., 2009; Olesen, Westerberg, & Klingberg, 2004), adults after stroke (Westerberg et al., 2007), and adults with cognitive deficits as a result of brain injury (Johansson & Tornmalm, 2012; Lundqvist, Grundström, Samuelsson, & Rönnberg, 2010; Westerberg et al., 2007).
 In this study, we report findings from a clinical trial that examined the effectiveness of Cogmed on older adults with MCI compared to a Sham condition. Participants met criteria for MCI (see below). Participants were randomized to either Cogmed or to a Sham non-adaptive cognitive computer program; 25 sessions were completed over five to seven weeks. Measures included a battery of cognitive and functional scales that were administered pre, post, and 12 weeks following the intervention. This study also evaluated subjective memory and satisfaction.

 Method


##### Participants

 All participants were older adults (≥ 65 years of age) who presented with memory complaints and demonstrated some impairment upon screening

##### (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, RBANS; Delayed Memory Index) and did not have difficulties with ADLs. A core criterion for inclusion was meeting generally accepted criteria for MCI (Andreescu et al., 2014). This construct has been traditionally defined as amnestic-MCI (a-MCI) and non-amnestic MCI (non-aMCI). For our purposes, the former group had a RBANS Delayed Memory score of <85, one standard deviation lower than average. Those who scored below 2 standard deviations, ≤70, were excluded from the study. The non-aMCI met different criteria (see below).
 Participants were residents of the local community, had a Mini Mental State Examination score >24, and met criteria for MCI. The average MMSE score was 26. To rule out dementia, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-Text Revised (American Psychiatric Association & American Psychiatric Association, 2000) and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) (McKhann et al., 1984) guidelines were applied as diagnostic criteria.
 The average RBANS Delayed Memory for the participants in the a-MCI group was 77.6, SD = 6.8, of which 75% met this criteria. For the other 25% who met criteria for non-aMCI, (n = 16; RBANS Delayed Memory Index M = 91.4; SD = 5.4), two criteria were required: (1) Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) score of .50 (questionable impairment), and (2) lower scores on RBANS Immediate Memory (a new learning task, < 85). These two MCI types were combined for group randomization. On core measures at post-follow-up, there were no differences between these two MCI types.
 The MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Sheehan et al., 2010) was utilized to screen for depression and anxiety diagnoses. While many presented with such symptoms, none met full criteria for these diagnoses. Participants were referrals from medical school physicians in a large family health clinic. Medical records of potential participants were reviewed for other diagnoses, medications, results of CT or MRI scans, and general medical history. Individuals with psychiatric diagnoses and/or taking cognitive enhancers were excluded from the study. All participants had access to a caregiver. One hundred ten older adults were referred for memory problems. Forty-two were excluded due to having either severe or no objective memory problems (RBANS Delayed Memory Index ≤ 70 or > 85, respectively).
 There were a total of 68 participants who completed the study; 34 in Cogmed and 34 in Sham conditions. Participants were considered “completers” when they attended 80% of training sessions and competed assessments at each time point. Nine participants dropped out of the study; five from Cogmed and four from Sham. Dropouts occurred due to compliance (four), hospitalization (three), travel issues (one), and issues with caregivers (one). There were no differences between the groups on demographic markers (see Table 1).

##### The average age of study participants was just over 75 years, most were married, white, had at least a high school education, and presented with few depressive symptoms. Participants reportedly took an average of four medications and rated their health as good.


##### Measures

 The RBANS Delayed Memory (or Immediate Memory for the non-MCI), as well as the CDR, were utilized for inclusion criteria. Participants completed a series of assessments and questionnaires prior to the intervention, one-week following the completion of the intervention, and three months post intervention. Measures included Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition Span Board subtest (Wechsler, 1997a), Trail Making (Parts A and B) (Reitan & Wolfson, 1993), and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition Letter Number Sequencing subtest (Wechsler, 1997b). Adjustment and satisfaction measures included the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) (Pfeffer, Kurosaki, Chance, Filos, & Bates, 1984) and the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) (Broadbent, Cooper, FitzGerald, & Parkes, 1982). The Cogmed Satisfaction Questionnaire (6 questions) was adminis- tered at post intervention, as we were only interested in this at the end of CT.


##### Procedure

 After meeting study requirements, each subject was informed of the study, signed consent forms, and was randomly assigned to one of the two groups; Cogmed or Sham condition. All subjects believe that they were receiving a valued new computerized CT program and the study was to determine which CT program was better.
 Sessions (25) were completed over a 5- to 7-week period for approximately 40 minutes per day. The exercises were divided between 8 different tasks each

##### day that selected from a bank of 13 tasks. For Cogmed, each training task involved the temporary storage and manipulation of sequential visuospatial and/or verbal information. The comparison condition (Sham) involved the same training program as Cogmed without adaptivity. The difficulty level remained constant across the entire intervention, never increasing to three iterations above baseline. Participants completed the training at the clinic or at their home using a personal computer. To assure blindness to condition, all brand names were removed from the training software. Those in the Sham condition were offered the Cogmed training after completion of the study.
 Each participant (Cogmed and Sham) had a coach; a person who assured that the tasks were completed properly, in a timely manner, and had rewards distinct for each person as part of the process (e.g., special meal or snack). Coaches were asked to employ these as incentives for compliance. Coaches consisted of spouses/significant others (82%), adult children (16%) and friends (2%). Each group also had a group coach who monitored daily results and could respond immediately. This coach worked with the individual coaches of both groups on a weekly basis to assure compliance and ease of the process.

 Statistical analyses


##### The study targeted three cognitive markers of the value of intervention group (Cogmed or Sham): Span Board, Trails B, and Letter Number Sequencing. These assessments represent core cognitive abilities subserving executive functioning, verbal and non-verbal working memory, as well as speed of processing. Age correction was applied for Span Board and Letter Number Sequencing as this correction better reflected the distribution of scores. This was not the case for Trails B. We also addressed function of adjustment (FAQ, as far transfer) and subjective memory (CFQ). For these targets, we performed a univariate repeated measures analyses on pre, post, and follow-up measures using group and time as the main effects.

 Results


##### There were no significant differences on any of the pre-measures for Cogmed and Sham conditions. Results of the univariate repeated analysis on cognitive measures can be found in Table 2. While all measures indicated improvement, it is noteworthy that Span Board; perhaps closest to the content of Cogmed (non-verbal WM), was statistically significant. Importantly, improvement of both groups on cognitive measures suggests that any training is beneficial for individuals with MCI (see Figure 1).
 This same analysis was performed on overall IADLs and adjustment utilizing the FAQ (Table 3). Results demonstrate that Cogmed outperformed

##### memory performance; and therefore, compliments the objective measures. Additionally, Cogmed performed better than Sham condition on satisfaction at post intervention (t = 4.5, p < .01).


##### Discussion

 Considerable evidence exists that cognitive stimulation activities can bolster mental skills in healthy older adults (Jak et al., 2013). These benefits can persist for extended periods of time even after training has terminated. The investigation continues for specific activities that can be utilized to stave off negative cognitive aging outcomes, combat cognitive consequences of medical conditions, and improve mental sharpness.
 The present study evaluated a newer computer-based CT program, Cogmed, that addresses non-verbal WM. The present study is the first to use Cogmed with older adults who have MCI. Participants were trained on Cogmed (or Sham) five days a week for five to seven weeks. Repeated analyses revealed that both Cogmed and Sham conditions improved: Cogmed outperformed Sham on one of the three core cognitive measures, accounting for tasks highly related to WM (Span Board). Participants in the Cogmed condition also responded in a more improved manner on memory complaints and outperformed Sham subjects on overall adjustment and satisfaction.
 Conclusions based on these results are subject to interpretation. The improvement observed in both groups suggests that any CT may be of value, which is congruent with previous research. The power of placebo or non-specific effects is considerable, especially among older adults with cognitive impairment. This may be one reason that the Sham condition demonstrated general improvement in cognitive tasks. These results also occurred with Rebok and colleagues (2012) study where MCI patients and nondementing patients improved after non-specific training. An extension of this interpretation is that both groups improved because of interest and motivation.


-----

##### Our study comprised MCI participants. The results further support the current literature showing improvement in cognitive impairment in older subjects with both MCI and mild dementia. In this study, both a-MCI (75%) and non-aMCI (25%) subjects were included. There were no effects of occupation and education on cognitive outcomes (data not shown); thus brain reserve (Karp et al., 2009; Perneczky et al., 2011) was not influential.
 Our findings loosely support the idea that engaged caregivers can be beneficial. Both Cogmed and Sham conditions had an active caregiver as well as a group coach who attended to adherence and rewarded success. Stepankova, Lukavsky, Kopecek, Steinova, and Ripova (2012) showed that the use of significant others assisted in subjective memory and self-confidence for positive changes from CT. While this factor was not specifically assessed, there were no differences between groups based on compliance since virtually all participants were compliant with the study requirements. Additionally, while both groups liked the cognitive training, the Cogmed group liked the experience more than Sham. This was a positive experience.
 Importantly, Cogmed outperformed Sham on overall adjustment at follow-up. Participants in the Cogmed group largely remained stable over time whereas those in the Sham condition slightly worsened over time (Figure 2). Hutchens and colleagues (2012) found that CT resulted in benefits for MCI subjects for use of memory strategies in the context of everyday life tasks. The cognitive tasks selected as outcomes in the present study subserve general executive function and WM skills, reflective of far transfer. Therefore, training with Cogmed may be especially appealing to an older brain where this type of cognitive challenge is within the scope of ability and is novel. Naturally, the vagaries of training involve many other features, such as motivation, study design, type of population, that are not addressed here.
 There are several limitations to this study. The sample is small due to issues of recruitment. The targeted population is a difficult-to-train group, MCI. Given that various definitions of MCI are often used, we studied the two most agreed upon types, amnestic and non-amnestic types (Smith & Bondi, 2013). There were no differences between these groups, regardless of the training condition. Additionally, a control group was not employed. It cannot be said that non-specific effects were not influential since changes reflected in both groups could reflect the passage of time for older adults. This is relevant given that many individuals with MCI segue into a dementia over a year’s time, although some improve or remain stable.
 Several participants had not used computers prior to the study (n = 9). However, they were able to understand and master the program requirements quickly. Of interest, the few subjects who used the lab for this study did not differ from those who used computers within their own homes. Clearly, there are many less direct effects that older adults have that may influence results, possible lack of technology being one.


-----

##### Sustainment of training benefits and far transfer effectsare difficult to achieve. While ecologically associated markers were not assessed, an executive function scale was utilized, the FAQ. There were no negative changes on this scale for Cogmed, whereas Sham declined over time. Other studies have reported far transfer effects within older adults (Buschkuehl et al., 2008; Mahncke et al., 2006; Richmond, Morrison, Chein, & Olson, 2011). These findings are encouraging; but as Noack, Lövdén, Schmiedek, and Lindenberger (2009) caution, these results are not the norm and few studies report transfer effects for tasks dissimilar enough from the trained tasks to suggest transfer at a broad level of abilities. This study’s results apply only to the extent of the self- report FAQ representing real world far transfer; however, performance-based tasks were not administered.
 A similar limitation can be applied to durability. The study examined effects of three months post intervention. Out of the cognitive measures, Span Board was significant. Previous research has also shown gains extending a few months (Kinsella et al., 2009; Rozzini et al., 2007; Troyer, Murphy, Anderson, Moscovitch, & Craik, 2008), with some gains as far as two (Unverzagt et al., 2007) to five years (Oswald, Gunzelmann, Rupprecht, & Hagen, 2006). It was concluded by Simon and colleagues (2012) that amnestic-MCI participants are able to maintain effects over time, especially with booster sessions.
 The present study was labor intensive. Issues related to the acquisition of the subjects, caregiver buy-in, and everyday struggles of living (doctor appoint- ments, travel, etc.), were problematic. The usage of Sham was also interesting as participants enjoyed the intervention. Within a week, the authors became aware of the blind as subjects reported ease of training. Both procedures were seen as friendly and likeable. We also had small amounts of data missing (no more than 10% per scale) and did not use imputation methods.
 In sum, most research suggests that older adults require higher levels of effort for thinking as declining neurobiological efficiency accumulates. The bulk of evidence is now implying that CT can change targeted behaviors in individuals with MCI, especially areas that subserve WM. However, the level of generalizability, length of time after CT training, reasons for change (e.g., placebo individual specificity, actual target training, type of training, and type of MCI population), among other factors, are far from clear (Le Couteur & Sinclair, 2010). Even small changes in core capacities, however, can lead to large changes in complex behavior (Salthouse, 2001). From this and other studies, accumulating evidence suggests that CT does cause change and can generalize to some untrained cognitive abilities. To date, we agree with Jak and colleagues (2013); generalizability of improvements on trained tasks or untrained cognitive abilities to ecologically valid tasks of everyday cognitive and functional status have not been routinely examined or proven. Cogmed should now be favorably considered in this grouping of CT techniques. Only further study will better define the best parameters for such conclusions.
