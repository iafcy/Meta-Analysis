**ABSTRACT**
**Purpose: The objectives are to evaluate the effects of a sequential combination of aerobic exercise**
and cognitive training, compared with exercise or cognitive training alone, on cognitive function,
physical function, daily function, quality of life, and social participation in stroke survivors with
cognitive impairment.
**Methods:** This is a single-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial. Stroke patients with mild
cognitive impairment (n = 56) were randomly assigned to aerobic exercise training (n = 18),
computerized cognitive training (n = 18), and the sequential combination of aerobic exercise and
computerized cognitive training (n = 20) group. All groups underwent training 60 min/day, 3 days/
week, for a total of 12 weeks. The primary outcomes included Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(MoCA), Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition, and the Stroop color-word test. Secondary outcomes
were the Timed Up and Go test, 6-Minute Walk Test, Functional Independence Measure, Lawton
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, Community Integration Questionnaire, and Stroke
Impact Scale.
**Results:** 56 participants completed the trial. Compared with a single type of aerobic exercise or
cognitive training, the combined training group showed significant improvement in MoCA (P < .05,
η2 = 0.13), and two sub-tests in WMS-III (both P’s < 0.05) following the intervention. However, no
between-group differences were observed for physical functions, daily function, quality of life, and
social participation measures.
**Conclusions:** The findings provide evidence for the potential synergistic intervention in stroke
survivors. Future studies investigating the transfer effects and the optimal training parameters with
a larger sample is needed.

**Introduction**

Cognitive disabilities are often the most disabling
and distressing for stroke survivors, caregivers,
family members, and society.[1 ] Persistent cognitive
deficits after stroke can significantly impair inde­
pendence, activities of daily living (ADL), and
active participation in the community.[2 ] Poststroke cognitive impairment and rehabilitation
have been recognized as a top research priority.[3 ]

A systematic review showed computer-based cog­
nitive training is likely to provide some benefit in
cognitive functions for stroke survivors.[4 ] The
improvements in computer-based cognitive train­
ing were training specific (i.e. only outcomes


similar to those tasks trained improved). Physical
exercise is another intervention that may contri­
bute positively by attenuating a decline in cognitive
function in stroke survivors.[5 ] A systematic review
examined whether physical exercise interventions
improved cognitive function after stroke; a metaanalysis of nine studies showed a significant
improvement in cognitive function with an effect
size of 0.20.[5 ] The authors suggested that aerobic
exercise may increase the arousal level and reduce
depressive symptoms, which in turn leads to better
cognitive function (e.g. higher scores on the MiniMental State Examination, MMSE).[5 ] Another sys­
tematic review confirmed the beneficial role of

aerobic exercise in multiple domains of cognitive
functions such as global cognitive ability and a
potential benefit to memory, attention, and the
visuospatial domain of cognition.[6]

The combination of different training
approaches might be the most promising strategy
to delay cognitive decline and preserve cognitive
abilities. A review of multidomain interventions
suggests that strategies that target multiple factors,
such as exercise, mental training, and weight man­
agement, may be more effective in reducing cogni­
tive decline in older adults than those focusing on a
single factor.[7 ] Physical activity and cognitive train­
ing might interact to induce a larger functional
benefit in elderly individuals.[8 ]Liu-Ambrose experi­
mented with a 6-month exercise and recreation
program on executive functions in individuals
with chronic stroke and found that the combined
exercise and recreation program significantly bene­
fited executive functions in individuals who were
mildly cognitively impaired.[9 ] The potential to
further enhance cognitive training benefits is to
‘prime’ the brain by delivering aerobic exercise
training prior to cognitive training. Aerobic exer­
cise may increase arousal level, facilitate neurogen­
esis, and enhance memory consolidation, which
may be more responsive to cognitive intervention
protocols that follow.[10][,][11]

Specific training effects of cognitive training and
physical exercise training on cognitive functions in
older adults and patients with Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI) are well documented; however,
there is limited but promising evidence on the
investigation of the combined effect of cognitive
and physical training in stroke survivors with cog­
nitive impairment. There is a need to take into
account whether a combined approach may lead
to additive effects in monotype approaches and
spontaneous recovery. The present randomized
trial evaluated the effects of a sequential combina­
tion of aerobic exercise and cognitive training,
compared with exercise or cognitive training
alone, on cognitive function, physical function,
daily function, quality of life, and social participa­
tion in stroke survivors with cognitive impairment.
We hypothesized that the combination of aerobic
exercise and cognitive training would induce more
beneficial cognitive and physical effects and would
transfer to daily function, quality of life, and social


participation than pure cognitive and physical
interventions alone.

**Materials and methods**

This randomized trial used a 2 × 3 factorial design
that evaluated the clinical effectiveness of a sequen­
tial combination program of aerobic exercise com­
bined with computer-based cognitive training for
the treatment of cognitive dysfunction after stroke
(see study protocol[12]). The study recruited stroke
survivors with cognitive impairment who were ran­
domly divided into three groups: an aerobic exer­
cise training group (AE), a cognitive training group
(COG), and a sequential combination of aerobic
exercise and cognitive training (SEQ). The rando­
mization scheme was generated with the web-based
Research Randomizer randomization tool (avail­
able at [http://www.randomizer.org/). All partici­](http://www.randomizer.org/)
pants received face-to-face individualized training
in the hospitals by certified physical and/or occupa­
tional therapists for 60 minutes per day, 3 days per
week for 12 weeks. Each participant completed a
total number of 36 sessions.

**_Ethical considerations_**

This study was approved by the centralized ethics
committee (IRB# 104-4892A3) and registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02550990.
Written informed consent was obtained from all
participants prior to their participation in the
study. The design and reporting of this study fol­
lows the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of
Reporting Trials) guidelines.

**_Participation and recruitment_**

This study was conducted in the outpatient units of
the Departments of Neurology and Rehabilitation
at Chang Gung Memorial Hospitals at five branches
(Taoyuan, Chiayi, Kaohsiung, Keelung, and Taipei)
in Taiwan. Participants were recruited via a clinic
database based on diagnosis and medical referrals;
interested participants met with the study person­
nel to receive all necessary information. The parti­
cipants resolved uncertainties and were invited to
sign informed consent after an assessment of elig­
ibility criteria. The inclusion criteria were (1)


-----

unilateral ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke occur­
ring at least 6 months before enrollment; (2) age
between 20 and 90 years; (3) Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) score ≥19; (4) Montreal
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) <26; (5) selfreported or informant-reported memory or cogni­
tive complaints or Clinical Dementia Rating Scale
(CDR) score ≤0.5; (6) able to follow the study
instruction; (7) adequate cardiopulmonary func­
tion to perform the aerobic exercise; and (8) able
to walk with or without assistive devices for 10 m.
Participants were excluded if they (1) had an
unstable medical history such as recent myocardial
infarction that might limit participation; (2) had
other neurologic disorders; or (3) currently partici­
pate in other clinical trials. A priori power analysis
(G*Power software 3.1) was used to estimate the
number of participants needed for this project. On
the basis of Kim et al.,[13 ] the estimated sample size
requirement is 15 patients for each group in a
three-group study design given the lowest effect
size (f = 0.30), power of 0.80, and two-sided type I
error of 0.05. Allowing for 10% attrition at the end
of the intervention, we planned to recruit 18 parti­
cipants for each group.

**_Clinical intervention_**

**_AE training_**
The participants in the AE group performed pro­
gressive resistive stationary bicycle training[14 ]

(Figure 1). The participants first underwent

**Figure 1. Aerobic exercise training (AE).**


10 minutes of warm-up, followed by 45 minutes
of resistive aerobic exercise, followed by 5 minutes
of cool-down. The target heart rate during the
aerobic period was 40–70% of the participant’s
maximal heart rate (HRmax), calculated as
(208 − 0.7 × age).[15 ] The exercise intensity pro­
gressed as the participants improved their perfor­
mance. The exercise intensity was increased from
the initial 40–50% gradually increased to 60–70%
HRmax over the 12 weeks. The therapist monitored
closely for any adverse effects of the increased exer­
cise intensity and downward adjustments if the
exercise is not tolerated during the session.

**_COG training_**
The participants in the COG group received
computer-based cognitive training using
BrainHQ software (Posit Science Inc., San
Francisco, CA, USA)[16 ] (e.g. BrainHQ software
includes different training programs that are
designed to restore attention, recognition, color
and shape identification, calculation, visual per­
ception, visuospatial processing, memory, and
executive function). Participants performed a
variety of tasks designed to enhance different
cognitive functions. During the training sessions,
laptops with touchscreens were provided so that
the participants performed the interactive com­
puter-based games without manipulating a
mouse (Figure 2). The training program was
adjusted automatically and continuously accord­
ing to each participant’s level of performance.


-----

**Figure 2. Cognitive training (COG).**

Each cognitive intervention session was of
60 minutes.

**_SEQ training_**
The participants in the SEQ group underwent
aerobic exercise training for 30 minutes, fol­
lowed by 30 minutes of computer-based cogni­
tive training (Figure 3). The aerobic exercise
training was conducted using the progressive
resistive stationary bicycle as in the AE group
with the same training principle. The partici­
pants performed 3 minutes of warm-up, fol­
lowed by 25 minutes of aerobic resistive
exercise, and ended with 2 minutes of cool

down. After the aerobic exercise training, the
participants took part in 30 minutes of compu­
ter-based cognitive training as in the COG
group. The principles of the training program
were the same as those of the cognitive training
group. The SEQ program was also adjusted
automatically and continuously according to
each participant’s level of performance.

**_Outcome assessment_**

Cognitive and functional assessments were mea­
sured at baseline and at the end of the intervention
at 12 weeks. The evaluator for the assessments was
blinded to the group allocation.

**_Primary outcome measures_**

Primary outcome measures were cognitive func­
tions as assessed by MoCA, Wechsler Memory
Scale-Third Edition (WMS-III), and the Stroop
Color and Word Test.[17][,][18 ] MoCA is a screening
instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction, and it
assesses six different cognitive domains, including
short-term memory; visuospatial abilities; executive
functions; attention, concentration, and working
memory; language; and orientation to time and
place. The WMS-III is a standardized and reliable
neuropsychological examination tool designed to
evaluate visuospatial and memory functions. Face
recognition, verbal paired associates, word lists,
and spatial span of the WMS-III subtests were
used to assess the immediate, delayed, and working
memory.[18 ] The Stroop Color and Word Test was
used to assess the abilities of selective attention,
inhibition, and executive function.[19]

**_Secondary outcome measures_**

Secondary measures included physical functions,
ADL, instrumental AD (IADL), quality of life
(QOL), and social participation. Physical functions
were measured by the 6-Minute Walk Test
(6MWT) and the Timed Up and Go test
(TUG).[20][,][21 ] The 6MWT measures the maximum
distance walked over 6 minutes and is a common
tool to assess the endurance and mobility levels.
The TUG is a performance-based measure of func­
tional mobility by asking the participants to stand
up from a chair, walk 3 m, return to the chair, and
sit down. The Functional Independence Measure
(FIM) and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily
Living Scale (Lawton IADL) were used to evaluate
ADLs and IADL.[22][,][23 ] The Lawton IADL is an
instrument used to assess independent living skills
such as the ability to use telephone or managing
own medications. The QOL was assessed with the
Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) 3.0.[24 ] The SIS is a selfreport questionnaire that evaluates disability and
health-related QOL, such as emotion, communica­
tion, memory and thinking, and social role function
after stroke. The participant’s level of social parti­
cipation was measured using the Community
Integration Questionnaire (CIQ).[25 ] CIQ is a brief,
reliable measure of an individual’s level of integra­
tion into the home and community.


**_Statistical analyses_**

All statistical analyses were performed using PASW
Statistics 18.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
The normality of the data was checked using the
Shapiro–Wilks test and non-normally distributed
variables were rank transformed to achieve normal­
ity, followed by analysis with parametric tests. The
baseline characteristics of the participants were com­
pared using chi-square (χ[2]) tests and the Fisher's exact
test. A 2 times (pre vs. post) × 3 groups (AE vs. COG
vs. SEQ) mixed ANOVA with repeated measures on
the time factor was conducted for all the outcome
measures. If a significant interaction was found, the
least significant differences post hoc analyses were
conducted. We used the Huynh–Feldt correction
factor when the data violated the sphericity assump­
tion (Mauchly test, p < .05). The effect size (partial eta
squared, η2) was calculated to determine the group
difference for each outcome measure. The effect size
greater than 0.138 is considered to be a large effect;
between 0.138 and 0.059 is a moderate effect, and
between 0.01 and 0.059 is a small effect.[26 ]For all tests,
the statistical significance was set at p < .05.

**Results**

**_Baseline characteristics_**

Initially, 84 stroke survivors were selected and
referred from the department, 28 of them were
ineligible. Specifically, 28 interested stroke survi­
vors were excluded due to several reasons: cognitive
intact (n = 7), severe cognitive decline (n = 13),
currently participating in another study (n = 3), and
refused to participate (n = 5). Overall, 56 stroke
survivors with cognitive impairment were rando­
mized and divided into the SEQ (n = 20), AE
(n = 18), and COG (n = 18) groups and were used
in the final analysis. Figure 4 shows the CONSORT
flow diagram. No significant differences in the
baseline demographic characteristics were detected
among the groups (p > .05 for all; Table 1).

**_Primary outcome measures_**

The mixed-factor analysis of variance revealed a
significant group × time interactions for MoCA
(F2,53 = 4.05, _p = .023), Word List II (F2,53_ = 3.99,
_p = .024), and Word List IA delayed (F2,53 = 4.60, p_

= .014; Table 2). To examine this interaction, the
least significant difference post hoc analysis showed
that after the training, the SEQ group improved to a
significantly higher amount in the MoCA com­
pared with the AE (p = .019) and COG groups (p
= .017), but no between-group difference was found

for the AE and COG groups (p - .05). Similar
results were also shown for Word List II that the
SEQ group significantly improved compared with
the AE (p = .019) and the COG groups (p = .024).
Finally, for the Word List IA delayed, the SEQ and
COG groups both performed better than the AE
group (SEQ: p = .010; COG: p = .018).

For the secondary measures in TUG, 6MWT, FIM,
Lawton-IADL, CIQ, and SIS, none of the compar­
isons within and between the groups were signifi­
cant (Table 3).

**Discussion**

Comparisons of the three groups showed that the
sequential combination training resulted in the lar­
gest improvement of the general cognitive function
evaluated by MoCA compared to the single type of
training. These results partially support our
hypotheses that combined aerobic exercise and
cognitive training engender larger cognitive effects
than cognitive and exercise training alone. Positive

effects of improving general cognitive function
after stroke in favor of combined treatment were
observed. However, no significant group difference
was shown in physical functions and other healthrelated outcomes.

Aerobic exercise has been shown to enhance
post-stroke cognitive performance in the TrailMaking test, Serial Addition test, and Stroop
test.[14][,][27][,][28 ] The findings of our study are partially
consistent with the results of prior research in
supporting that aerobic exercise not only
improves general cognitive function (e.g.
MoCA) but also optimizes memory function
measured by four subtests of WMS-III. Aerobic
exercise may lead to upregulation of neuro­
trophic and vascular growth factors, such as
brain-derived neurotrophic factor.[29 ] We specu­
lated that AE does not involve the practice of
specific cognitive tasks and that improving
results on these specific cognitive tests might
not be easy. Yet, AE improved brain blood flow


and oxygen perfusion, which may evoke cortical
activation of the frontal lobe and possibly pro­
mote improvements in general cognitive
function.[30]

The superior performance in the MoCA and
WMS-III subtests in the SEQ group may have
resulted because of the fact that the aerobic exercise
before cognitive training increases the arousal level
and consolidates memory, which may benefit sub­
sequent memory retrieval and cognitive task
performance.[10][,][11 ] Our study demonstrates that the
combination of aerobic exercise and computerized
cognitive training has synergistic effects that
improve the cognitive function of stroke patients.
It may be that the combined training provided a
more varied and richer sensory and motor experi­
ence that may promote neural plasticity such as
synaptogenesis or strengthen synaptic activities.[31]

An important difference between our study and
previous work is that we investigated a variety of
outcomes related to stroke patient’s ADL, QOL,


-----

and social participation. Although sequential train­
ing may result in improvements in general and
specific cognitive domains, the training effects are
insufficient transferring to everyday functional
ADL, QOL, and social participation. In accordance
with this, a previous systematic review suggested
that cognitive improvement seems to remain con­
fined to trained cognitive functions rather than
generalizing to other daily living skills.[32 ] However,
another recent work conducted by Oh and Jung
found that a 4-week cognitive training program is
beneficial in restoring cognitive function and
improving ADL in stroke patients.[33 ] Cognitive
and physical disabilities resulting from a stroke
can possibly lead to activity limitations and partici­
pation restrictions.[34 ] Further study is needed to
investigate the transfer effect of the sequential com­
bination training on the daily functions and parti­
cipation aspects of the stroke survivors.

Our recent study investigated the psychometric
and clinimetric properties of MoCA in stroke sur­
vivors, and the minimal clinically important differ­
ence (MCID) values were estimated to be 1.22 and
2.15 according to the anchor-based and distribu­
tion-based methods, respectively.[35 ] Stroke survi­
vors who achieve the threshold value may
demonstrate a clinically important change. In the
current study, the difference in comparing pre- to
post-training are as follows: SEQ (from 19.15 to
24.25, difference = 5.1), AE (from 19.39 to 21.72,
difference = 2.33), and COG (from 20.28 to 22.57,
difference = 2.29). Three training groups have
exceeded MCID based on both anchor-based and
distribution-based methods, indicating that the
participants in each training group perceived the
training protocols as beneficial and meaningful.[35]

Some limitations of our study warrant considera­
tion. First, the SEQ group received a half dose of the
active ingredient of aerobic exercise and cognitive
training compared with the COG and AE training
groups. However, previous research has provided
little evidence of the individually optimal intensity
of aerobic exercise or computerized cognitive train­
ing of the combined program. The findings of this
study might provide the groundwork for future
investigations to explore the ideal training para­
meters. Second, the sample size was relatively small.
Follow-up studies using a larger sample for the study
are needed to validate the findings. Additional


research is needed to investigate patient characteris­
tics that influence intervention effectiveness.

Lastly, the training effects were measured immedi­
ately after the training. Whether the benefits of
sequential training can be retained over time is
unknown. The larger the sample population would
allow, a more generalized interpretation of the results.

**Conclusions**

The findings may provide evidence for the potential
synergistic intervention in cognitive function in
stroke survivors. Future studies investigating the
transfer effects and the optimal training parameters
of the sequential training with a large sample size
will be beneficial to those stroke survivors with mild
cognitive impairment.
