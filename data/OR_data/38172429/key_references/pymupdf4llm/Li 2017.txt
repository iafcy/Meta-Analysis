Background: Computerized multi-model training has been widely studied for its effect on delaying cognitive
decline. In this study, we designed the first Chinese-version computer-based multi-model cognitive training for
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Neuropsychological effects and neural activity changes assessed by
functional MRI were both evaluated.
Method: MCI patients in the training group were asked to take training 3–4 times per week for 6 months.
Neuropsychological and resting-state fMRI assessment were performed at baseline and at 6 months. Patients in
both groups were continuously followed up for another 12 months and assessed by neuropsychological tests
again.
Results: 78 patients in the training group and 63 patients in the control group accomplished 6-month follow-up.
Training group improved 0.23 standard deviation (SD) of mini-mental state examination, while control group
had 0.5 SD decline. Addenbrooke's cognitive examination-revised scores in attention (p = 0.002) and memory
(p = 0.006), as well as stroop color-word test interference index (p = 0.038) and complex figure test-copy score
(p = 0.035) were also in favor of the training effect. Difference between the changes of two groups after training
was not statistically significant. The fMRI showed increased regional activity at bilateral temporal poles, insular
cortices and hippocampus. However, difference between the changes of two groups after another 12 months was
not statistically significant.
Conclusions: Multi-model cognitive training help MCI patients to gained cognition benefit, especially in memory,
attention and executive function. Functional neuroimaging provided consistent neural activation evidence.
Nevertheless, after one-year follow up after last training, training effects were not significant. The study provided new evidence of beneficial effect of multi-model cognitive training.


Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops from preclinical state, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. The prevalence of MCI ranges
from 3% to 20% in adults over 65 years old (Gauthier et al., 2006; Jia
et al., 2014; Ravaglia et al., 2008). However, approximate 50% of MCI
patients (roughly 12% per year) will progress to AD in the following
4–5 years. Dementia due to AD has caused a high medical and economic


burden on both community and families. If any interventions could
delay disease onset or slow its progression by 1 year, there would be
much fewer cases in 2050 with reduction by nearly 9.2 million, and
thus less expenditure on care and treatment (Brookmeyer et al., 2007).
Non-pharmacological interventions have shown advantages in delaying cognitive ability declining (Li et al., 2017). There are various
approaches, including cognitive training, physical exercise, and diet
modification (Olazaran et al., 2010; Buschert et al., 2010). One famous

large-scale, randomized trial (the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly study, ACTIVE) in 2001 (Jobe et al., 2001)
had three models of cognitive training: speed of processing, memory,
and reasoning. Each intervention modified the corresponding ability,
and the effect existed for 2 years. Donostia longitudinal study designed
a structured training program covering the cognitive functions of attention, orientation, memory, language, visuo-constructive ability, executive functions, visuo-manual coordination, and praxis. The group
that received structured intervention got higher scores in nearly all
cognitive tests (Buiza et al., 2008).
Fewer cognitive interventions were specially designed for MCI patients. Memory training helped better memory performance in the following six months after training (Rapp et al., 2002). Rozzini et al.
treated a group of MCI patients with cognitive training and cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), and these patients showed greater improvement in memory, abstract reasoning, and behavioral disturbances than
the only ChEIs group (Rozzini et al., 2007). Computerized cognitive
training has been considered as a convenient and flexible method to
protect cognition (Barban et al., 2016). A meta-analysis suggested its
efficacy on global cognition, select cognitive domains, and psychosocial
functioning for MCI patients (Hill et al., 2017).
Regarding the potential neural mechanism, it is suggested that
cognitive training would modulate neural plasticity by measuring regional oxygen consumption or neural synchronization (Li et al., 2016;
Hotting et al., 2013; Chapman et al., 2015). These results were based on
healthy elders, while neural mechanism for MCI needs more evaluation.
In this study, we designed the first Chinese-version computerized
cognitive training for MCI patients. The training program comprised
eight separate tasks: visual working memory, 30-second memory, episodic memory, speed of calculation, visual search, alertness, mental
rotation, and images re-arrangement task. Both neuropsychological and
neuroimaging assessments were performed to explore the training effect and related neural activities.


2. Material and methods

2.1. Study design and patients

The study was a randomized controlled pilot trial in Rui Jin Hospital
affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine,
Shanghai, China. All patients were screened by the Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE, Chinese Version) (Katzman et al., 1988), Zung
Self-rating Anxiety Scale and Zung Self-rating Depression scale firstly.
According to ATN criteria for MCI due to AD, our diagnosis was based
on a detailed medical history, neurological examinations, global score
of clinical dementia rating scale (global score = 0.5) (Morris, 1997) and
medial temporal lobe atrophy (Alberta et al., 2011). Exclusion criteria
included evidence of stroke, Parkinson's disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and mood problems, as well as treatment with benzodiazepines, antipsychotic or antiepileptic medications.
Patients with poor vision or hearing were also excluded.
We recruited MCI patients from January 2016 to December 2016,
and the last MCI patient was enrolled on December 20, 2016. A total of
160 MCI patients were finally enrolled in Shanghai. They were randomized to the training or control group. All patients were of unrelated
Chinese Han descent with > 6 years of education. In order to minimize
Hawthorne effect (McCarney et al., 2007), both groups were told the
study purpose as observation, follow-up and early diagnosis. Only the
training group was given the information about computer-based cognitive training.
Neuropsychological assessment was done at baseline, 6-month, and
18-month. Baseline demographics included gender, age, education
level, occupation, concomitant diseases, and medications. A validated
neuropsychological battery for multiple cognitive domains was performed by trained researchers (Y. Qiao and YZ. Lu) who were blind to
grouping. It included the Chinese version of Addenbrooke's cognitive
examination-revised (ACER) (Fang et al., 2014), the auditory verbal
learning test (AVLT)-Huashan version (Zhao et al., 2012), the shape
trail test (STT, including Part A and B) (Zhao et al., 2013), the ReyOsterrieth complex figure test (CFT) (Zhao et al., 2015), symbol digit
substitution test (SDS), and the Stroop Color-Word Test (SCWT).
After six-month training, some patients in the training group

stopped training and tended to be followed up continuously (Fig. 1).
During the follow-up period, medications for dementia (cholinesterase
inhibitors or memantine) were not prescribed.
Our study received ethical approval from the Research Ethics
Committee, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong
University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. Informed consent was
obtained from all patients. The study was registered with Chinese Trial
[Registry.gov (Register number: ChiCTR-IPR-16008383).](http://Registry.gov)

2.2. MRI acquisition and processing

At baseline and 6-month, repeated magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) was performed for neuroimaging evaluation. High-resolution T1weighted fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGR) sequence was acquired on
a 3.0 Tesla MR system (GE Signa HDxt; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI)
equipped with an eight-channel phased array head coil at the department of radiology (sagittal slice orientation; matrix = 256 × 256; repetition time = 5.5 ms; echo time = 1.7 ms; inversion time = 450 ms;
flip angle = 12°; voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm[3]). Resting-state blood
oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI using echo planar imaging (EPI)
weighted sequence (210 functional images, sagittal slice orientation;
35/37/39 slices; slice thickness = 4.0 mm; matrix = 64 × 64; repetition time = 2000 ms; echo time = 30 ms; flip angle = 90°; voxel
size = 3.75 × 3.75 × 4 mm[3]) was also performed at baseline and 6months if patients consented.
Preprocessing procedures of BOLD included slice timing, realignment, co-registration, normalization by T1 unified segmentation using a
modified MATLAB toolbox “Data Processing & Analysis of Brain
Imaging (version 3.0)” (Yan et al., 2016). After exclusion cases due to
head motion (translation or rotation head motion parameters larger
than 2 mm or 2°), 34 patients (15 in the training group and 19 in the
control group) were qualified for further analysis.
We calculated mean fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (fALFF) from BOLD signals to represent individuals' regional
neural activities (Zou et al., 2008). Voxel based morphometry of gray
matter was also calculated as covariate volume.

2.3. Training

Cognitive training was carried out at patients' home online. Training
program is comprised of the following eight tasks.
Visual working memory task: In one session, patients were asked to
memorize several (2–8 cards, started from 2) playing cards (targets)
within some time (time (second) =2 × the number of targets). Then
they did a simple calculation, such as “4 + 6=” or “5–3=”. They
would be presented with another group of playing cards (probes) until
they calculated correctly. Then they needed to judge whether any card
(target) seen before was among the probes. The number of probes is
twice as many as targets. The difficulty level was self-adaptive. The
number of targets doubled (two successive correct responses), or remained (one incorrect response) or decreased (two or more successive
incorrect responses) in the next session.
30-second memory task: It is similar to visual working memory task,
except for the calculation process. Patients enjoyed 30-second music
and scenery pictures instead of calculating. Self-adaptation was identical to visual working memory task.
Episodic memory task: Pictures (1–4 pictures) depicting an event
(e.g. Miss Wang is doing physical exercise in the morning in the park)
were presented for a few seconds. Then patients enjoyed 30-second
music and scenery pictures as an interruption. After music, patients
were asked questions about the event (e.g. What is Miss Wang doing in
the morning at the park: doing exercise? fishing? sleeping?). Similarly,
the number of pictures doubled (two successive correct responses) or
remained (one incorrect response) or decreased (two or more successive
incorrect responses) in the next session.
Speed of calculation task: Flowers with arithmetic questions (e g


4 + 6 =? 5–3 =?, 6 × 5 =? 6÷3 =?) were moving downwards from
the top of the screen (one flower with one question on it). Patients were
asked to answer these questions with keyboard as soon as possible. If
the answer was correct, the flower (question) disappeared. If no correct
answer was given before the flower moved to the bottom of screen, the
flower stayed on the bottom. The task was over when the bottom line of
screen was fully occupied by the flowers. The speed of flowers gradually
increased during the task.
Visual search task: Patients performed a classic visual search task by
searching a letter “T” among “L”s. They were asked to choose “target
on” or “no target” as soon as possible (Horowitz and Wolfe, 1998).
Alertness task: In one trial, a red box was presented in the random
location as an alert for a while. After it disappeared, a golden coin was
presented in the identical location. The time between box disappearance and presentation of the coin randomly varied. Patients were
asked to keep alert when box presented and press the “Enter” key as
quickly as they saw the coin.
Mental rotation task: Two “R”s (identical or mirrored “R”) of different angle were presented. Patients were asked to judge whether the
two letters were the same or mirrored as soon as possible.
Image re-arrangement task: The procedure of several daily activities
(e.g. shopping, washing) was separated into six steps depicted by six
pictures. All pictures were randomly sequenced. Patients were asked to
re-arrange the pictures into a reasonable sequence based on their
knowledge.
Patients in the training group were asked to perform all these tasks
3–4 times (about 120–160 min training in total) per week for 6 months.
Their login information and training performance on the web server
were checked weekly, and telephone interview was used to make sure
all participants in the training group got equally amounts of training.

2.4. Statistical analyses

We used per-protocol sets in order to strictly estimate the immediate
and late effect of training. If patients were indicated cholinesterase
inhibitors or memantine, or they could not insist on training, their data
would be ruled out from analysis.
The differences of age, years of education, neuropsychological
score, gender, hypertension, and diabetes between two groups at
baseline were compared by the independent t-test or chi-square test.
We used mixed-effect regression model with maximum likelihood
estimation to compare changes of cognitive scores between two groups.
The interaction effect between time and group represented the training
effect. In the training group, linear regression was used to estimate the
relationship between the training duration and the outcomes.
We defined standardized change scores as changes between endpoint and baseline scores divided by standard deviation (SD) for all
patients combined. For comparison with other trials, we calculated
effect size by subtracting mean standardized change scores in the
control group from those in the training group (Barnes et al., 2009).
Significance of < 5% was used in all analyses, and SPSS 22 program
(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical data
analysis.
For the fMRI data analysis, a mixed model was also used to estimate
interaction between time and group. Standardized gray matter volumes
of the whole brain were used as covariates.
Regarding to multiple comparison correction, we used permutation
test (Winkler et al., 2016) with threshold-free cluster enhancement
(TFCE) to reach the best balance between family-wise error rate (under
5%) and test-retest reliability (Chen et al., 2018). In this way, the distribution of the maximum was used as reference, and the rank of a given
voxel in relation to that distribution was used to obtain p values. Significant voxels in the cerebral would be marked by BrainNet Viewer
(Xia et al., 2013).

3. Results

3.1. Clinical and cognitive results

A total of 141 MCI patients finished the 6-month follow-up. In the
training group, 78 patients completed the assessments at 6-month.
Among them, 3 patients (3.84%) converted to AD and 33 MCI patients
were continuously observed for another 12 months. In the control
group, 63 patients finished. Among them, 4 patients progressed to AD
(6.35%) and 30 MCI patients were followed up for another 12 months.
Dropout rate was higher in the control group (2.5% in the training
group and 21.25% in the control group). The main reason (10 patients
in 17) for dropout in the control group was that they contacted with
other physicians for medications.
The mean age of the population was 70.4 at baseline (SD 7.1), and
two groups were similar to each other (p = .1). Both groups were also
of similar level of education (p = .5), as well as hypertension and
diabetes. Global cognition assessed by MMSE was equivalent between
groups. Training group showed advantages in fluency, language and
visuospatial ability assessed by ACER, recall in CFT and symbol digit
substitution test (p < .05, Table 1). In the training group, the averaged
training duration was 122.8 min every week, ranged from 100.0 to
158.6 min. The relationship between training duration and the effect
size was found significant in the following tests: MMSE, ACER, ACER
attention, ACER memory, CFT recall and AVLT 20-min recall (Fig. 2).
After six months follow-up, significant beneficial effect of the
training was found for the primary outcome. The mean difference between groups in change of MMSE in the half year was 0.73 SD


(group×time interaction effect, p = .002). MMSE improved 0.23 SD in
the training group compared to −0.5 SD in the control group (Fig. 3,
Table 2).
We also found significant training effects of ACER attention
(p = .002) and memory (p = .006), as well as SCWT interference index
(p = .038) and CFT copy (p = .035). Effect size of verbal memory (5minute recall in AVLT) was marginally significant in favor of the
training group (p = .080, range from 0.07 to 0.73 SD) (Table 2).
However, effect size of ACER fluency tended to favor the control group
(p = .073, ranged from −0.68 to −0.02 SD). Other differences of
changes in secondary outcomes between the groups were not statistically significant.
Thirty-three patients in the training group and 30 patients in the
control group were observed for another 12 months. In this sub-population, we firstly found similar improvement in the training group (33
patients) at 6-month: MMSE (p < .001), attention in ACER
(p < .001), CFT copy (p = .05), SDS (p = .027), SCWT-color
(p = .013) and STT-B (p = .020). However, in the following 12 months,
all differences between the changes in two groups were not statistically
significant (Fig. 4).

3.2. fMRI results

The interaction effect (group×time) in mixed model analysis was
depicted in the Fig. 5. It represented the difference between changes of
two groups at two time points (Difference = (training group at
6 months-training group at baseline)−(control group at 6 months-control group at baseline)). In fALFF results, clusters of positive difference
were detected at bilateral temporal poles, insular lobes and left parahippocampal gyrus (Fig. 5, corrected voxel level: p < .05). Clusters
found in bilateral temporal and insular lobes merged, with total size of
643 voxels. No significantly negative difference was detected.

4. Discussion

In the trial, we estimated the effectiveness of the Chinese-version
computer-based cognitive training in MCI patients. Regarding global
cognitive function, we observed an effect size of 0.73 SD in MMSE and
0.31 SD in ACER in favor of the training group. MMSE decline in the
control group was about 1 point per 6-month. The Chinese-version
MMSE has been validated in China for > 20 years and its norm and
longitudinal changes in MCI patients are relatively more clear than
other cognitive tests. The only difference between the Chinses-version
MMSE and the original one is the phrase which should be repeated (“No
ifs, ands or buts”). It was replaced by a Chinese sentence. According to
MMSE studies in China, MMSE decreased by 0.6 to 2 per year in MCI
patients (Gao et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2006), which was consistent with
our data in the control group. Though effect size of ACER was not
statistically significant, it is similar in magnitude to other cognitive
training for normal aging (Lampit et al., 2014), MCI (Barnes et al.,
2009), and cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (Birks, 2006).
As for secondary outcomes, we observed effect sizes for attention,
memory, visuospatial configuration and executive function tests in
ACER consistently favored the training group. Attention test included
orientation (time and place), immediate memory, and successive calculation. Memory test in ACER had a relatively short interval before
recall, which was similar to 5-minute recall in AVLT. It is suggested that
our training tended to benefit short-term memory. In contrast, effect
size of verbal fluency test tended to favor the control condition. Since
the training program did not include verbal training, the result suggested the hypothesis that training program may have domain-specific
effects. The transfer effect observed in other studies was confined in
related abilities, such as visual working memory and spatial working
memory (Li et al., 2008), speed of processing and driving mobility (Ross
et al 2016) No transfer effect was observed between language and

other cognitive domains. Regarding to improvement of verbal fluency
test of the control group, more studies are needed to determine whether
the effect was due to random variation. In the subsample of patients
who tended to be followed up for another 12 months, similar effects on
global cognition, attention, executive function, and visuo-spatial tests
were found immediately after the end of training. Nevertheless, after
one-year follow up without training, effects were not significant. The
results were partially consistent with other training studies. In a
memory training study, training effect (working memory ability) and
transfer effect were found improved immediately after training.
Nevertheless, after one-year follow up, both effects were not significant


(Buschkuehl et al., 2008). Spatial working memory task also has effects
transferred to more demanding spatial tasks, with benefits lasting only
for 3 months (Li et al., 2008).
In the resting-state fMRI, fractional ALFF (fALFF) approach, the
ratio of the power spectrum of low-frequency (0.01–0.08 Hz) to that of
the entire frequency range, is suggested better sensitivity and specificity
in detecting spontaneous brain activities (Zou et al., 2008). MCI patients showed decreased fALFF mainly in the medial prefrontal cortex,
posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus and hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus, while there was increased activity in some temporal regions (Wang et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2014; Han et al., 2011).

In a cognitive interventional study for healthy older adults, ALFF in
the middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and anterior cerebellum lobe was enhanced, corresponding to improved memory and
social support (Yin et al., 2014). Working memory training for young
adults increased fALFF in the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex,


frontopolar area and medial prefrontal cortex (Takeuchi et al., 2017).
These results suggested training-induced spontaneous brain activities
during the resting state. In our study, clusters in the bilateral temporal
lobes and insular cortices were enhanced measured by fALFF, as well as
clusters in the bilateral hippocampus.

We only observed positive interaction effect, indicating positive
correlation between training and regional neural activity. The fMRI
results were partly consistent with neuropsychological outcomes immediately after training. We observed that attention, short-term
memory, visuospatial configuration, and executive function gained
from the training. Temporal poles were found as “semantic hub” of the
brain, and its neural codes were related with idiosyncratic patterns of
memory errors, as well as variation in true-memory performance
(Chadwick et al., 2016). Ventral regions of the temporal pole and parahippocampal gyri were also related to visual semantic representations
(Peelen and Caramazza, 2012). Besides, the integrity including bilateral
hippocampus and para-hippocampal gyri could enhance emotion in
memory processes (Kumfor et al., 2014).
The insular cortex has connections with the anterior cingulate
cortex, temporal pole, prefrontal cortex, frontal and parietal opercula,
visual association cortex, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex (Nagai
et al., 2007). Bilateral insular cortices and nearby angular gyri were
involved in various cognitive and mood processes, and its network with
hippocampus was related with attention (Loitfelder et al., 2012) and
visual cortex responses (Petro et al., 2017). Functional neuroimaging
studies have found insula hyper-activations for tasks including those
involving perception, intentional action, and consciousness (Gasquoine,
2014). It also demonstrated causal influences on all other frontal-cingulate-parietal regions, serving as a major causal control hub during
multisensory attention (Chen et al., 2015). The neural activation in
insular cortex may help to explain the benefit for visual and semantic
memory related tasks. Since insular cortex did not suffer injury in MCI
or early AD, it may also work as compensatory neural activities after
training.
Our study has limitation in the follow-up. MCI patients in the
training group may stop training if they suffer from more severe cognitive decline, and patients in the control group will also drop out and
turn to other medical help when their symptoms get severe. The attrition bias would obscure the interventional effect if per-protocol sets
were strictly adopted. In further studies, an intention-to-treat analysis
would help minimize the bias. In addition, further studies should determine the target population precisely and try to incorporate the
reason of dropout into final effect.


Beyond traditional cognitive stimulation, combined assessment and
training application by visual reality could be tried due to its more
convenience and high classification rate for MCI patients (Zygouris
et al., 2017; D et al., 2015). In addition, multidomain intervention, as
well as physiological stimulation such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, remains to be well investigated in clinical settings.

5. Conclusion

In summary, we designed the Chinese computer-based cognitive
training and found that it was effective for delaying cognitive decline in
elders with MCI. The effect was only observed immediately after
training and confined to trained domains. Functional MRI suggested
corresponding increased local neural activities at bilateral temporal
poles, insular cortices and hippocampus.
