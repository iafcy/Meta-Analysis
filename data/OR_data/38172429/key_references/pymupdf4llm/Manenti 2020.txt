Background: In recent years, the potential usefulness of cognitive training procedures
in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have received increased attention.

Objective: The main aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the face-to-face
cognitive virtual reality rehabilitation system (VRRS) and to compare it to that of face-toface cognitive treatment as usual for individuals with MCI. Moreover, we assessed the
possibility of prolonging the effects of treatment with a telerehabilitation system.

Methods: A total of 49 subjects with MCI were assigned to 1 of 3 study groups
in a randomized controlled trial design: (a) those who received face-to-face cognitive
VRRS (12 sessions of individualized cognitive rehabilitation over 4 weeks) followed by
telerehabilitation (36 sessions of home-based cognitive VRRS training, three sessions
for week); (b) those who received face-to-face cognitive VRRS followed by at-home
unstructured cognitive stimulation (36 sessions of home-based unstructured cognitive
stimulation, three sessions for week); and (c) those who received face-to-face cognitive
treatment as usual (12 sessions of face-to-face cognitive treatment as usual).

Results: An improvement in memory, language and visuo-constructional abilities was
observed after the end of face-to-face VRRS treatment compared to face-to-face
treatment as usual. The application of home-based cognitive VRRS telerehabilitation


-----

seems to induce more maintenance of the obtained gains than home-based
unstructured stimulation.

Discussion: The present study provides preliminary evidence in support of
individualized VRRS treatment and telerehabilitation delivery for cognitive rehabilitation
and should pave the way for future studies aiming at identifying optimal cognitive
treatment protocols in subjects with MCI.

## INTRODUCTION

In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of
telerehabilitation methods in patients with neurodegenerative
diseases (Cherney and van Vuuren, 2012; Cotelli et al., 2019).
Given the limited effectiveness of pharmacological treatments,
there is a critical need to develop novel interventions aimed at
preventing or delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) might represent a potential
target for intervention trials (Kidd, 2008; Hong et al., 2015;
Janoutova et al., 2015).
Traditional cognitive training involves intensive in-person
sessions that may not prove to be feasible and cost-effective in the
case of large-scale implementation. The average lifespan in the
world almost doubled during the 20th century and has resulted in
a large number of people living to old ages, causing an increased
risk of developing age-related diseases, disability and dementia
(Fratiglioni et al., 1999; Brown, 2015). In the coming years, the
growing demand and the need to contain the costs of health
care will dictate the need to reorganize the services dedicated
to people at risk of developing cognitive impairment by taking
advantage of technological developments (Bharucha et al., 2009;
Astell, 2019; Moyle, 2019). Telerehabilitation via information
and communication technologies (Brennan et al., 2011; Realdon
et al., 2016; Pitt et al., 2019) represents an innovative approach to
overcome the obstacles associated with face-to-face intervention.
Telerehabilitation technologies allow to provide services remotely
in patients’ homes or other environments, allowing access to
health care to patients living in rural settings or with mobility
difficulties (Brennan et al., 2002, 2009, 2011; Forducey et al.,
2003; Mashima and Doarn, 2008; Zampolini et al., 2008; Hailey
et al., 2011; Peretti et al., 2017). In addition, the telerehabilitation
modality offers the advantage of providing rehabilitation within
the natural environment of the patient’s home, making the
treatment more realistic and possibly more generalizable to the
person’s daily life (McCue et al., 2010).
Recent studies have shown that the application of
telerehabilitation methodology in individuals with physical
impairments, post-stroke participants and patients with
neurodegenerative diseases leads to clinical improvements that
are generally equal to those induced by conventional face-to-face
rehabilitation programs (Brennan et al., 2002; Rosen, 2004;
Poon et al., 2005; Mashima and Doarn, 2008; Kairy et al.,
2009; Cherney and van Vuuren, 2012; Jelcic et al., 2014;


Antonietti et al., 2016; Vermeij et al., 2016; Burton and
O’Connell, 2018; Isernia et al., 2019).
A recent systematic review showed the efficacy of
telerehabilitation on cognitive abilities in individuals with MCI
and in patients with neurodegenerative diseases associated with
cognitive impairment (Cotelli et al., 2019). MCI is a condition
associated with risk of progression to dementia, and represents
a well-suited target for prevention studies (Petersen et al., 1999,
2014; Petersen, 2004; Livingston et al., 2017). However, these
treatments are delivered in several ways and there is not a clinical
consensus about content-design of telerehabilitation. A fixed
schedule approach has proved to be effective in the treatment of
elderly people with high risk of conversion in dementia resulting
in a significant improvement in global cognitive functioning,
memory and processing speed (Lampit et al., 2014). In other
studies, participants were given the opportunity to choose free
among the activities available in each session of training (Medalia
and Freilich, 2008; Gooding et al., 2016). A third alternative
consisted in the user-centered approach, which customized
the choice of rehabilitative contents based on the performance
obtained by the individual to the set up tests implemented in
the software at the beginning of the rehabilitation path (Solana
et al., 2015; Vance et al., 2018). So far, the majority of studies
are feasibility or pilot studies with small-medium sample size
and are very heterogeneous in terms of intensity and duration
of treatment (Burdea et al., 2015; Espay et al., 2016; Dodakian
et al., 2017). For this reason, in the light of this ongoing deep
transformation of health care, it is of great relevance the effort
to harmonize intervention protocols and randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) are strongly needed to demonstrate the effectiveness
of these home-based technology-enhanced treatment protocols
with respect to the gold-standard, named the usual face-to-face
care (Linden et al., 2016; Fetta et al., 2017; Topol, 2019).
The main aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy
of the cognitive face-to-face virtual reality rehabilitation system
(VRRS) and to compare it to that of face-to-face cognitive
treatment as usual for subjects with MCI. We hypothesized
that the face-to-face VRRS system would ameliorate memory
and attentional abilities more than treatment as usual in
subjects with MCI.
Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that the implementation
of home-based treatment through the cognitive VRRS system
could induce long-term benefits, prolonging the beneficial effects
of face-to-face.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

Recruitment and treatment were conducted at the IRCCS Istituto
Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli of Brescia, the
IRCCS Centro Neurolesi Bonino-Pulejo, Messina, and the IRCCS
Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi Onlus of Milan, from April 2018
to February 2020 (see Figure 1).

## Study Design
This was a multicenter rater-blinded, active-controlled and
randomized study. The investigators and outcome assessors were


blinded to the type of treatment. Participants were randomized
into three groups: (a) those who received face-to-face cognitive
VRRS treatment followed by cognitive telerehabilitation
(clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS), where subjects received faceto-face cognitive VRRS treatment (clinic-VRRS) followed
by home-based VRRS treatment (Tele@H-VRRS); (b)
those who received face-to-face cognitive VRRS treatment
followed by at-home unstructured cognitive stimulation
(clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS), where subjects received
clinic-VRRS treatment followed by at-home unstructured
cognitive stimulation (Tele@H-UCS); and (c) those who


-----

received face-to-face cognitive treatment as usual (clinicTAU), where participants received only face-to-face cognitive
conventional rehabilitation.
The treatment group assigned to each patient was obtained
by stratified randomization according to age and his/her
performance in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)
(Folstein et al., 1975). Stratified randomization is achieved by
generating a separate block for each combination of covariates,
and participants are assigned to the appropriate block of
covariates by a researcher blinded to the study aims. Details of
the allocated group were given on cards contained in sequentially
numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes.
The study protocol was executed in its entirety with no
significant changes.
This study was approved by the local ethics committees
and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki and reported according to CONSORT
guidelines (Boutron et al., 2008; Boutron et al., 2017).
The trial was registered at [clinicaltrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) (NCT
number: NCT03486704).
All participants were made fully aware of the aims of the
research, and written informed consent was obtained from all
subjects from the local center.

## Participants
Forty-nine older adults fulfilling the Petersen criteria for MCI
(Petersen, 2011) were recruited. All participants were living
independently in the community at the time of their baseline
evaluation and were followed up annually during at least 2 years
before recruitment in the present study.
Since no previous studies have investigated cognitive
VRRS treatment effects on memory outcome, the sample size
calculation was based on a prior study on patients with AD (Jelcic
et al., 2014), with an effect size of 0.85 (Cohen’s d) for the MMSE
score (Folstein et al., 1975) improvement after telerehabilitation
treatment, a significance level (α) of 0.05 and a power (1-β) = 80

[two-tailed independent t-test)]. The estimated sample size was
twelve participants for each group.
All the participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision
and were characterized by the following: (a) memory complaints;
(b) preservation of general cognitive functioning documented by
MMSE scores from 24 to 30 (Folstein et al., 1975); (c) age over
65 years; (d) global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of
0.5 (Morris, 1997); (e) preservation of functional activities; (f)
absence of criteria for a diagnosis of dementia according to DSMV (American Psychiatric Association, 2014); and (g) absence of
mood and anxiety disorders. Moreover, before inclusion in the
cognitive training protocol, the availability and motivation of
subjects to participate consecutively in the protocol for its entire
duration and the presence of a caregiver for the completion of
questionnaires at all time assessments were verified.
The following stringent exclusion criteria were applied:
(a) other prior or current neurological or major psychiatric
disorders; (b) visual perception disorder and/or hearing loss;
(c) history of traumatic brain injury, brain tumor or stroke;
and (d) history of alcohol abuse. None of the participants had
participated in cognitive training protocols within the year before


enrollment or during the entire duration of the present study
(from baseline to the last follow-up assessment).

## Assessment Procedures
Evaluation Timeline
The evaluations were carried out for all groups at baseline
(T0), at the end of face-to-face treatment (T1, 1 month from
baseline), and after 4 months (T2) and 7 months (T3) from
baseline. The T2 follow-up visit corresponded to the end of
the at-home treatment for the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS
and clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS groups. All the assessments
were carried out by expert neuropsychologists blinded to the
treatment allocation of the participants. Since the participants
were aware of the type of intervention received, they were advised
not to declare the type of treatment carried out during the
post-treatment and follow-up evaluations, making the treatment
conditions unknown to the clinical psychologist who conducted
the evaluations.
A comprehensive clinical, functional and neuropsychological
evaluation was performed at all visits (T0, T1, T2, and
T3). During baseline assessment, family history of dementia,
record of medical events, current medication and complete
neurologic examination results were recorded and the CDR scale
(Morris, 1997) and the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire
(CRIq) (Nucci et al., 2012) were completed. In addition, the
participants in the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS and clinicVRRS + Tele@H-UCS groups underwent a computerized
cognitive assessment and an assessment of system usability.

Clinical and Functional Assessment
The evaluation of subjective memory complaints was conducted
using the 20-item version (range: 20–180) of the Everyday
Memory Questionnaire (Sunderland et al., 1986; Calabria et al.,
2011). Functional abilities were evaluated using basic (BADL) and
instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) scales (Katz, 1983;
Lawton and Brody, 1988). Depression was assessed with the 30item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (Yesavage
et al., 1982), whereas neuropsychiatric symptoms were recorded
using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (Cummings et al.,
1994; Binetti et al., 1998). Finally, quality of life was recorded
using the Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QOL-AD) scale
(Bianchetti et al., 2017).

Neuropsychological Assessment
In addition to clinical and functional assessments, all participants
were tested at each visit with a standardized neuropsychological
battery. Cognitive tests were applied to assess a broad range
of cognitive abilities commonly affected by MCI. The battery
took approximately 90 min and included the MMSE (Folstein
et al., 1975) for the assessment of global cognition; Raven’s
Colored Progressive Matrices for non-verbal reasoning (Basso
et al., 1987); verbal fluency (phonemic, FPL; and semantic,
FPC) (Novelli et al., 1986) and action and object naming
subtests from the battery for the assessment of aphasic
disorders (BADA, Miceli et al., 1994) for language production;
the Rey–Osterrieth complex figure test-copy (Caffarra et al.,
2002) and the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) (Shulman et al.,


-----

1993) for visuo-constructional abilities; the Trail Making
Test (TMT) part A and part B (Giovagnoli et al., 1996;
Siciliano et al., 2019) for attention functions; and the Rey
Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), immediate and delayed
recall (Carlesimo et al., 1996), the Free and Cued Selective
Reminding Test (FCSRT) (Frasson et al., 2011) and the Rey–
Osterrieth complex figure test-recall (Caffarra et al., 2002) for
episodic memory. All the tests were administered and scored
according to standard procedures (Lezak et al., 2012) (see
**Tables 3, 4 for details).**

Computerized Cognitive Tasks
In the case of the participants who received face-to-face
VRRS treatment (the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS and clinicVRRS + Tele@H-UCS groups), the performances achieved
during VRRS treatment were further analyzed to assess memory,
visuospatial abilities, attention and executive functions. In
particular, we recorded the performance of each patient in
the first clinic-VRRS session (as the baseline score, T0), and
then we registered the participants’ performances obtained
during the last clinic-VRRS session as the post-treatment rating
(T1). Moreover, participants underwent computerized cognitive
assessment during follow-up assessments (T2, T3) to analyze
long-term effects.

TABLE 1 | Face to face cognitive VRRS treatment (clinic-VRRS).


Assessment of System Usability
To record subjective assessments of the clinic-VRRS, we
administered the System Usability Scale (SUS) (Brooke, 1996;
Bangor et al., 2008, 2009; Peres et al., 2013) to all the
subjects who received clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS and
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS at T1. Moreover, we recorded
the SUS scores at T2 in the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS
group to assess cognitive telerehabilitation usability (Tele@HVRRS usability). The SUS is a 10-item, five-point Likert scale
(1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). The scoring
instructions described by Brooke (35) were considered. The final
score ranges from 10 to 100.

Cognitive Rehabilitation Procedures
The cognitive rehabilitation protocol was delivered to all
participants according to the corresponding experimental group.

Face-to-Face Cognitive VRRS Treatment
(Clinic-VRRS)
Participants assigned to the clinic-VRRS group received twelve
60-min sessions of individualized cognitive rehabilitation using
VRRS[1] in the clinic with a user-centered approach over

10 min


4 weeks. Subjects were seated in front of a computer screen
in a quiet room.
Face-to-face cognitive VRRS treatment included twelve
exercises designed to enhance memory, visuospatial abilities,
attention and executive functions (listed in Table 1). In each
treatment session, the participant worked with six exercises,
10 min each, so that each exercise was completed six times
over the twelve clinic-VRRS sessions. The subject was asked to
continue to perform each task until the end of the set time. The
therapist suggested to the participant some strategies aiming to
improve performance in all the treatment sessions except for
the first and last sessions. At the end of each training session,
subjects received feedback on their performances, and a detailed
report of the results was made available to the therapist, allowing
the monitoring of progress over time. Clinical VRRS treatment
was tailored to the patient’s baseline characteristics through
a pre-training session. The starting level and the number of
trials were adjusted according to the subject’s performance level
using an adaptive staircase procedure. Progress was continuously
monitored, and the exercises adaptively progressed in difficulty.

Face-to-Face Cognitive Treatment as Usual
(Clinic-TAU)
Participants assigned to the clinic-TAU group received twelve
60-min sessions of group cognitive stimulation in the clinic.
During these group sessions, which were led by mental health


professionals, reality orientation therapy, reminiscence therapy,
paper and pencil exercises and metacognitive training aiming to
learn cognitive strategies and to use external aids were proposed.
At the end of this face-to-face treatment, participants were
requested not to perform any cognitive activity until the
conclusion of the entire protocol.

Home-Based Cognitive VRRS Treatment
(Tele@H-VRRS)
The participants assigned to the Tele@H-VRRS group received,
after the end of face-to-face treatment, thirty-six 60-min sessions
of home-based cognitive VRRS treatment (see “text footnote
1”), three sessions for week over 3 months. Twelve exercises
designed to enhance memory, visuospatial abilities, attention
and executive functions, different from those used in face-toface VRRS training, were selected (listed in Table 2). In each
treatment session, a participant worked with six exercises, 10 min
each, task difficulty adaptively progressed, and the performances
were continuously monitored by the therapist. The subject
was asked to continue to perform each task until the end
of the set time.
The VRRS system has telerehabilitation functionalities,
allowing the use of the same functionalities applied in
the face-to-face treatment. For the at-home treatment, each
participant received a home-based kit including a tablet that
allowed access to a daily individualized training program,


-----

a detailed VRRS tablet manual, an exercise instructions
booklet and a participant diary. Before beginning the homebased treatment, the therapist downloaded all 36 sessions
of the appropriate individualized cognitive training exercise
on the patient’s tablet and assisted the participants and
their caregivers at first access to familiarize them with
the technological device. During home-based treatment, the
therapist provided continuous assistance for technical difficulties
and individualized cognitive training exercises were adjusted by
the therapist once a week.

Home-Based Unstructured Cognitive Stimulation
(Tele@H-UCS)
Subjects assigned to the Tele@H-UCS group were requested
to work on detailed activities 60 min a day, three times
a week (36 sessions in total) over 12 weeks after the end
of face-to-face treatment. They received, from the therapist,
an instructions booklet and a participant diary. Conventional
instruments, such as paper and pencil exercises, creative
manual activities, reading newspapers and magazines, watching
documentaries, crosswords and sudoku, were suggested. Each
participant was requested to compile a detailed diary reporting
the performed activities.

## Outcomes
Primary outcome measures were the changes in two tasks of
verbal episodic memory: (a) the RAVLT, immediate and delayed
recall; and (b) the FCSRT.
The secondary outcomes included quality of life measures,
subjective memory complaints and neuropsychological measures
evaluating memory, language, attention and visuo-constructional
functions. The choice of outcomes was based on previous
literature findings and on predefined hypotheses of investigation.
Inference on them was performed considering each outcome
singularly (i.e., not simultaneous inference was done on all
outcome, thus no multiple comparison was needed to compare
outcomes results each other (see e.g., Proschan and Follmann,
1995; Bender and Lange, 2001).

## Statistical Analysis
Summary statistics are expressed as means and standard
deviations. Comparisons of socio-demographic features between
groups were evaluated by parametric (t-tests) or corresponding
non-parametric (Mann–Whitney) tests. Variable distribution was
inspected through histograms and the use of the Kolmogorov–
Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk tests. Consistent with the type of
variable distribution (Gaussian, Poisson or Gamma), generalized
linear mixed models (GLMMs) were performed to evaluate
score differences across time points and between groups. In
detail, the first series of GLMMs was applied to compare
two groups (clinic-TAU vs. clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS
together with clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS) across two time
points (baseline and post-treatment). Subsequently, GLMMs
were performed to compare the three subject groups across
four time points (baseline, post-treatment, 4-month followup, and 7-month follow-up). Different test scores were used
as dependent variables (one for each model), and the effects


(time, group and time × group) were considered independent
variables. Sequential Sidak correction was used for the evaluation
of post hoc.
Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Statistical analyses
were carried out by using SPSS 25.0. Graphs were generated using
R software (R Core Team, 2013).

## RESULTS

A total of 79 subjects were evaluated for inclusion in this study.
Ultimately, 30 subjects were excluded (27 subjects did not meet
the inclusion criteria, and 3 subjects declined to participate),
whereas 49 subjects were deemed eligible for participation.
These 49 subjects were randomized into the three
experimental groups: 18 participants were allocated to the
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS group, 14 subjects to the
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS group and 17 participants to the
clinic-TAU group. All the participants completed the baseline
(T0), post-treatment (T1) and follow-up (T2 and T3) evaluations
(see Figure 1-Flowchart).
Adherence to treatment was indexed by the number
of sessions completed for each participant. Concerning the
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS group, all 18 participants
completed the 12 sessions of face-to-face VRRS treatment, 6
participants completed all 36 sessions of at-home VRRS training,
whereas all other subjects completed more than 70% of the
telerehabilitation sessions. Moreover, all 14 participants in the
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS group completed the 12 sessions
of face-to-face VRRS treatment, 7 subjects completed the 36
sessions of at-home unstructured cognitive stimulation, and
the other subjects completed more than 70% of the at-home
unstructured cognitive stimulation sessions. Finally, 8 subjects
in the clinic-TAU group completed the 12 sessions, whereas
all the other subjects completed more than 70% of the usual
treatment sessions.

## Participants
We enrolled 49 patients with MCI, 42 (86%) amnestic MCI
and 7 (14%) non-amnestic MCI participants. In particular, the
current sample included: (i) 20 amnestic single domain MCI
(aMCI-s); (ii) 22 amnestic multiple domain MCI (aMCI-m); 10
of them showed an additional deficit in visuo-constructional
functions, 2 in attention, 3 in language, 4 in attention and visuoconstructional functions and 1 in attention and language; (iii)
6 non-amnestic single domain MCI (naMCI-s), presence of a
disability in another cognitive area (1 of them showed deficit in
language, 3 in visuo-constructional functions and 2 in attention
abilities), with normal memory; and (iv) 1 non-amnestic multiple
domain MCI (naMCI-m), with disabilities in attention and visuoconstructional functions, with normal memory.
The mean age of the participants was 76.5 years (SD = 4.2), the
mean number of years of education was 10.7 years (SD = 4.4), and
24 participants (49.0%) were male. The clinic-VRRS + Tele@HVRRS group included 13 male and 5 female participants (age:
mean, 75.3 years, SD: 3.3; education: 11.8 years, SD 4.8); the
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS group included 4 male and 10


-----

female participants (age: mean, 76.3 years, SD: 4.9; education:
10.5 years, SD 4.8); and the clinic-TAU group included 7 male and
10 female participants (age: mean, 78.1 years, SD: 4.1; education:
9.8 years, SD 3.7).
The three groups did not differ regarding age (p = 0.142) or
education (p = 0.405), but there was a significant difference in sex
(p = 0.036). Descriptive statistics of all clinical features of the three
groups of patients, measured at the four time points, are reported
in Table 3.

## Face-to-Face Cognitive Virtual Reality Rehabilitation System vs. Face-to-Face Cognitive Treatment as Usual
Our first aim was to evaluate the efficacy of the face-to-face
VRRS (clinic-VRRS) and to compare it to that of cognitive
treatment as usual (clinic-TAU). For this purpose, we considered
two groups of subjects: those who received VRRS (i.e., the
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS and clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS
groups) and those who received treatment as usual (i.e., the clinicTAU group), and we compared their scores at the first two time
points (baseline, T0; and after face-to-face treatment, T1).
We performed different GLMMs, one for each outcome,
with time (two time points), group (two treatments) and their
interaction as independent variables, to verify whether the two
treatments had different effects on the outcomes. The results are
shown in Table 4 (first columns).
The performances of the two groups at the two time points
were significantly different for the FCSRT IFR, FPC and CDT
(p-value of the interaction term equal to 0.010, 0.024, and 0.010,
respectively). Moreover, for the TMT A, there was a trend toward
significance (p = 0.058).
All the resulting significant outcomes are presented in
**Figure 2. In particular, the FCSRT IFR, CDT and TMT A**
scores improved only after clinic-VRRS (FCSRT IFR: p < 0.001;
CDT: p < 0.001; TMT A: p = 0.002). Although in TMT A
and CDT scores a significant difference was observed between
the two groups at baseline assessment, an improvement in
these tests could be recorded exclusively in clinic-VRRS group.
Regarding the FPC, the clinic-VRRS group showed an increase
from T0 to T1, whereas the clinic-TAU group showed worse FPC
performance, inducing a significant time × group interaction
(although the changes within groups did not reach significance).
Thus, by combining the information provided by the models and
figures, we showed that the clinic-VRRS was more efficient than
clinic-TAU, improving memory (FCSRT IFR), language (FPC),
attention (TMT A) and visuo-constructional abilities (CDT).

## Home-Based VRRS Rehabilitation (Tele@H-VRRS) vs. Home-Based Unstructured Cognitive Stimulation (Tele@H-UCS) vs. No Additional Treatment
After the first month, the participants who received clinicVRRS were divided into two subgroups in which cognitive
telerehabilitation and unstructured cognitive stimulation were


provided, while those who received usual care did not
receive any additional treatment during the following months.
Our second aim was to assess whether the telerehabilitation
VRRS system could extend the beneficial effects of face-toface VRRS treatment.
To verify this hypothesis, different GLMMs were
performed (one for each outcome) using time (four time
points), group (three groups) and their interaction as
independent variables. The results of the models are shown
in Table 4 (last columns).
Regarding the neuropsychological assessment, the outcome
that behaved in a significantly different way in the three
groups over time was the FCSRT IFR. As reported earlier,
the FCSRT IFR showed an improvement from T0 to T1
in the clinic-VRRS group. By splitting the clinic-VRRS
group into two subgroups, this improvement significantly
decreased after the end of face-to-face treatment in the clinicVRRS + Tele@H-UCS group (T1 vs. T2 p = 0.025; T1
vs. T3 p = 0.003), whereas no strong evidence of changes
in the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS group was recorded
(T1 vs. T2 p = 0.055; T1 vs. T3 p = 0.084). Although
the mean changes from T1 to T2 were similar in clinicVRRS + Tele@H-UCS and in clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS
groups, different statistical significance were mainly driven by
difference in variability (standard deviations) recorded in the
two experimental groups. As stated above, the clinic-TAU group
did not show any significant modification across all time points
(see Table 4).

## Computerized Cognitive Tasks
Different GLMMs were performed (Table 5), and it followed
that the two groups were different, across time, in the two
tasks “Complete the logic relationship” and “Safe openingforward” (interaction term p-values equal to 0.007 and 0.016,
respectively). For the first task, the performance of subjects
was different at all time points in the two groups (Figure 3).
_Post hoc analysis showed that there was a different trend in the_
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS and clinic-VRRS + Tele@HUCS groups, with very similar scores at T1 (p = 0.825)
and higher scores in the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS
group than in the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS group
at both follow-up visits (T2: p = 0.033; T3: p = 0.042).
For the safe opening-forward task, the score differed
significantly over time between the two groups: only the
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS group showed an improvement
from T0 and T1 (p = 0.017) and worsening from T1 and T2
(p = 0.044).

## System Usability Scale
Interestingly, the SUS, administered at T1 to the two groups who
received clinic-VRRS, showed good usability performance of the
clinic-VRRS system (67.8, SD 11.6), and the SUS scores obtained
at T2 in the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS group, which received
home-based telerehabilitation from T1 and T2, highlighted good
usability performance from the VRRS telerehabilitation system
(69.6, SD 8.8) (Bangor et al., 2008).

## DISCUSSION

In recent years, the potential usefulness of cognitive training in
normal aging and MCI has received increased attention (Brown,
2015; Vannini et al., 2017). Recent meta-analyses and reviews
have reported that non-pharmacological cognitive interventions
are effective in maintaining cognitive function in high-risk older
adults (Kidd, 2008; Li et al., 2011, 2014, 2017; Hong et al., 2015;
Janoutova et al., 2015; Sherman et al., 2017; Yao et al., 2020).


Different strategies, including stimulation restorative
cognitive training, compensatory cognitive training and
multicomponent training, have been used to reduce cognitive
difficulties in subjects with MCI when assessing different
outcomes (for review see Li et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2015;
Sherman et al., 2017).
The main purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy
of the face-to-face cognitive VRRS and to compare it to that of
face-to-face cognitive treatment as usual for subjects with MCI.

Specifically, we hypothesized that face-to-face cognitive VRRS
treatment may lead to an improvement in cognitive functions,
that is, memory and attentional abilities, compared with face-toface cognitive treatment as usual.
Moreover, we assessed whether an innovative cognitive
telerehabilitation program could induce long-term
cognitive benefits.
To address these questions, we compared the effects of faceto-face cognitive VRRS followed by cognitive telerehabilitation
(clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS), face-to-face cognitive VRRS
followed by at-home unstructured cognitive stimulation (clinicVRRS + Tele@H-UCS), and face-to-face cognitive rehabilitation
program as usual (clinic-TAU) on cognition in patients with MCI.
Overall, high rates of participant agreement, recruitment and
treatment adherence supported the feasibility of both face-toface and telerehabilitation interventions. Moreover, the analyses
on system usability evidenced good usability of clinic-VRRS
and Tele@H-VRRS.
The current findings show a significant improvement in
memory, language and visuo-constructional abilities after the
end of face-to-face cognitive VRRS treatment compared to faceto-face cognitive treatment as usual. Our findings are in line
with previous studies that described the usefulness of face-toface virtual reality rehabilitation protocols aimed at improving
memory and executive functioning in older participants with
mild cognitive difficulties (Liao et al., 2019; Moreno et al.,
2019; Tuena et al., 2020) as well as previous studies of effective
cognitive treatments to prevent and slow the progression of MCI
(Belleville, 2008).
Regarding at-home treatment, we found that cognitive
VRRS telerehabilitation has comparable effects to conventional
rehabilitation in improving cognitive abilities in patients with
neurodegenerative diseases. We evidenced positive effects of
VRRS telerehabilitation interventions, generally comparable
with those cognitive unstructured home-based intervention.
This comparable effect may be related to the modalities in
which the VRRS intervention was delivered: a computerized
cognitive training modality without a real interaction and
feedback between patient and therapist. The synchronous (in
which patient and therapist perform exercises in real time) or


asynchronous (in which patient and therapist do not interact
in real time) interactions, and the type of monitoring feedback,
i.e., on line (during the intervention) or off line (delayed),
are key components that may influence the efficacy of the
telerehabilitation and have thus been considered (Di Tella et al.,
2019) in future studies. Importantly, clinic-VRRS + Tele@HVRRS group showed greater maintenance of treatment gains
in episodic memory (i.e., FCSRT). Moreover, participants in
the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS group exhibited significant
intervention-related improvements in executive functions as
assessed by computerized cognitive tasks, with maintenance of
gains at the 7-month follow-up. Our results might be related
to patient’s engagement and adherence in a telerehabilitation
design involving asynchronous therapist-patient interactions
(Matamala-Gomez et al., 2020).
The available evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions
on the effects of different interventions on functional activities
or quality of life. Further, well-designed studies investigating the
efficacy of cognitive telerehabilitation are necessary.
We acknowledge that our study has some limitations. First,
given our relatively small sample size, the recorded findings
should be confirmed in larger samples to reach a firm conclusion.
A larger sample size would make it possible to take into
account in the analyses individual variables such as age, sex and
gender. Furthermore, the adoption of longer follow-up visits in
future studies would better highlight the duration of the longterm effects induced by the applied treatments. Finally, in the
present study some intergroup variabilities in cognitive scores
are recorded and the use of a crossover design could be used in
future studies in order to avoid problems of comparability of the
experimental groups with regard to confounding characteristics.
Notwithstanding this, our study provides preliminary
evidence in support of individualized VRRS treatment, and
telerehabilitation delivery for cognitive rehabilitation is quite
encouraging and should pave the way for future studies aiming
at identifying optimal treatment protocols in subjects with MCI.
This research supports the feasibility and benefits of cognitive
rehabilitation provided by telerehabilitation systems. This may
be particularly important for subjects with limited access to
therapy due to geographical distance, transport difficulties


-----

or a lack of local services. The recent COVID-19 emergency
has clearly indicated the importance of remote delivery
of cognitive rehabilitation to support ongoing rehabilitation
services and guarantee continuity of care to subjects with
cognitive impairment.
