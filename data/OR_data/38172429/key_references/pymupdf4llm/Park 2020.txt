ABSTRACT

Background: To date, there is a controversy on effects of cognitive intervention to maintain or improve
hippocampal function for older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Objective: The main objective of this study was to exam effects of virtual reality-based spatial cognitive training
(VR-SCT) using VR on hippocampal function of older adults with MCI.

Method: Fifty-six older adults with MCI were randomly allocated to the experimental group (EG) that received
the VR-SCT or the waitlist control group (CG) for a total of 24 sessions. To investigate effects of the VR-SCT
on spatial cognition and episodic memory, the Weschsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Block Design Test
(WAIS-BDT) and the Seoul Verbal Learning Test (SVLT) were used.

Results: During the sessions, the training performances gradually increased ( p < .001). After the intervention,
the EG showed significant greater improvements in the WAIS-BDT ( p < .001, η[2] = .667) and recall of the
SVLT ( p < .05, η[2] =.094) compared to the CG but in recognition of the SVLT ( p > .05, η[2] =.001).

Conclusion: These results suggest that the VR-SCT might be clinically beneficial to enhance spatial cognition
and episodic memory of older adults with MCI.

Key words: spatial cognition, navigation, virtual reality, cognitive impairment, hippocampus


### Introduction

To date, cognitive intervention used for delaying
cognitive declines or maintaining cognitive function
for patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in the
clinic has been found to be ineffective (Mehta et al.,
2017). The main reason is that it is difficult to
distinguish early stage of AD from healthy aging
and that AD is already in progress at the time of
intervention, thus limiting efficacy of the intervention (Metha et al., 2017).
Since early intervention of AD has gained a lot of
attention, interests in intervention from the stage of
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the early clinical
stage of AD, have increased (Roberts et al., 2009;
Park and Heo, 2017). Similar to AD, an atrophy in
hippocampus is one hallmark of MCI. It induces
declines in spatial cognition and episodic memory
(Plancher et al., 2012).

Accordingly, hippocampal function training would
be clinically useful way to improve spatial cognition
and episodic memory in people with MCI (Braak and
Del Tredici, 2015). Many studies have provided evidence supporting that spatial cognitive training (SCT)
could increase gray matter in hippocampus (Maguire
et al., 2006; Boyke et al., 2008). Previous studies have
largely focused on spatial cognition for training older
adults with MCI (Lövdén et al., 2012; Migo et al.,
2016; Howett et al., 2019). In previous studies, visual
stimuli consisting of several pictures or shapes have
been serially presented in a grid on a computer screen
at different locations. Subjects are then asked to memorize locations of these pictures (Hayes et al., 2004;
Kessels et al., 2007). These two dimension-based
SCT has been identified to be effective in improving
spatial cognition (Gaunet et al., 2001; Meneghetti
et al., 2016). However, performances on SCT in
two dimensions are generally different from requirements for everyday life, thus inducing low ecological
validity of the training. To generalize training’s effect
to subjects’ daily life, SCT needs to be implemented
in three dimensions (Farias et al., 2003; Schultheis
et al., 2002).


-----

Therefore, recent studies have implemented SCT
using virtual reality (VR) that mimics real environment as closely as possible for high ecological validity
(Lövdén et al., 2012; Howett et al., 2019). In these
studies, subjects are instructed to move to goals in a
virtual maze during training sessions. They are then
presented the task of moving to one point that subjects have previously visited by traversing the same
route they have learned during the training. These
spatial cognitive tasks could be solved only by using
egocentric navigation strategy with a body-centered
viewpoint (Zhong et al., 2018). However, several
neuroimaging studies have indicated that activation
in hippocampus corresponds to allocentric navigation rather than egocentric navigation (Colombo
et al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2018). Indeed, several
studies on factors that differentiate older adults with
MCI from healthy older adults have indicated that
allocentric spatial cognition is the most powerful
predictive factor (Plancher et al., 2012; Howett
et al., 2019).
Taken together, to improve hippocampal function of patients with MCI, allocentric SCT needs to
be carried out. Therefore, the objective of this study
was to investigate effects of 8 weeks of allocentric
SCT on hippocampal function of patients with
MCI. To assess hippocampal function, both spatial
cognition and episodic memory were evaluated. The
author hypothesized that allocentric SCT could be
effective in improving hippocampal function.

### Methods

Design
This study had a single-blind randomized controlled
trial design. Subjects were randomly allocated to the
experimental group (EG) or the control group (CG)
using a random number generated with MATLAB
(2012b; MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). For
the EG, VR-based SCT (VR-SCT) was performed.
Waitlist CG participated in the same training as did
the EG after the study.
An occupational therapist with 6 years of clinical
experience was blinded to group allocation and
conducted outcome measures. This study was
implemented for 8 weeks. Outcome measures were
implemented before and after the 8-week intervention. This study was registered at the Thai Clinical
Trials Registry ID: TCTR20191020002. All subjects
provided informed consent before participating in
the present study according to the Declaration of
Helsinki (2004).

Subjects
Older adults over 60 years old with amnestic MCI
were recruited from local senior centers in Seoul and


Asan, South Korea. Amnestic MCI was defined
according to a previous study (Petersen, 2004).
Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) subjective
memory complaint, (b) objective memory impairment
defined by score on the Korean version of California
Verbal Learning Test, (c) intact global cognitive
function as confirmed by score on the Korean
version of the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE-K) ≥ 24, and (d) intact activities of daily
living as identified by score on Seoul instrumental
activities of daily living score ≤ 7. Exclusion criteria
were as follows: (a) dementia diagnosed by physicians, (b) presence of neurological or psychiatric
disorders such as stroke and schizophrenia, (c) moderate to severe depressive symptom as determined by
score on the Beck Depression Scale, (d) presence of
auditory or visual impairments, and (e) participation
in any program to improve cognitive function within
3 months.
The number of subjects was calculated using
G*Power (Informer Technologies, Dusseldorf,
Germany) (Faul et al., 2007). According to a
previous study (Savulich et al., 2017), the effect
size (ES) was set at 0.84, the α error at a probability
of 0.05, and the power at 0.90. A minimum of
25 subjects was required for each group.

Intervention
VR-SCT, a kind of spatial cognitive task designed
to improve spatial memory, was implemented by an
occupational therapist with 7 years of clinical experience. VR-SCT consisted a total of 24 sessions
(45 minutes a session, 3 days a week for 8 weeks).
This program developed using the Unity game engine
was run by using a desktop computer. Subjects in the
EG used a joystick to freely move (forward, backward, turn left, or turn right) in a VR environment.
Those in the EG were presented an opportunity to
undergo two sessions in an open arena environment,
allowing subjects in the EG to familiarize themselves
with the environment and the control of the joystick
until subjects became familiar with them enough.
Subsequently, those in the EG were given training
sessions. During training sessions, subjects in the EG
were immersed in an environment with boundary
cues consisting of rocks and ocean (Figure 1A).
Subjects’ initial location was randomized in the
environment, and then they were asked to look
around. There was a gem at a certain point in the
environment where subjects were instructed to
move toward. Once subjects got the gem, another
gem was located again at a different location from the
previous gem. They were instructed to move to get
the new gem, resulting in subjects got each gem in
two different locations. Only one gem was shown at a
time, and each gem would disappear after subjects

reached it. After getting the second gem, a visual
instruction on the computer screen instructing
subjects to walk back to their initial location was
projected (Figure 1B). After subjects moved to the
estimated initial location, they were asked to press a
button on the joystick. In other words, subjects had
to estimate their initial location with allocentric
navigation strategy using boundary cues.
Every performance in training sessions was
recorded using Euclidean distance between estimated and actual initial locations. If the distance
was within 1 m, a feedback was provided “good
job,” whereas if the distance were out of 1 m, a
feedback was presented “better next time.” During
these sessions, no local landmarks were presented
near gems or the initial location, so it would not be a
clue to remember the location within boundary,
resulting in excluding compensatory navigation
strategies. Three minutes of rest time was provided
to minimize their fatigue after 15 minutes of training. Consequently, none of these subjects showed
adverse effects when using the computer during
these sessions.

Measurement
Two neuropsychological assessments were used as
outcome measures before and after the intervention
to evaluate spatial cognition and episodic memory.


The blinded assessor conducted all assessments in a
fixed order. Spatial cognition was measured using
the Weschsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Block
Design Test (WAIS-BDT). It involves a task of
arranging colored nine blocks to replicate 10 patterns
within 120 seconds in order of ascending difficulty.
Its score ranges from 0 to 48, with higher scores
meaning better spatial cognition (Wechsler, 1981).
The Seoul Verbal Learning Test (SVLT), standardized with 12 words in three semantic categories
Korean people widely use in everyday life, was used
to assess episodic memory. A subject was asked to
listen to 12 words at interval of 2 seconds and repeat
them immediately three times. After 20 minutes, a
subject was encouraged to recall the same words
again regardless of the order of words. At the end of
the test, a recognition test was implemented using
24 words consisting the previous words and new
words that were never presented. In the recognition
test, a subject was asked whether or not each word
was presented. A score of 1 was allocated for correct
response. Thus, the recall and the recognition test
had total scores of 12 and 24, respectively (Kang and
Na, 2003).

Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using SPSS version 25.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To confirm the normal

distribution of all outcome measures, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was conducted. Means and
standard deviations for subject characteristics of
the two groups were calculated. Independentsample t-test and chi-square test were used to investigate general characteristics of subjects between the
two groups. After the 8-week intervention, to compare distance error of the spatial cognitive task during
each session, a repeated one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) and the Bonferroni method as a post hoc
analysis were used. To compare outcomes between
the two groups, a repeated two-way ANOVA was
performed with time (pre- and post-intervention) as
within-group variable and intervention as betweensubject variable. The ES of each intervention group
was calculated using partial η[2] (Cohen, 1988). A
statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05.

### Results

Subject characteristics
A total of 56 elderly people with cognitive impairment
were selected from 172 elderly people in local senior
centers. Out of 172, 56 were finally selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Figure 1).


Subjects were then randomly allocated to two groups
(28 subjects per group). There were no significant
differences in general characteristics between the two
groups (Table 1).

Distance error
The average distance error between the estimated
location and the actual initial location significantly
decreased in proportion to the number of sessions
(F = 3226.696, p < 0.001), indicating an improvement in spatial cognition of subjects in the EG. Post
hoc test revealed a significant difference in the average of distance error between the first session and
the final session (p < 0.001) (Figure 2).

Spatial cognition
Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that group ×
time interaction was significant for WAIS-BDT (p <
0.001; η[2] = 0.667) (Table 2). This result indicated
that those in the EG achieved clinical improvement
in spatial cognition compared to those in the CG.

Episodic memory
Results showed a significant group × time interaction for the recall of SVLT (p < 0.05; η[2] = 0.094).


-----

However, there was no significant group × time
interaction for the recognition of SVLT (p > 0.05;
η[2] = 0.001) (Table 2). These findings suggested
that those in the EG showed greater improvement
in recall but not in recognition.

### Discussion


In this study, older adults with MCI who underwent
VR-SCT showed significant improvements in both
spatial cognition and episodic memory. As expected,
VR-SCT might be useful for improving hippocampal
function of older adults with MCI, in line with results
of previous studies (Savulich et al., 2017; Meade
et al., 2019).
Active navigation has a clinical usefulness in
improving spatial cognition of older adults with MCI
compared to passive navigation (Howett et al., 2019).
Accordingly, in this study, VR-SCT was implemented
through active navigation rather than passive navigation to maximize its effects. Results of this study
confirmed that spatial cognition was increased after
the 8-week intervention, suggesting that VR-SCT
might be helpful in improving the hippocampal
function of older adults with MCI. Spatial cognition
that mainly relies on hippocampal function could be
enhanced following navigation experiences (Meade
et al., 2019), consistent with results of this study.
Indeed, a previous study has reported that hippocampal volumes of London taxi drivers are larger
than those of controls, indicating that the hippocampal function might be due to experience-dependent
changes (Maguire et al., 2006). In addition, several
neuroimaging studies showed that increases of gray
matter in right posterior hippocampus were observed
in individuals who performed spatial tasks (Boyke
et al., 2008, Laczó et al., 2017).
Specifically, allocentric navigation strategy was
adopted to perform VR-SCT in the present study.
Allocentric navigation strategy requires visualizing
cognitive map using object-to-object relationship
from an environment-centered viewpoint (Colombo
et al., 2017). Previous neuroimaging studies have
indicated that allocentric strategy is correlated with
hippocampal function, suggesting that VR-SCT with
allocentric navigation strategy rather than egocentric
navigation strategy should be implemented in order
to enhance hippocampal function (Iaria et al., 2007).
Additionally, in the present study, since no local
landmark information was presented, the EG group
was focused on processing allocentric boundary
information. A previous study has indicated that
when older adults search for a certain goal location
with landmark cues, activation in striatum rather than
in hippocampus is increased, suggesting that VR-SCT
needs to provide minimal landmark information for


-----

hippocampal function (Schuck et al., 2015). These
characteristics of VR-SCT might be factors that
could maximize effects of VR-SCT.
Meanwhile, to present conditions that resemble
daily life, spatial cognitive tasks based on VR have
been used in several previous studies (Daugherty
et al., 2015; Howett et al., 2019) as well as in this
study. Indeed, some studies on older adults with
MCI have found a close correlation in performance
between real and virtual environments (Cushman
et al., 2008; Plancher et al., 2012). Therefore, in this
study, improvements in spatial cognition of the
subjects in the EG group might be said to have a
high relationship with spatial cognition in their
daily life.
After the 8-week intervention, episodic memory
was also improved in the EG group. Previous neuroimaging studies have found that hippocampus is
primarily responsible for episodic memory as well as
spatial cognition (Tulving, 2002). Therefore, enhanced
hippocampal function through VR-SCT might have
a positive impact on episodic memory. Indeed, a
previous study has shown that VR-SCT can induce
improvements in episodic memory (Savulich et al.,
2017). However, in the present study, VR-SCT did
not result in significant improvement in recognition.
This could be explained by the fact that recognition
is not as closely correlated with hippocampal function as retrieval. Although recognition partially relies
on hippocampal function at the stage of encoding,
previous studies have consistently presented that
recognition could be accomplished by familiarity
rather than episodic recollection in extrahippocampal regions (Rugg and Yonelinas, 2003; Montaldi
and Mayes, 2010). These results suggest that recognition does not heavily rely on hippocampal function
(Gilbert and Moran, 2016).
The present study has some limitations. First,
although this study attempted to secure ecological
validity by using VR, real-world navigation requires
actual movement, leading to limitations in generalizing the results of this study (Howett et al., 2019).
Since physical components such as locomotion and
proprioception could affect navigation, future studies
need to involve actual movement during VR-SCT.
Second, this study could not confirm the superiority
of three-dimensional SCT compared with SCT in
two dimensions because two-dimensional training
was not included as a control, resulting in limitations
in its advancement. Finally, as changes in medial
temporal lobe structures involved in spatial cognition
such as entorhinal cortex were not identified using
neuroimaging devices, it was hard to exclude their
influence on the effect. Therefore, to demonstrate
more objective effects, future studies should present
neuroimaging results and behavioral or neuropsychological results.


### Conclusion

These results of this study suggest that VR-SCT can
improve hippocampal function. Given that the efficacy of conventional cognitive training for older
adults with MCI remains controversial, results of
this study have crucial important clinical significance.
The current findings suggest that spatial memory
training in various places in everyday life would
be an ecologically validated treatment in clinical
settings.
