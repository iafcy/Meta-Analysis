_Background:_ Evidence-based interventions to improve mobility in older people include balance, strength and
cognitive training. Digital technologies provide the opportunity to deliver tailored and progressive programs at
home. However, it is unknown if they are effective in older people, especially in those with cognitive
impairment.
_Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of a novel tablet-delivered cognitive-motor program_
on mobility in older people with cognitive impairment.
_Methods: This was a 6-month single-blind randomised controlled trial of older people living in the community_
with subjective and/or objective cognitive impairment. Participants randomised to the intervention were asked
to follow a 120 min per week balance, strength and cognitive training program delivered via an app on an iPad.
Both the intervention and control group received monthly phone calls and health fact sheets. The primary
outcome measure was gait speed. Secondary measures included dual-task gait speed, balance (step test, FISCIT4), 5 sit to stand test, cognition (executive function, memory, attention), mood and balance confidence.
Adherence, safety, usability and feedback were also measured.
_Results: The planned sample size of 110 was not reached due to COVID-19 restrictions. A total of 93 (mean age_
72.8 SD 7.0 years) participants were randomised to the two groups. Of these 77 participants returned to the
follow-up clinic. In intention-to-treat analysis for gait speed, there was a non-significant improvement favouring
the intervention group (β 0.04 m/s 95% CI -0.01, 0.08). There were no significant findings for secondary out­
comes. Adherence was excellent (84.5%), usability of the app high (76.7% SD 15.3) and no serious adverse
events were reported. Feedback on the app was positive and included suggestions for future updates.
_Conclusion: Due to COVID-19 the trial was under powered to detect significant results. Despite this, there was a_
trend towards improvement in the primary outcome measure. The excellent adherence and positive feedback
about the app suggest a fully powered trial is warranted.


Adequate mobility in old age is important to maintain independence
in activities of daily living and participate in leisure activities (Callisaya


and Verghese, 2018). Gait speed is commonly used to measure mobility
objectively, and slow gait speed is associated with a number of adverse
outcomes including disability (Perera et al., 2016), falls (Callisaya et al.,
2011) hospitalisation and increased need for care (Montero-Odasso

et al., 2005). There are a number of factors that contribute to slow gait
speed, with two of the most modifiable being muscle weakness and poor
balance (Callisaya et al., 2009; Tiedemann et al., 2005). Cognitive
ability is also important for maintaining gait speed, having a role in
responding quickly to perturbations, being able to carry out a secondary
task, and analysing and decision-making in complex environments
(Jayakody et al., 2020; Martin et al., 2013a). In line with this, poorer
cognition, especially the domains of executive function and processing
speed, are associated with slower gait speed (Martin et al., 2013a) and
risk of falls (Muir et al., 2012; Martin et al., 2013b). Importantly, having
subjective or objective cognitive impairment in combination with slow
gait speed increases the risk of falls to a greater extent than slow gait
speed alone (Martin et al., 2013b; Callisaya et al., 2016).
In people with cognitive impairment, exercise alone or in combina­
tion with cognitive training can improve mobility (Lam et al., 2018;
Zhang et al., 2019). Technology may provide a novel way to deliver
interventions and enhance adherence and enjoyment for older people in
their own homes, with the additional benefit of incorporating behaviour
reinforcements such as feedback on performance and goal attainment
(Valenzuela et al., 2018). The StandingTall program is an app that de­
livers a tailored and progressive balance and strength program to pre­
vent falls in older people, with incorporated feedback and goal setting
(Delbaere et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2020). Recently, the app was
modified to include the addition of cognitive exercises (inhibition,
working memory and task shifting) that are performed in combination
with the balance exercises. However, the efficacy of the app on mobility
in people with cognitive impairment has not been examined.
Therefore, the aim of this study was, in people with subjective
cognitive decline and/or objective cognitive impairment, to: (i) examine
the efficacy of a 6-month StandingTall program on improving known fall
risk factors – single-task gait speed (primary outcome measure), dualtask gait speed, balance, strength, reaction time and cognitive func­
tion; (ii) examine the adherence, acceptability, safety and satisfaction of
the program; and (iii) determine feasibility for a larger study examining
efficacy on risk of falls.

**2. Materials and methods**

_2.1. Design_

This was a two-arm parallel-randomised controlled trial (RCT) with
6-months follow-up carried out in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. The trial
was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (Tasmania)
Network (H0016983) and prospectively registered on the Australian and
New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12618001062213).
Funding was provided by the National Health and Medical Research
Council (1135761).

_2.2. Participants_

Participants were recruited through general practitioners, hospital
geriatric clinics, advertisements in the local newspaper, talks at retire­
ment villages and other community organisations. Inclusion criteria
included: >60 years of age; willing to adhere to the study procedures for
6-months and attend the pre- and post-clinics; cognitive impairment (a
subjective cognitive decline over past 5 years and/or a Montreal
Cognitive Assessment [MOCA] scores between 19 and 26 and/or a
medical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment); ability to walk in own
home without a gait aide or furniture. Exclusion criteria included de­
mentia, a score of <19 on the MOCA or a MOCA between 19 and 26 and
a score of >9 on the Functional Activities Questionnaire. Other exclu­
sion criteria included an unstable medical condition precluding exercise,
other neurological conditions (e.g. Parkinson's disease, multiple scle­
rosis or stroke), residing in a nursing home, participating in another
clinical trial that would bias the outcomes or participating in an exercise
program designed to improve balance, and life expectancy <12 months.


Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

_2.3. Randomisation and masking_

Participants were randomised after baseline assessment. Random­
isation was stratified by age (<70 or ≥ 70 years) and sex with permuted
blocks of ten. A research nurse not involved in the assessment of out­
comes or the intervention carried out the randomisation using a central
automated allocation procedure based on computer-generated random
numbers. Outcomes assessors were blinded to study group assignment.

_2.4. Procedures_

_2.4.1. Both groups_
Both the control and intervention group received monthly health
information fact sheets via post on topics such as eyesight, diet, footwear
and physical activity for the duration of the trial. Both groups also
received a monthly phone call to ask about falls (see outcomes).

_2.4.2. Intervention group_
Intervention group participants received an iPad with the _Stand­_
_ingTall program. The program consisted of progressively more difficult_
balance, strength and cognitive exercises tailored to the person. Par­
ticipants were provided with an internet connection if they did not have
one at home. An initial visit (1− 2h) by an exercise physiologist or
physiotherapist was undertaken to explain the use of the equipment, to
ensure a safe location to exercise, to carry out an initial balance
assessment via the app to tailor the program to the person's ability, and
carry out one 10-min exercise session. Follow-up visits to review prog­
ress and features of the app occurred in weeks 2 and 8 (<1 h) and then by
monthly phone calls. The program built to a total of 2 h of balance ex­
ercises per week (from 40 min in weeks 1 and 2, to 120 min from week 9
onwards), with cognitive dual-tasking exercises added in week 8 (see
Fig. 1 for examples of the exercises; range of >6000 exercise variations).
Balance exercises incorporate movement of the centre of mass, nar­
rowing of base of support, minimising upper limb support, turning and
changing directions, ankle/hip and stepping strategies, challenging
vision, sensation and vestibular systems and stepping up and over ob­
jects. Cognitive tasks are added to balance exercises by using auditory
and visual cues. Three core executive functions are engaged: inhibition
(the ability to consciously override automated or dominant responses),
working memory (the ability to hold, process, and manipulate infor­
mation in mind) and task shifting (the ability to switch flexibly between
tasks or mental sets). Safety measures included setting up the environ­
ment (e.g. near a table or chair for support; appropriate footwear;
exclusion of foam or box exercises if deemed unsafe; use of carer/partner
if required; instructions to keep a phone nearby; information leaflet on
what to do in the case of a fall). Participants were also provided with an
instruction booklet that included information on safe exercise tips and
use of the iPad and the app. The difficulty of the balance and cognitive
exercises progressed (in complexity and length) automatically, based on
participant's self-reported rating of each exercise. The app provided
videos and instructions for each exercise. Each exercise was repeated
three times. Participants could choose the time they wished to exercise
(e.g. 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 min) to reach the weekly time goal. Feedback
on adherence to participants was available through the app via a weekly
counter and a graph, and to researchers via a dashboard following data
transfer to a secure server kept by Neuroscience Research Australia.
Other features of the app included exercise notification reminders and
(optional) individualised goal setting.

_2.5. Outcomes_

All participants were assessed at baseline and 6 months.


-----

**Fig. 1. Consort statement.**


_2.5.1. Primary outcome_
Gait speed (m/s) was measured on a 6.4 m Zeno electronic walkway
(Zenometrics LLC, Peekskill, NY) with ProKinetics Movement Analysis
Software (PKMAS). Participants completed four walks that started 1.5 m
before and finished 1.5 m after the walkway to allow for acceleration
and deceleration.

_2.5.2. Secondary outcomes_
_Dual-task gait:_ Gait speed (m/s) was measured as described above
while performing a secondary cognitive task (counting backwards in 3 s
and alternating letters of the alphabet). Cognitive function was obtained
with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery that included the
Trail Making Test, Victoria Stroop task, Controlled Oral Word


Association Test (COWAT) animals, Digital Symbol Coding tests and the
Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (Lezak, 1995); Muscle strength with the 5
sit to stand test; Balance with the 15 s step test and the Frailty and In­
juries Cooperative Studies of Intervention Techniques test (FICSIT-4)
(Rossiter-Fornoff et al., 1995); _Balance confidence_ with the Activities
Balance Confidence Scale and Mood with the Geriatric Depression Scale
(Yesavage et al., 1982). Other information to describe the sample at
baseline included age, sex, self-reported medical history, activities of
daily living (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living – Prevention in­
strument) (Galasko et al., 2006) and Lifespace with the Life-space
questionnaire (how far and often a person goes outside of their home)
(Baker et al., 2003). Falls were obtained monthly via a phone call for six
months and were defined as ‘an unexpected event in which the


-----

participant comes to rest on the ground, floor or lower level’ (Lamb
et al., 2005).

_2.5.3. Process outcomes_
In the intervention group, usability of the app was assessed with the
System Usability Scale (Bangor et al., 2008) and feedback about the app
features were obtained with a structured questionnaire developed by the
researchers. The questionnaire included a five-point Likert scale
regarding the overall rating of the program and friendless, as well as
open ended questions about reasons for participation in the study,
benefits of the app and what participants liked or didn't like about the
program. Exercise adherence (volume, frequency) was monitored for 6
months. Adherence was calculated as a percentage of the minutes pre­
scribed for that week. If a participant withdrew then adherence was


calculated until the date of withdrawal. Adverse events were defined as a
fall or cardiac event during the exercise program or a musculoskeletal
injury potentially or definitely due to the program.

_2.6. Statistical analysis_

_2.6.1. Sample size_
For the primary outcome of gait speed a sample size of 110 was
calculated to provide sufficient power (90%, 2-tailed, p < 0.05) to detect
a clinically meaningful difference of 0.1 m/s (SD 0.15) between groups
allowing for a 10% drop out (Perera et al., 2006). For other measures a
sample of n = 110, 80% power (2-tailed p < 0.05) provided power to
detect effect sizes as low as 0.269 (using the F-test).

_2.6.2. Analysis plan_
Numbers of participants screened, eligible, having baseline and
follow-up assessment, withdrawals and numbers included in the ana­
lyses were reported in accordance with the CONSORT flow chart. The
characteristics of the sample at baseline were summarised overall and by
group using the means and standard errors for continuous measures and
by frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Linear mixed
effect models and intention-to-treat analyses were used to assess the
effect of time for each group and group×time on outcomes reporting
beta-coefficients and 95% confidence intervals in an unadjusted model.
A second model was examined including age and sex and additionally
any covariates identified as being clinically different between groups at
baseline. In sub-analyses, we repeated the analysis for the primary
outcome excluding those who adhered to less than 70% of the program.
Open-ended questions were reported descriptively to highlight themes
in responses.

**3. Results**

Over 12 months (April 2019–March 2020), 135 participants were
screened for eligibility, of whom 93 (mean age 72.8 SD 7.0 years; 42%
male) were randomised and assigned to the intervention or control
group (Fig. 2 CONSORT statement).

_3.1. Impact of COVID-19_

The planned sample size of 110 was not achieved due to COVID-19
restrictions halting the ability to run face-to-face clinics and home
visits. One participant allocated to the intervention was also unable to
start due to social distancing restrictions. No follow-up clinics were able
to run between the end of March 2020 and July 2020. Participants were
invited to return for the final clinics in mid July 2020 after easing of
some COVID-19 restrictions, but some participants declined due to ongoing concerns. Recruitment did not recommence due to the on-going
uncertainty of the pandemic. Fig. 1 provides reasons for withdrawal,
with 77 participants returning to the final clinic.

_3.2. Primary outcome_

Baseline characteristics of the sample are summarised in Table 1.
There were some notable clinical difference between groups for the
proportion of past falls, diabetes and pain levels. Statistical tests be­
tween groups for characteristics were not performed in-line with the
CONSORT statement (Schulz et al., 2010). Table 2 provides the unad­
justed means and standard errors for the primary and secondary out­
comes at baseline and 6 months, the mean change over time in each
group and the adjusted (Model 1 unadjusted; Model 2 adjusted for age,
sex, pain, diabetes and past falls) between group differences. The results
did not meaningfully differ between the unadjusted and adjusted results.
There was no significant difference between groups for the primary
outcome measure of gait speed (β 0.04 m/s 95% CI -0.01, 0.08; _p_ =
0.09). In sub-analysis excluding those whose adherence to the program
was less than 70% (n = 9) did not meaningfully change the results (β
0.04 95%CI -0.01, 0.08; p = 0.09).

_3.3. Secondary outcomes_

There was also no other significant differences for secondary
outcome measures. Over the 6-month period, falls were reported by 29%
(13.7% had multiple falls) of the intervention group and 22.4% of the
control group reported a fall (8.1% had multiple falls). As the sample
was heterogeneous in relation to cognition, we carried out an a-poste­
riori analysis stratifying the sample by the MoCA (≥ 26; _<26) (Nas­_
reddine et al., 2005). There was one significant finding (out of 19
comparisons) of greater improvement in gait speed during the dual-task
numbers test favouring the intervention group (Supplementary Table 1).

_3.4. Process outcomes_

_3.4.1. Adherence_
The overall adherence to the program in the intervention group was
84.5%. Of participants completing the full intervention period (n = 30)
the adherence was 91.5% over the 6 months. In those that did not
complete the full period (n = 11) adherence was 69.5%.
User experience questionnaire.
The average score on the system usability scale was 76.7/100 (SD
15.3). The percentage of participants reporting a subjective benefit of
the program (yes/no) was 89.1%. Overall ratings on the program were
as follows: 32.4% rated it as very good, 54.0% as good and 13.5% as
neither good nor bad. User-friendliness of the program was rated as
follows: 27.0% as very good; 54% good and 18.9% as neither good nor
bad. No participants rated the overall program or user-friendliness as
poor or very poor.

_3.4.2. Adverse events_
There were 7 adverse events potentially or definitely due to the
program. This included one non-injurious fall using the box (which was
then turned off for this participant) and 6 complaints of new, or
aggravation of existing, musculoskeletal pain (three definitely and two
potentially related to the exercise program). Two musculoskeletal events
(hip and knee pain) occurred in the same participant and one further
event in a separate participant (knee pain). It was determined that the
box exercises were the contributing factor and were subsequently turned
off for these participants.

_3.4.3. User experience questionnaire open-ended questions_
Improving balance and memory, preventing falls and dementia, and
supporting research were given as the main reasons for participating in
the trial. Participants liked the commitment, discipline and flexibility to
do the exercise at home, and the mental and physical challenges the
program offered. Participants reported subjective improvement in bal­
ance, confidence, memory and processing speed. Some participants
noted that the program was somewhat repetitive and boring, others
expressed that certain exercises were too difficult. Competing work or

**4. Discussion**

This randomised controlled trial examined the efficacy of an inno­
vative app that delivered a tailored and progressive physical and
cognitive exercise program to older people with subjective and objective
cognitive impairment. The _StandingTall_ program resulted in a nonsignificant difference in the primary outcome of gait speed of 0.04 m/
s (95% CI -0.01, 0.08) in a group of older people with subjective and
objective cognitive impairment.
The _StandingTall_ program targets balance, strength and cognition,
factors associated with poor mobility and risk of falls in older people.
Prior meta-analyses have found cognitive training alone (Marusic et al.,
2018) or physical interventions such as combined resistance, balance
and endurance exercises can improve mobility (Van Abbema et al.,
2015). Further systematic reviews also support combined cognitivemotor training to improve mobility (Zhang et al., 2019; Gavelin et al.,
2020), with simultaneous better than sequential exercise (Tait et al.,


2017). The mean difference between groups of 0.04 m/s is clinically
small (Perera et al., 2006), but similar to findings of a meta-analysis
examining the effect of progressive resistance and balance training or
multi-modal training on gait speed (Van Abbema et al., 2015).
In many previous studies exercise was performed in groups or
outside participants' home (Zhang et al., 2019), which may not suit all
older people (Yardley et al., 2008). Reported barriers to exercise include
time, self-efficacy, motivation and access to classes (Ziebart et al., 2018).
Technology provides a feasible way for older people to exercise in their
own home (Taylor et al., 2020; Daly et al., 2021; Simpson et al., 2020;
Geraedts et al., 2017; van Het Reve et al., 2014), which has the potential
to increase long-term adherence (Valenzuela et al., 2018). Adherence
(obtained by the program itself rather than self-reported by the partic­
ipant) was excellent, and similar or better than prior studies that used
technology to deliver exercise over similar (Geraedts et al., 2017) or
shorter periods (Daly et al., 2021). Participants knew that they were
being monitored, and so this may have provided additional motivation/
discipline. However, adherence was lower in those who eventually
withdrew from the program early. Motivation and self-efficacy are
important factors to consider when starting an exercise program and
some older people may require greater assistance in staying motivated


-----

and choosing programs that meet their needs and preferences (Ziebart
et al., 2018).
Participants reported subjective benefits in terms of balance and
memory, and liked the discipline and flexibility of doing the program at
home. The majority of participants also expressed that they wanted
exercises to improve mobility and prevent falls and dementia, suggest­
ing a need for such programs. There is potential for the _StandingTall_
program to be offered to all older people with subjective cognitive
impairment at a population-wide level. Alternatively, StandingTall could
be prescribed by health professionals as a stand-alone intervention or in
conjunction with face-to-face or group classes. Experience from this
study suggests that an initial home visit is essential in people with
subjective or objective cognitive impairment to ensure safety of the
home set up and additional tailoring of the exercises. Follow-up visits
were useful to reinforce safety, and also to assist those participants who
were unfamiliar with using technology. Furthermore, engaging part­
ners/family to supervise exercises and six-monthly reviews may be
useful to check on safety, especially if a decline in cognitive function is
expected.
An unexpected aspect of the program was that for some people it
highlighted their strengths and weaknesses with some perceptively
reporting differences in left and right leg balance or in visual versus
verbal recall ability. However, some participants found the time needed
to commit to the program difficult, with five people withdrawing due to
being too busy. Some reported the exercises often took them longer than
the time chosen, and this was reported as a frustration. Others thought
that the exercises were repetitive, although this was also recognised as
important for improvement. Subsequent versions of the app may need to
look at reducing the time between exercises. Feedback provided on the
program will assist in developing the app for future widespread scale-up.

_4.1. Limitations_

In addition to the impact of COVID-19 on recruitment, six partici­
pants did not return to the final clinic due to COVID-19 concerns, two
participants dropped out of the intervention due to medical conditions
(stroke and total hip replacement), and five reported they were too busy
to complete the program. In addition, musculoskeletal events were re­
ported by 5 participants. The box exercise aggravated some participants
pre-existing hip and knee pain and therefore this exercise may need to be
modified by starting with a smaller step or strengthening provided using
alternative exercises. Older people are likely to have medical problems,
and it is a balance between excluding those with chronic conditions and
generalisability. The majority of participants already had Wi-Fi at home,
and it is possible technology naive older people may require greater
training than provided in this study. Finally, feedback on the program
was obtained via a questionnaire. Qualitative interviews may have
resulted in richer information about the intervention and its delivery
method.
In conclusion, although we did not find significant differences be­
tween groups, participants found the StandingTall app easy to use and
reported subjective benefits from the program including improved
functioning. The program appears feasible in terms of recruitment and
adherence for people with subjective and objective cognitive impair­
ment and warrants a larger definitive trial to determine efficacy.
