Abstract
Background: Although cognitive training is effective for people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), it is not clear which
format is more effective. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of the same language programs when carried out via computer, paper/pencil and orally in people with MCI. Methods: Seventy-one participants with MCI were randomly classified in 3
experimental and 2 control groups. The experimental groups attended 48 sessions of language training for 6 months. The control
groups attended either unstructured sessions or they were on waiting list. Results: Mixed measures analysis of variance, at the
follow-up, showed a significant cognitive abilities improvement among the experimental versus control groups. At the end of the
language training, the 3 groups presented improvement in cognitive abilities and daily function, while the control groups remained
at the same performance level. Conclusion: All 3 cognitive language training methods were equally significantly effective.

## Introduction

 Background

With the aging of the population, the number of people with
age-dependent disorders is increasing and the prevalence of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is rapidly growing, expected to
nearly triple by 2050.[1] The increasing number of older people
with AD is a burden not only to the people who meet the
diagnostic criteria but also to their families and to the social
system. Therefore, research has focused on identifying
approaches that might slow disease progression[2] and developing lifestyle strategies that may delay onset or reduce AD
risk.[3,4] Another avenue of investigation is to discover early
detection methods for people who may be in the prodromal
phase of disease progression, so they may be targeted in treatment when it might be most effective.[5] Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between healthy elderly and
dementia[6] and is considered to be a prodromal phase of AD.
Mild cognitive impairment of amnestic plus multiple domain
type (aMCImd) is characterized by several deficits such as
attention and executive function decline, verbal or visual memory, and language problems.[7-9] The language deficits have to
do with language comprehension,[10] accuracy in syntactic


reasoning,[11] and naming a rhyming word. Deficits in performance on a variety of other tests for semantic memory, such as
lexical decision, semantic categorization,[12] semantic encoding,[13] and semantic priming,[14] and in productive and receptive
discourse-level processing have also been reported in MCI.[15,16]

The naming impairment seems to be the most common
between other deficits and may originate from disturbances
at the level of lexical–semantic processing, that is, a contextdependent impairment of access to, or inability to use,
structurally intact semantic representations.[17] Alternatively,
word-finding and word comprehension problems may originate
from an actual loss in semantic knowledge that gives rise to a

deficit that is consistent for a given item across a variety of
tasks.[18,19]

In addition to assessing knowledge and memory, verbal
fluency may also affect other cognitive processes including
components of executive function such as divergent reasoning
to generate category exemplars, maintaining a cognitive set of
the overarching category while flexibly searching subcategories, working memory (WM) for prior responses, and inhibition of noncategory items.[20] Moreover, our recent study has
proved that naming abilities seem to be affected in patients
with AD, although individuals with MCI tend to exhibit greater
impairments in category fluency.[21] Verbal fluency deficits in
MCI, especially category fluency, confrontation naming deficits as well as in language comprehension[21] and accuracy in
syntactic reasoning,[11] are referred. As the lexical–semantic
processing is typically affected early in the disease course, it
constitutes a primary target for detection and prognosis of MCI,
since there are reductions in lexical activation in MCI as well as
impairments in activation of multiple semantic representations.[9] More specifically, “secondary verbs per utterance,
percentage of clauses, percentage of right-branching and leftbranching clauses, propositions per utterance, conjunctions per
utterance, mean duration of pauses, and standardized phonation
time have all been reported to show significant differences
between healthy older adults and patients with MCI or AD”.[22]

Since no literature consensus about pharmacological interventions exists and medical treatment is not recommended for
people with MCI,[23-25] it is prominent to develop nonpharmacological therapies that would enhance cognitive abilities and
therefore delay the onset of neurodegeneration.[26]

Cognitive training (CT), the most popular nonpharmacological intervention, seems to be the most appropriate method for
people with MCI. The basic aim of CT is to practice and
enhance specific cognitive abilities that are trained. Many studies exist, providing evidence about the effectiveness of CT.
Some among the CT programs were designed to improve a
single cognitive ability and some others to improve multiple
cognitive domains.[27] Multifaceted cognitive training for attention, memory, abstract thinking and constructional abilities
might be effective interventions for people with MCI who
present multiple cognitive problems.[28]

Cognitive training is either carried out in groups of 5 to 6
people or individually and the training tasks are mostly based on
intelligence components, such as image rerecognition and
assignment, pictures sequences, cube tasks, row formation, correct recognition of sets of words or images, perception speed,
assignment tasks, speaking tasks, search tasks and so on. Nowadays, it is not clear enough which type of training is more effective. Is the classic cognitive training provided via paper and
pencil, oral tasks, or a computer more effective? Although there
is a recent study administered in people with MCI, providing
evidence about the effectiveness of both versions (computerbased training and paper and pencil training) in a broad range
of cognitive functions, such as executive function, attention, and
verbal memory,[29] it still remains unclear which means of
training is the most effective for people with MCI


## Conceptual Framework

The present single-blind randomized controlled trial tried to
evaluate the impact of a language training program in aMCImd,
community-dwelling, and Greek-speaking people, aged from
60 to 80 years provided via different means of training (computer based, paper and pencil, and oral). The primary aim was
to investigate which format (tasks with paper and pencil, oral,
or computer-based tasks) is more effective in people with MCI
and to compare these 3 groups with 2 different control groups.
The secondary aim was to separately evaluate the program’s
effectiveness in these 3 groups and to investigate whether the
groups could manage to transfer the cognitive benefit to reallife conditions. Additionally, another goal was to generalize the
benefit in other cognitive domains such as semantic memory
and cognitive parameters of executive function. Our main
hypotheses were as follows:

The 3 experimental groups would present better performance only compared to control groups.
The paper and pencil group (PP/G) would present better
performance than the computer-based program of language tasks group (PC/G), because we assumed that
training via paper and pencil is more familiar to older
adults older than 65 years, since they use writing for
several reasons. Moreover, writing is also a procedure
that activates more brain regions than computerized
and oral training.

The participants who participated in these 3 formats of
training should present improvements not only in language but also in other cognitive abilities.

neurological examination, neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric assessment, neuroimaging (computed tomography or
magnetic resonance imaging), and blood tests by a consensus
of specialized health professionals, experts in neurocognitive
disorders.
Of the 150 visitors at the day care center of Alzheimer
Hellas, 50 were excluded because they didn’t met the criteria
(20 met the diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder, 15 had
severe depression or anxiety, 5 had other systematic diseases
such as uncontrolled hypertension, 3 had other neurological
disorders, and 7 people had serious sensory problems). Thus,
100 participants with aMCImd were randomly assigned into 5
groups. The first experimental group (n ¼ 20) attended a PC/G,
the second (n ¼ 20) attended the same tasks via PP/G, and the
third (n ¼ 20) performed the same tasks orally (OR/G). The
fourth group (n ¼ 20) was an active control group (AC/G) that
has followed unstructured sessions with discussion of current
events, while the fifth one (n ¼ 20) was a passive control group
without any kind of pharmaceutical or cognitive intervention—
waiting list (C/G). Only 71 people completed the follow-up and
were considered for the analysis (22 males and 49 females with
mean [M] standard deviation [SD] of 68.61 [7.00] years old),
with 10.99 (4.17) years of education, and with Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE) of 27.28 (2.16). Participants were
matched in age (P ¼ .222), gender (P ¼ .618), and education
(P ¼ .674; Table 1).

## Randomization, Allocation Concealment, and Blinding

This study aims to minimize the selection bias by using randomization and allocation concealment. Prior to inclusion of participants, a technician performed randomization using an
algorithm. Until the completion of the last long-term followup only the project leader and 2 persons responsible for the


interviews and focus groups had access to the information on
group allocation. Due to the nature of the therapy programs,
blinding of the participants and instructors is not possible.
However, all the independent evaluators are blinded with
respect to group allocation, and the participants are not
informed of primary outcome measures or the study hypothesis. To maintain group allocation confidentiality, participants
are requested prior to each assessment phase not to reveal
allocation or therapy content to the evaluators. Participants
scheduled for qualitative studies are told that they must not talk
to the evaluators about participation in interviews and neuropsychological assessment. Furthermore, the interviews and
focus groups were performed in a way that does not reveal
participants’ allocation. After the baseline assessment, eligible
and consenting people with aMCImd were randomized in each
of the 5 groups.

## Withdrawals and Discontinuation

The study would stop if any of the following occurs:

� Participant death or discharge.
� Incident dizziness.
� Medical problems related to exercises (auditorial, visual
problems, and so on).
� The participant experiences adverse event(s) that require
discontinuation in the judgment of the principal investigator or instructor.
� The participant has a need for additional intervention
that would interfere with the trial.
� The participant neglects to follow trial instructions.
� The participant has lost more than 5 lessons and has not
attended additional lessons to cover this gap.
� The participant or their legally authorized representative
request consent withdrawal (Figure 1)

## Language Intervention

The study participants attended the CT program, at the Day Care
Center of Alzheimer Hellas, at the same time in the morning or
afternoon. Cognitive training included tasks, focused in the training and enhancement of semantic expression of language,
semantic comprehension of language and phonemic expression
of language. The tasks were ecologically valid, as they were
derived from activities of daily living (ADLs), and were not
similar to the tasks included in the neuropsychological tests.
Each set of cognitive tasks had 3 levels of difficulty. In the first
session, the participants were evaluated with respect to their
language skills in order to initiate with the appropriate difficulty
level. The trainees could remain at the same level or proceed to a
more difficult one, according to their performance.
Each session comprised 10 tasks. The primary aim of the
language tasks was to activate the vocabulary. The 10 tasks are
divided into 3 subtasks of semantic expression 3 subtasks of


semantic comprehension and 4 subtasks of phonemic expression of language. However, it is impossible to separate the
cognitive skills necessary for the tasks execution. Therefore,
the tasks implementation also required several other cognitive
abilities, apart from language, such as selective attention and
shift of attention, WM, inhibition control and executive function (phonological organization, use of phonological strategies
and control of meaning). An illustration of “paper and pencil
tasks”, “computer tasks” and “oral tasks” can be found in Figures 2, and 3, respectively.

## Examples of the CT Tasks, Third Level of Difficulty

First task: Put the letters in the right order and create the
correct words. The words you are going to create are
common fruits.
For example roagne ¼ orange

Figure 2. Example photo from computer-based version.

Second task: Put the words in the right order, so as to
correctly recreate the sentences. The first word of the
sentence is presented with a capital letter.
For example, dirty / has / week / to / Mrs / her / this / is /
Mary / house / because / clean / very ¼ Mrs Mary has
to clean her house this week because it is very dirty
Third task: Write 7 words for which the initial letter is the
letter -a, and the last letter is the letter -s.
For example, animals

The training was provided via different means such as computer, paper and pencil, and oral. The tasks were the same for
the 3 groups of CT and they were administered using the same
order. The CT included 48 sessions and lasted 6 months. The
trainees visited the day care center twice a week and participated in 1-hour sessions The CT was applied in group sessions


Each group comprised 5 to 10 participants. The program was
administered by expert psychologists trained in cognitive
interventions.
The participants signed an informed consent and were aware
that they could withdraw their consent at any time without their
statutory rights or medical care being affected. The study was
approved by the Scientific and Ethics Committee of Alzheimer
Hellas. All groups underwent a neuropsychological examination 2 weeks prior to initialization of interventions and after 6
months.

## Neuropsychological Assessment

The programs effectiveness was examined by neuropsychological assessment performed at baseline and 6 months later,
which signified the program’s termination The participants

of each group were examined and followed up at the same time
and place, after the competence of the training period.
Neuropsychological assessment included a comprehensive
battery of psychometric tests (1) MMSE[33] for the assessment of
general cognitive function; (2) Functional Cognitive Assessment Scale[34] for general functional performance; (3) Functional Rating Scale for Symptoms of Dementia (FRSSD) for
ADL[35] (evaluates caregiver’s opinion about daily function of
people with cognitive disorders); (4) Rey Auditory Verbal
Learning test (RAVLT)[36] for verbal memory; (5) Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure test[37] for visual memory and visual constructive abilities; (6) Rivermead Behavioral test (RBMT;
history subtest),[38] for verbal episodic memory; (7) the total
score of Verbal Fluency test (FAS)[39] and its sub scores—the
3 Greek letters used were w (Chi), S (Sigma), and a (Alpha) for
executive function, (8) the Pyramids and Palm Trees (PPT) test
(raw score and performance time)[40]; and (9) Boston Diagnostic
Aphasia Examination (BDAE; subtests of narrative writing,
repetition, phonemic correlation, and reading comprehension
of sentences)[41] for language. The GDS[42] was used in order to
exclude patients with depression, while the neuropsychiatric
inventory[43] was used for the exclusion of people with psychopathological symptoms. We tried to avoid practice effects
using different test versions wherever necessary, namely, the
Taylor’s Complex Figure Test[44,45] for visual memory and
visual constructive abilities and California Auditory Verbal
Learning[46] for verbal memory.
As far as the language tests are concerned, we have used the
Greek version of the abovementioned language tests among the
available one. All the specific language tests used (apart from
PPT test) were validated for the Greek older population with


the appropriate normative data for people older than 65
years.[39,41] For example, the results of the validation study of
BDAE showed that there was a strong correlation between the
cognitive status and the BDAE’s performance of people with
neurocognitive disorders and normal aging.[41] Furthermore, the
FAS test was also validated for Greek older adults free of
cognitive deficits.[39]

## Data Statistical Analysis

The statistical analysis was performed with the IBM SPSS
Statistics for Windows, (version 23.0; IBM Corp, Armonk,
New York).[47] Demographic characteristics such as age, gender,
and education were analyzed at baseline using a univariate
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher exact test when
necessary. In order to determine whether significant difference
between all groups and times of assessment existed, a mixedmeasure ANOVA 5 (between patients factor: group: PC/G-PP/
G-OR/G-AC/G-C/G) � 2 (within patient factor: time of assessment: baseline follow-up) was used. Multivariate ANOVA
(MANOVA) and the Scheffe multiple comparisons post hoc
criterion were also used. Scheffe test was considered as the best
choice for post hoc comparisons, as it tests if all possible comparisons are robust with respect to nonnormality and gives
maximum protection against making type I errors which was
our main concern in this study. The effect of cognitive training
for each group was separately analyzed with repeated measures
ANOVA.[48]

## Results

 The Effect of Group and Assessment Time

Baseline measurements showed that there were no statistically
significant differences between all groups in demographic
characteristics such as age (P ¼ .222), gender (P ¼ .618) or
education (P ¼ .674), and also in the majority of cognitive and
functional tests used. The RAVLT (digit span), PPT (time), and
BDAE (phonemic comprehension/repetition subtests) were
significantly different at baseline; therefore, any significant
difference at the follow-up was not taken into account at our
final results (Table 1).
Mixed measures ANOVA showed that there was a main
effect of time of assessment, F1,71 ¼ 29.3, P < .001, Z[2] ¼
.33, and a significant interaction effect, F4,71 ¼ 4.48, P <
.001, Z[2] ¼ .23, on verbal fluency-x (FAS [X]). The subsequent
MANOVA with group as the independent variable and performance in 2 times of assessment as the dependent ones, F20,71 ¼
2.70, P < .001, Z[2] ¼ .17, showed that at the follow-up there was
a significant effect of group in verbal fluency-x, F4,71 ¼ 4.90, P
< .001, Z[2] ¼ .22. The PP/G was found to score higher than AC/
G (P ¼ .050) and the OR/G to outperform the AC/G in the same
cognitive skill (P ¼ .039; Table 2). Within-group ANOVA
(repeated measures) between baseline and follow-up assessment in each group separately showed neither improvement

nor deterioration regarding the 5 groups’ performance on the
abovementioned ability.
As far as the verbal fluency-s (FAS [S]) is concerned, there
was also a main effect of time of assessment, F1,71 ¼ 36.0, P <
.001, Z[2] ¼ .38, and a significant interaction effect, F4,71 ¼ 3.70,
P < .001, Z[2] ¼ .20. The subsequent MANOVA with group as
the independent variable and performance in 2 times of assessment as the dependent ones, F20,71 ¼ 2.70, P < .001, Z[2] ¼ .17,
showed that at the follow-up there was a significant effect of
group in FAS (S), F4,71 ¼ 3.23, P < .001, Z[2] ¼ .16. The OR/G
scored higher than the C/G (P ¼ .046; Table 2). Within-group
analysis between baseline and follow-up showed neither
improvement nor deterioration regarding the 5 groups’ performance at the abovementioned ability.
Regarding the total verbal fluency (FAS total), a main
effect of time of assessment, F1,71 ¼ 74.4, P < .001, Z[2] ¼
.56 and a significant interaction effect, F4,71 ¼ 6.87, P < .001,
Z[2] ¼ .32, were also noticed. The subsequent ANOVA, F20,71
¼ 2.70, P < .001, Z[2] ¼ .17, showed that at the follow-up there
was a significant effect of group in FAS total, F4,71 ¼ 4.03,
P < .001, Z[2] ¼ .12. The OR/G outperformed the C/G (P ¼
.027; Table 2). Repeated measures between baseline and
follow-up assessment showed that after the language training,
the PC/G improved, F1,14 ¼ 7.80, P < .001, Z[2] ¼ .43, in FAS
total (P ¼ .019). The PP/G was also found to score higher at
the follow-up assessment than at baseline, F1,18 ¼ 36.4, P <
.001, Z[2] ¼ .69 (P ¼ .000). Finally, the OR/G also showed
improvement, F1,10 ¼ 35.49, P < .001, Z[2] ¼ .79 (P ¼ .000), in
FAS total. The AC/G and the C/G stabilized their performances and showed neither improvement nor deterioration
(Table 3).
As far as the other cognitive abilities that were assessed are
concerned, there was neither a main effect of time of assessment nor a significant interaction effect or a significant effect
of group. However, it was considered appropriate to examine
what is happening in each group separately. Therefore, the
within-group ANOVA between baseline and follow-up assessment showed that at the end of the language training the PC/G
showed deterioration, F1,14 ¼ 8.17, P < .001, Z[2] ¼ .38, in
phonemic correlation (BDAE; P ¼ .013), whereas the PP/G
showed improvement F1 18 ¼ 5 27 P < 001 Z[2] ¼ 23 (P ¼

## Discussion

The primary aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness
of the same language program when carried out via computer,
paper and pencil, or orally and to also compare the effectiveness of these 3 experimental groups to 2 different control


groups, an active and a passive one. The secondary aim was
to evaluate the language training program impact in people
with aMCImd. Our basic hypothesis was that the experimental
groups would have higher scores than control groups, whilst
our second hypothesis was that the PP/G would have better
performance than the PC/G. Furthermore, our third hypothesis
was that a well-structured language training program could not
only enhance language cognitive skills in people with
aMCImd, but also transfer the benefit of language programs
in other not directly practiced cognitive domains, such as in
executive function and ADL.
According to the results, our first hypothesis seems to be
confirmed, since at the end of the training sessions, the experimental groups (at least the PP/G and the OR/G) showed better
performance compared to the AC/G and the control one in
verbal fluency skills. Regarding the effectiveness of the experimental groups in comparison to C/G, our results are in agreement with many other studies that support the idea that
cognitive training is effective for people with MCI.[49-52] For
example, Herrera et al assessed the effectiveness of a
12-week memory-attention training program based on recognition in people with MCI. The results have shown that the
intervention group, compared to AC/G, showed improvement
in trained skills during the intervention such as episodic recall
and recognition. Besides, in their study in contrast to ours, the
cognitive training concerned attention skills and not language;
nevertheless, the experimental group showed better results than
active control, which is in accordance with our study, proving
that cognitive training is effective for people with MCI, compared to controls. Another study, the study of Gooding et al in
2016, compared 2 experimental groups with an AC/G.[52] The
first experimental group consisted of people with MCI who
were administered computerized cognitive training, while the
second was a group that was administered traditional computerized training plus a program that incorporated motivational
teaching and rehabilitation techniques. The training programs
lasted 16 weeks and the participants completed 30 hours of
training. The results showed that the experimental groups presented greater preservation of functioning in general cognitive
performance than the AC/G. The computerized training, plus
the motivational teaching strategies program, outperformed the
AC/G in verbal learning and verbal memory, while the traditional computerized training group also performed better than
the AC/G. Therefore, the study concludes that although the
computerized cognitive training is beneficial for people with
MCI, the most benefit may be offered when incorporated into a
therapeutic milieu rather than administered alone.
On the other hand, the Rose et al study in 2015 administered
a prospective memory training program using the Virtual Week
computer game.[51] The intervention lasted over a month, and
the participants were healthy elderly who completed 12 hourly
sessions. Training group was compared to a no-contact and an
AC/G. At the end of the training, the computerized memory
training group improved in comparison to controls in performance on real-world prospective memory and ADLs. The
study supports the idea that short-term training with the Virtual


-----

Week game can produce cognitive and neural plasticity that
may result in real-world benefits. In contrast to our study, the
experimental groups have not outperformed the C/Gs in ADL,
but this was expected since we used language training and not
prospective memory training. Prospective memory seems to be
associated with WM and executive function; therefore, the
primary training effect is more likely to be transferred into real
life.[53] Moreover, in comparison to our study, the training group
was healthy elderly and the training sessions lasted only 1
month.
Finally, Li et al in their study in 2017, administered a multimodel cognitive training program in people with MCI.[50] The
results showed that the multimodel cognitive training helped
patients with MCI to gain cognitive benefits compared to C/G,
in memory, visual spatial abilities and executive function after
6 months of training. Although the abovementioned studies
refer to practice of general cognitive functions and not only
practice of language skills, as our study refers, the aforementioned studies indicate that cognitive training (orientated either
in language skills or in other cognitive functions) is effective
for healthy elderly individuals, people with subclinical cognitive decline, and MCI compared to controls a result consistent
with our initial hypothesis.
As far as our second hypothesis is concerned (the PP/G
would show better performance than the PC/G), our results did
not confirm our hypothesis. The PP/G was not outperformed by
the PC/G, neither in language skills nor in other cognitive
abilities. Our secondary hypothesis relied on the fact that the
act of writing with paper and pencil is a quite different task than
the keyboard writing. That is because the hand writer, in order
to write a word, has to actively produce the letters, since he has
to form every single letter on his own.[54] Therefore, the writers
who use paper and pencil have to pay higher visual attention to
the writing process.[55] In contrast, the PC writing demands only
identification of the letters, since the letters are presented.[56]

Consequently, the act of handwriting seems to activate more
brain regions such as posterior cortical regions in the left hemisphere and central motor and sensory regions[56], and potentially
promotes greater brain changes than the computerized and oral
training. Our results seem to be in contrast with other studies
supporting the idea that the computer condition might be inferior to the paper and pencil condition. The study of Tsolaki et al
in 2017, for example,[29] compared 65 people who participated
in a traditional cognitive training program provided via paper
and pencil versus 59 people with MCI who participated in a
computer-based training. Their results showed that at the end of
the training (after 12 months), although computer-based training was effective in people with MCI, the administration of the
traditional cognitive training via paper and pencil improved a
greater range of cognitive abilities. However, in contrast to our
study, in the study by Tsolaki et al the basic aim was the
enhancement of attention and executive function abilities and
not the language skills. However, as indicated by the final
group results, our hypothesis that the paper and pencil tasks’
versions would be superior to the others is not supported since


there were no statistically significant differences between PP/G
compared to PC/G.
The third aim of the study was to evaluate the program’s
effectiveness to enhance specific language skills and to generalize the benefit in other cognitive domains. At the end of the
training, only the PP/G showed improvements in directly
trained abilities, such as verbal repetition and phonemic correlation. The OR/G showed language stability, while the PC/G at
the end of the training showed stability and a slight deterioration in verbal repetition. However, these findings seem
rational, since verbal repetition was not particularly trained in
the computer format in the same way as was trained for example in OR/G, besides the fact that the training tasks were the
same at the 3 formats.
As far as the generalization of the program’s effectiveness in
other cognitive domains than language, such as in semantic and
episodic verbal memory and in cognitive parameters of executive function is concerned, all the experimental groups (PC/G,
PP/G and OR/G) showed improvement in verbal fluency.
Although verbal fluency as an executive aspect of language
was an ability that was trained during the program, it was not
one of its main aims. The most impressive fact was that
although no significant language improvement was noticed at
least for all the experimental groups, all the training groups
have shown improvement in other general cognitive abilities
that were not directly practiced during the intervention. To be
more precise, the PC/G showed improvements in verbal fluency, which is an ability of executive functions indirectly
trained during the intervention. Moreover, an improvement was
also noticed in episodic verbal memory. Results from other
studies of computer-based programs support that PC training
is beneficial for people with MCI[57] and potentially leads to
generalization of cognitive effect when these programs are
focusing at specific cognitive abilities.[58,59]

The PP/G and the OR/G also showed improvements in verbal fluency, while the OR/G group showed additional improvement in semantic memory (completion time), WM (digit span),
and verbal memory (learning ability). The OR/G, similar to the
other 2 experimental groups, has generalized the effectiveness
in other cognitive domains that were not trained directly during
the program. Furthermore, as we can notice, the OR/G showed
greatest generalization in more cognitive domains of the
3 groups. A possible explanation may be that although the
3 experimental groups were matched in the majority of
the cognitive functions, the participants recruited for the OR/G
had notably lower performance than the other experimental
groups in the post abilities that showed improvement after the
training (although no statistically significant). Therefore, it is
rational for the OR/G to present larger improvement than the
other groups, since they had greater improvement potentials.
Finally, as regards whether the groups could manage to
transfer the cognitive benefit to real-life conditions, as a part
of our third aim, the PP/G showed improvement in ADL. The
transference of program’s benefit in real life is always the
ultimate goal of every intervention in people with cognitive
deficits and it was achieved for the PP/G This result is also


-----

confirmed from other studies, which support that cognitive
interventions may have an impact on ADLs in people with
MCI.[60,61] The paper and pencil training seems to be more
familiar to the elderly individuals aged 65 and older, since they
use writing for several reasons such as in for remembering their
dates, the list for shopping, or their obligations in everyday life.
Therefore, it is probable that people with MCI allocated in PP/
G showed improvement in daily function, since writing is
strongly connected with their ADLs.

## Limitations of the Study

Our study has 2 basic limitations. The first one concerned the
absence of a second neuropsychological follow-up at least 6
months after the end of the language training. According to our
knowledge, there is little research concerning the duration of
the maintenance of the cognitive benefits yielded from the
language training over time. Therefore, a second follow-up
would be possible to provide more evidence. These results
would be very important, since they could confirm that people
with MCI have potential to benefit from the training and maintain the good results over time, especially when the training is
over. A second limitation of the present study is the small
number of the sample allocated in each group. Therefore, further studies are needed to provide more evidence about the
effectiveness of the language training carried out via different
means of training. The next step of our study would be the
increase of the sample in each group, which may lead to more
reliable conclusions.

## Conclusion

According to our knowledge, till today, there are no studies
assessing the effectiveness of a pure language training program
in people with MCI. Our study is the first that demonstrates
evidence regarding the effectiveness of a language training
program, not only to enhance specific language skills but also
to generalize the primary trained benefit in cognitive domains,
not directly trained for people with MCI.
Besides the fact that it was not possible in our study to give
strong evidence concerning which language training format
(PC/G, PP/G, OR/G) is the most effective, however, it provides
evidence that when the training is performed via paper and
pencil or orally, it is more probable for the participants to show
improvement in many more cognitive abilities than computerbased training improvements could offer. As our study
showcased, the paper and pencil version was more effective
regarding the transfer of the cognitive benefit to ADL. This is
likely due to the fact that older people do not consider
computers as part of their lives. Although the computerbased cognitive training in MCI is usual nowadays and its
effectiveness is well established, more studies are necessary
in order to investigate the effectiveness of this means of
training in comparison to the traditional one. Despite the fact
that the use of computer-based cognitive training is a low-cost
solution and is recommended for people who do not have


access to day care centers, the paper and pencil tasks and the
personal interaction between the psychologist and the
participant seem to play an important role for the program’s
effectiveness.
