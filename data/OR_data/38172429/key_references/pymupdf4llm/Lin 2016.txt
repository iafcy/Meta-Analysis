### Abstract


**Background/Objectives—Vision-based speed of processing (VSOP) training is a promising**
cognitive intervention for older adults. However, it is unknown whether VSOP training can affect
cognitive processing in individuals at high risk for dementia. Here, we examined cognitive and
neural effects of VSOP training in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI)
and contrasted those effects with an active control (mental leisure activities; MLA).


**Design—A randomized single-blinded controlled pilot trial.**

**Setting—An academic medical center.**

**Participants—Twenty-one participants with aMCI.**


**Intervention—A 6-week computerized VSOP training.**

**Measurements—Multiple cognitive processing measures, instrumental activities of daily**
living (IADL), and two key resting state neural networks regulating cognitive processing: central
executive network (CEN) and default mode network (DMN).

**Results—We found that, compared to MLA control, VSOP training led to significant**
improvements in trained (processing speed and attention: F1,19 = 6.61, Partial η[2] = 0.26, p = .019)
and untrained cognitive domains (working memory: F1,19 = 7.33, Partial η[2] = 0.28, p = .014;
IADL: F1,19 = 5.16, Partial η[2] = 0.21, p = .035), and protective maintenance in DMN (F1, 9 =
14.63, Partial η[2] = 0.62, p = .004). Additionally, VSOP training, but not MLA, resulted in a
significant improvement in CEN connectivity (Z = −2.37, p = .018).

**Conclusion—We identified both target and transfer effects of VSOP training and revealed**
links between VSOP training and two key neural networks associated with aMCI. These findings
highlight the potential of VSOP training to slow cognitive decline in aMCI. Further delineation of
mechanisms underlying VSOP-induced plasticity is necessary to understand in what populations
and conditions such training may be most effective.

### INTRODUCTION

Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), especially the multiple-domain subtype, is
considered a symptomatic pre-Alzheimer’s disease (AD) phase,[1] and reflects a period when
the underlying pathobiology may be more receptive to modulation than in AD. Notably,
individuals with MCI are highly motivated to engage in activities to maintain cognitive and
functional independence.[2]


One promising intervention is vision-based speed of processing (VSOP) training, a cognitive
intervention widely used in community-dwelling older adults free of AD.[3, 4] VSOP training
primarily addresses visual processing speed and attention, which support most higher-order
cognitive functions[5] and predict both aMCI incidence and progression to AD.[6] A few weeks
of VSOP training has been shown to improve multiple cognitive domains and/or everyday
function in normal aging,[3, 7, 8] HIV,[9] and Parkinson’s disease.[10] Moreover, individuals with
lower baseline cognition are able to experience greater cognitive benefits from training.[11 ]

Taken together, these findings suggest that VSOP training might be particularly beneficial
for individuals with aMCI. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated beneficial effects of VSOP
training on trained domains (i.e., processing speed and attention) across different MCI
subtypes.[12] It is unknown, however, whether the effects of VSOP training in aMCI transfer
on untrained cognitive and functional domains, which is the standard for evaluating the
generalizability of improvement in training.

Recent research suggests that neuroplasticity — the brain’s ability to undergo beneficial
restructuring or reprogramming in response to environmental stimuli — may be induced in
later life, even in aMCI.[13] Evidence for neuroplasticity can indicate that the effects of
training are not limited to cognitive operations (e.g., increasing task fluency). In healthy
older adults, a recent VSOP intervention study showed significant improvement in eventrelated potential waveforms associated with processing speed and attention.[14] Here, we
focus on investigating plasticity in neural markers of neurodegeneration as such plasticity
might indicate ways to modify AD pathology. Growing evidence conceptualizes AD as a
neural connectivity syndrome.[15] Central executive network (CEN) and default mode
network (DMN) are critical in maintaining visual processing speed and attention, and are
susceptible to both normal and abnormal aging processes, including MCI.[5, 16] CEN includes
the dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insula, striatum, and the posterior and
anterior cingulate gyri. This network directs engagement in tasks with high executive
working load and error feedback.[17] DMN includes the posterior cingulate cortex,
ventromedial prefrontal cortex, lateral occipital cortex, hippocampus, and middle temporal
cortex. DMN is related to memory encoding and storage.[18] These networks are typically
studied using resting state functional connectivity (rsFC), which examines task-independent,
spontaneous fluctuations in functional connectivity to reveal brain networks where
information is continuously processed and transported between structurally and functionally
linked brain regions.[19] Recent studies found that, compared to their healthy counterparts,
aMCI is associated with weaker connectivity in DMN and stronger connectivity in
CEN.[17, 20, 21] Similar rsFC changes were also associated with increased beta-amyloid
deposition in older adults, further suggesting that DMN and CEN are sensitive to AD
pathology.[20] To our knowledge, there are no studies examining VSOP training’s effect on
rsFC in aMCI.


In sum, this pilot trial addressed two unresolved questions in the VSOP training literature in
relation to dementia prevention: (1) whether VSOP training in aMCI would transfer to
untrained cognitive domains and (2) whether VSOP training could be linked to resting state
neural networks.[3, 4] These questions are important for establishing clinical relevance of
VSOP training and better understanding VSOP-induced neuroplasticity. We hypothesized
that, compared to MLA, VSOP training would lead to greater and broader cognitive
improvements and more efficient rsFC (i.e., decreased CEN and increased DMN
connectivity).

### METHODS


**Participants**

We conducted a randomized controlled single-blinded trial. Participants with aMCI were
recruited from University of Rochester Memory Care Program (MCP) using the clinical
diagnosis of “mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease.”[1] All participants had
deficits in memory and executive function based on a comprehensive neuropsychological
battery but intact basic activities of daily living, and absence of dementia using NIA-AA
criteria per assessments at MCP. Other inclusion criteria included stable use of AD
medication, capacity to give consent based on clinician assessment, age ≥60 years, English

speaking, adequate visual acuity for testing, and being community-dwelling. Exclusion
criteria included participation in another cognitive intervention study, and active treatment
with antidepressants or anxiolytics.

The study was approved by the University of Rochester Research Subject Review Board.
Twenty-four participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to the VSOP or MLA group
after informed consent and baseline assessment. Cognitive function and rsFC were assessed
at baseline and post-training. Interviewers were blinded to the participants’ group
assignment. Three participants (2 from the VSOP group) withdrew after baseline assessment
due to health issues unrelated to the current study. The baseline characteristics of the
remaining 21 participants did not significantly differ between the two groups (see Table 1).


**Intervention**

VSOP training used the INSIGHT online program (Posit Science) which included five
training tasks: Eye for detail, Peripheral challenge, Visual sweeps, Double decision, and
Target tracker.[14] Across tasks, participants responded either by identifying what object they
saw or where they saw it on the screen. The training automatically adjusted the task
difficulty and speed based on the participant’s performance, ensuring that the participants
always operated near their optimal capacity. The completion percentage and score of each
task were recorded. Training performance was calculated relative to the normative data in
Posit Science database that have completed these same configurations and expressed as a
percentile. As expected, VSOP training resulted in significant performance increases (pretraining mean and standard deviation: 34.4% (13.2%); post-training: 52.2% (16.5%);
Wilcoxon test: Z = −2.81, p = .005).


MLA control activities were chosen to: 1) control for computer/online experience, and
amount of time; 2) simulate participants’ everyday mental activities; and 3) entertain
participants to prevent dropping out. Online crossword, Sudoku, and solitaire games were
used.[3] Participants could choose to practice any combination of these games.

Both groups were asked to practice 1 hour/day, 4 days/week, for 6 weeks in their homes.
Hours spent on training tasks were recorded in both groups; no significant differences were
found (VSOP: 15.44 hours (6.56); MLA: 19.27 (8.11), t20 = −1.14, p = .27). There were no
correlations between training duration and training effects reported below in the entire
sample (all p > .10). In VSOP training studies of healthy older adults, typical training
duration is around 10 hours.[3, 11, 14] Thus, even with a portion of participants that did not
complete all of our training, we ended up with a favorably comparable amount of training
(~15h).


**Outcome Measures**

**Cognitive measures—The Useful Field of View (UFOV) is a computerized test**
assessing visual processing speed and attention. Visual and attentional demands of UFOV
are similar (although not identical) to the task demands in VSOP training [22]. A composite
score of UFOV was developed by averaging the reaction times across three individual tasks

(processing speed, selective attention, and divided attention). The use of the composite score
is consistent with the approach used in other clinical trials.[3, 4]

The EXAMINER is a computerized test designed for clinical trials, measuring three
executive function domains: cognitive control (set shifting and flanker tasks), verbal fluency
(phonemic and categorical fluency), and working memory (dot counting and 1-back). This
three-domain model was determined using confirmatory factor analysis and the generation
of composite scores was based on item response theory methods (for a detailed description
see Chapter 11 in the User Manual [23]). EXAMINER uses several comparable assessment
packages to avoid using identical tests at different assessment points.[24]


TIADL objectively measures performance speed and accuracy on multiple IADL domains. It
is more sensitive than the traditional self-report instruments in detecting subtle decline in
everyday function in persons with MCI.[25] Time spent on each task was recorded with
adjustment on whether an individual accurately completed each task. Detailed description of
the scoring process is available in a previous study.[26] Average completion time across the
tasks was used as the outcome measure.

Neuroimaging data were acquired on a Siemens TimTrio 3T MRI system (Siemens,
Erlangen, Germany) using a 32-channel head coil. High-resolution T1 weighted structural
images were acquired using MPRAGE (TI = 950 ms, TE/TR = 3.87 ms/1,620 ms, 1mm[3 ]

resolution). A 2D axial fast Gradient-Recalled Echo pulse sequence was used to generate
field maps, which was used to correct for field inhomogeneity distortions in echo-planar
imaging sequences. Two 5-min BOLD functional scans were acquired for each assessment
period, using a gradient echo-planar imaging sequence (TR = 2s, TE = 30ms, 4mm[3 ]


resolution, 30 axial slices). Participants were instructed to relax with their eyes open without
falling asleep.

[rsFC data were analyzed using the FSL software (FMRIB Software Library; http://](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/)
[fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/). Data preprocessing consisted of motion correction, slice-](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/)
timing correction, non-brain signal removal and Gaussian spatial smoothing (5mm FWHM).
Nuisance parameters (global, white matter and CSF signals, motion) were removed through
linear regression. Non-neuronal contributions were reduced with temporal filtering (0.01–
0.08 Hz). MELODIC algorithm was used to generate resting state networks. DMN and CEN
networks were identified based on previous literature.[27] Network specific regions of interest
(ROI) were selected using the Harvard-Oxford Atlas. Correlation of time courses between
all possible pairs of within-network ROIs were computed and Fisher Z-transformed, with the
average correlation coefficient representing the strength of the network.


Other data analysis was conducted using SPSS 21.0. To examine group differences at
baseline, independent t-test or χ[2] test was conducted for continuous and categorical
variables, respectively. To examine within-group effects of training, Wilcoxon test was
conducted. Baseline cognitive and neural outcomes did not significantly differ between two
groups except that VSOP training had worse working memory (p = .028). To examine
between-groups effects of training, repeated measure general linear model was conducted;
the main and interacted terms of time and group was examined when controlling for baseline

differences. For reported p- values, false-discovery rate was used to address for multiple
comparisons across outcomes.


We based our sample size on a previous VSOP training study of multiple-domain amnestic
MCI, which reported an effect size (η[2]) = 0.37 when comparing post-training UFOV with a
no-contact control group.[12] From this result, we estimated that the minimum total sample
size would be 14 (based on: α = .05, power = .80, 2 groups, 2 repeated measures, and .50
correlation between repeated measures). This compares favorably with our total sample size
of 21.

### RESULTS


**Training effects on trained and transferred cognitive outcomes**

We first examined within-group cognitive changes (Figure 1 A&B, Table 2), contrasting
baseline and post-training outcomes. For the VSOP group, we found significant
improvements in the trained domain (UFOV, Z = −2.70, p = .007) and two transfer domains
(working memory: Z = 2.31, p = .021, and IADL: Z = −2.29, p = .022), but no significant
changes in two other transfer domains (verbal fluency and cognitive control). For the MLA
group, there were no significant improvements (all p > .10).


The same pattern of results was evident in between-group comparisons (Figure 1 A&B,
Table 2). Namely, compared to MLA, the VSOP group exhibited significant improvements
in UFOV (group-by-time interaction F1,19 = 6.61, Partial η[2] = 0.26, p = .019), working
memory (group-by-time interaction F1, 19 = 7.33, Partial η[2] = 0.28, p = .014), and IADL
(group-by-time interaction F1, 19 = 5.16, Partial η[2] = 0.21, p = .035).


**Training effects on resting state neural networks**

For the VSOP group, we found a significant improvement in CEN connectivity (Z = −2.37,
p = .018, as indexed by reduced connectivity strength) and no change in DMN (Figure 1C,
Table 2). The MLA group showed no CEN changes and trend for worsening of DMN (Z =
1.83, p = .068, as indexed by reduced strength of connectivity). Between-group analysis
(Figure 1C, Table 2) showed that, compared to MLA control, VSOP training resulted in
significant improvements (indexed by increased connectivity) of DMN (group-by-time
interaction F1, 9 = 14.63, Partial η[2] = 0.62, p = .004), but not in CEN.


Summary of the results is presented in Table 2.


### DISCUSSION

The present study shows that, in addition to the improvement in the trained domain, VSOP
training led to improvements in working memory and IADL. The results also link VSOP
training with the maintenance of DMN connectivity strength and decreased CEN
connectivity.


The transfer of VSOP training to untrained cognitive and functional domains is of likely
clinical significance. There may be several non-exclusive explanations of this transfer effect.

J Am Geriatr Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 June 01.


-----

First, as individuals with MCI have low baseline cognitive capacity, they have more room for
improvement both in the trained and untrained domains. Second, VSOP training used here
includes a rich combination of visual processing speed and attention tasks (see Methods).
This is in contrast to previous studies that usually relied on a single task.[7] However, transfer
effects of the training still exhibited a certain degree of specificity. For example, we did not
find significant changes in verbal fluency, which is likely due to the lack of linguistic stimuli
in the training tasks. The specificity of transfer effects across different executive function
domains requires further investigation with larger sample size.

The two brain networks examined in the present study provide a possible functional platform
for disseminating training effects from one region to another. VSOP training in MCI was
linked with reduced CEN connectivity and maintenance of DMN connectivity. One
explanation for the reduced CEN connectivity is that VSOP training helped enhance the
efficiency of information processing, which reduced the frontal lobe-oriented dependence.
Turning to DMN, weakening of DMN connectivity is a consistently identified marker for
neurodegeneration.[28] Although the VSOP training did not enhance DMN connectivity, the
maintenance of DMN connectivity can be viewed as a positive outcome given naturally
worsening processes in MCI. Supporting this argument, we found a trend for weakened
DMN connectivity in the MLA group. This is not surprising, since a recent cohort study
found MLA to be independent from brain pathology. [29]


Limitations of the study need to be acknowledged. First, this study was designed to
investigate VSOP-training induced changes in various cognitive and neural measures. While
our sample size provided sufficient power to examine training-induced changes, it was
insufficient to examine correlations among various cognitive domains and indexes of neural
changes. Whether the cognitive changes correspond to neural changes is critical in linking
the cognitive and neural effects, and needs to be addressed in future studies with larger
sample size. Second, although the five tasks within VSOP training share similar visual
components, we did not specify training effects of individual tasks (similar to other cognitive
training studies [16]). This will also require a much larger sample size. Third, although there
were no significant differences in the training duration between groups, this does not ensure
that the “intensity” of the training is equated. Future research should determine whether, and
to what degree, training intensity differences accounted for differences in the effects of
VSOP and MLA training.
