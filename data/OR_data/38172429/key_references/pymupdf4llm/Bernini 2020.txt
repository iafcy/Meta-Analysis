**Abstract**
**Background The effectiveness of computer-based cognitive training (CCT) remains controversial, especially in older adults**
with neurodegenerative diseases.
**Aims To evaluate the efficacy of CCT in patients with Parkinson’s disease and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI).**
**Methods In this randomized controlled trial, 53 patients were randomized to receive CCT delivered by means of CoRe**
software, traditional paper-and-pencil cognitive training (PCT), or an unstructured activity intervention (CG). In each group,
the intervention lasted 3 consecutive weeks (4 individual face-to-face sessions/week). Neuropsychological assessment was
administered at baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1). Outcome measures at T0 and T1 were compared within and between
groups. The Montreal Overall Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was taken as the primary outcome measure.
**Results Unlike the PCT group and the CG, the patients receiving CCT showed significant medium/large effect size improve-**
ments in MoCA performance, global cognition, executive functions, and attention/processing speed. No baseline individual/
demographic variables were associated with greater gains from the intervention, although a negative correlation with baseline
MoCA performance was found.
**Conclusion CCT proved effective in PD-MCI patients when compared with traditional PCT. Further follow-up assess-**
ments are being conducted to verify the retention of the gains and the potential ability of the tool to delay conversion to
PD-dementia.

Cognitive training (CT) is a non-pharmacological intervention that has long been used to target cognition in a range
of neurological disorders, including age-related cognitive
decline [1–3]. CT can be delivered using traditional paperand-pencil techniques (PCT) or by means of more innovative
computer-based solutions (CCT). With respect to traditional
PCT, CCT provides real-time feedback, allows modulation
of task complexity and response time during and across sessions, requires less exercise preparation (therefore saving
therapists time), and allows recording of all session parameters. Finally, CCT, requiring less face-to-face training, can

be delivered remotely, as a telemedicine intervention, to
patients at home [4].
CCT seems to be efficacious in the early phases of cognitive decline, and particularly in cases of mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) [5, 6]; however, this evidence refers
mainly to MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease. To date, few
studies have focused on Parkinson’s disease (PD) (see [7–13]
for review), and even fewer on PD patients with MCI (PDMCI) [2, 14]. Since motor difficulties can potentially interfere with PD patients’ participation in cognitive interventions, CCT may be particularly suitable for them, as the tools
used can be developed to be user-friendly even for patients
with motor and visuo-spatial difficulties [2, 14]. However,
more and better-designed RCTs are needed to examine the
usability and usefulness of CCT in PD-MCI patients.
In recent years, we implemented a software tool for cognitive rehabilitation called “CoRe” [4, 15, 16]. CoRe is an
adaptive CCT program for individual face-to-face sessions
between patient and therapist. In a previous study, we preliminarily tested its usability and safety as a clinical tool in
dementia-related disorders with a view to optimizing it and
making it easier for patients to use [16]. In another study,
we demonstrated its effectiveness in single-domain training targeting logical-executive functions in PD-MCI inpatients [4]. However, considering the importance of multidomain interventions, designed to produce broader effects
across different cognitive domains [2], we here adopted an
extended version of CoRe. The new version is a patienttailored, multi-domain CT tool targeting logical-executive
functions, attention/processing speed, working memory, and
episodic memory.
The main aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of this
extended version of CoRe in PD-MCI patients using an RCT
design. To this end, we compared this CCT intervention with
the same stimulation activities delivered using a traditional
PCT approach, and with an active control group (CG). The
comparison of the CCT with the PCT group was intended
to provide evidence on the efficacy of computer-based versus paper-and-pencil activities, and the comparison of these
two groups with the CG to provide useful information on
the importance of structured versus unstructured cognitive
activities. Finally, we also explored the role of individual
differences (e.g., age, education, cognitive reserve) in training gains to predict which patients may benefit most from
CCT [17].

### Materials and methods

#### Participants and measures

Patients with idiopathic PD were recruited (March
2017–December 2019) from the Neurorehabilitation Unit

## 1 3


at the C. Mondino Foundation. The protocol was approved
by the local ethics committee and all patients gave written
consent before being enrolled in the study. The inclusion
criteria were:

- a diagnosis of idiopathic PD according to the UKPDBB
criteria and a Hoehn & Yahr scale score ≤ 3 [18, 19];

- the presence of single- or multiple-domain PD-MCI [20];

- age between 50 and 85 years;

- educational level ≥ 5 years.

The exclusion criteria were:

- cognitive impairment due to a pre-existing neurological
condition;

- concomitant severe psychiatric disease (e.g. depression,
psychosis, behavioral disorders);

- concomitant severe non-neurological comorbidities (e.g.
cardiovascular, metabolic and/or endocrinological diseases);

- severe sensory or motor disturbances liable to interfere
with the intervention;

- deep brain stimulation.

All patients were treated with dopamine agonists or
L-DOPA and had been on a stable therapeutic regimen for
at least 3 months. No changes in medication were allowed
during the training and follow-up period. In accordance with
the Movement Disorder Society Task Force guidelines (level
II criteria) [20], the PD-MCI diagnosis was formulated on
the basis of a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation
designed to assess, using the instruments listed below, the
following five cognitive domains:

1. global cognition: Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) and Montreal Overall Cognitive Assessment
(MoCA) [21, 22];
2. episodic long-term memory: Logical Memory Test,
immediate and delayed recall [23, 24], Rey’s 15 word
test, immediate and delayed recall [25], and Rey Complex Figure, delayed recall [26];
3. logical-executive functions: Raven’s Matrices 1947 [25],
the Frontal Assessment Battery [27], semantic fluency

[28], phonological fluency [25], and Rey Complex Figure, copy [26];
4. working memory: Verbal Span, Digit Span, Corsi’s
block-tapping test span [23];
5. attention/processing speed: Attentive Matrices [23],
Trail Making Test (A and B) [29].

At post-intervention (T1), we used the same neuropsychological battery; parallel versions were applied when
available. All the raw scores were adjusted for age, sex, and


-----

education, and compared with the values available for the
Italian population; the adjusted scores were then transformed
into equivalent scores [30].
At baseline (T0), we also assessed mood using the Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI) [31], functional status using the
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL) [32],
and cognitive reserve using the Cognitive Reserve Index
questionnaire (CRIq) [33].

#### Study design and procedures

This study is a prospective double-blind 3-arm RCT. All
PD-MCI patients recruited underwent T0 assessment performed using the above-listed tests. Patients who met the
inclusion criteria were enrolled and randomized to one of
three groups: CCT, PCT, or CG. For the patient allocation,
we generated random numbers from a uniform distribution
in the range 0–1, dividing the range in three equal intervals
and assigning each patient to the group corresponding to
the sampled number. In all groups, the intervention took
place in the Neuropsychology Lab and lasted 3 weeks (4
face-to-face individual sessions/week, each lasting 45 min).
Cognitive outcomes were measured at T0 and T1 by a neuropsychologist who was blinded to the patient allocation.
Further follow-ups will be conducted by December 2020.
All neuropsychological assessments and training sessions
were administered exclusively during “on” status.

#### Interventions

CoRe (acronym for cognitive rehabilitation) is a software
tool developed within a research project. The extended
version of CoRe (with respect to [4]) used in the present
study administers 11 tasks targeting several cognitive abilities (e.g., logical-executive functions, attention/processing
speed, working memory, and episodic memory; for details
see Online Resource 1). Most of these tasks are computerized versions of existing paper-and-pencil exercises. Others were created to meet specific requirements expressed by
the therapists and to exploit computer functionalities that
would be particularly difficult to reproduce with a paperand-pencil approach. During the dynamic generation of the
exercises, the individual patient’s performance data (accuracy and number of clues required) were analyzed to set
the appropriate difficulty level. For each exercise and each
level, thresholds are defined so as to allow difficulty levels
to be progressively increased. Moreover, CoRe computed a
performance indicator, the weighted score (WS) [16], which
was calculated taking into account different parameters: type
of exercise, difficulty level, accuracy, response time. The
WS, used to assess both the overall outcome of a session and
the global trend of the rehabilitation, served to summarize
each patient’s performance in a single value.


The PCT group followed the same training program as the
CCT group, but using the paper-and-pencil version of the
tasks. Computer tasks not reproducible in the context of the
PCT approach were substituted by equivalent tasks training
the same skills. In PCT, the dynamic aspect of the training
(i.e. the increasing levels of difficulty) was managed by the
therapist (who spent around 4 h/patient on preparation of
appropriate PCT material).
The CG subjects did unstructured activities (e.g., reading
magazines, chatting, drawing) that served as a behavioral
placebo treatment.

#### Statistical analysis

The primary outcome measure was global cognitive functioning assessed using the MoCA, while the secondary
outcome measures were performances in the five cognitive
domains. To obtain a score for each domain, we calculated,
in each group, the sum of the equivalent scores of all the
tests and then divided the total by the number of tests. The
sample size was based on the primary outcome. A power
analysis indicated that a total sample size of 39 patients
would be sufficient to detect an effect size of 0.3, with 90%
power at 5% level of statistical significance. The data were
analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle and
including only those of participants who completed the
study. Considering the small sample size, normality tests
could not be expected to give reliable results, so non-parametric tests were preferred. The Kruskal–Wallis test was
used for inter-group comparisons of participant characteristics and training gains (i.e., T1 minus T0). Significant differences were then evaluated using the Wilcoxon signedrank test, which was also used for intra-group comparisons
between T0 and T1. An effect size index (Cohen’s d) was
calculated to measure the magnitude of the training effect
for each significant difference within each group. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was also used within the CCT group
to evaluate changes in the WS from session 1 to session 12.
Finally, Spearman’s correlations were used to detect associations between individual characteristics and training gains
in global cognitive functioning, as reflected in the MoCA
score, our primary outcome measure. To this end, only the
CCT and PCT groups were considered, given that the CG
did no structured activity. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software ver. 23.0.

### Results

Fifty-three PD patients were enrolled. Of these, 21 were randomly assigned to CCT, 14 to PCT, and 18 to CG activities.
In the CCT and PCT groups, 3 and 2 patients, respectively,
dropped out because they were discharged before the end

Demographic and clinical characteristics at T0 are
reported in Table 1. No baseline difference was found
between the three groups: age (χ[2] = 4.68, p = 0.10, df = 2),
education (χ[2] = 1.90, p = 0.38, df = 2), gender (χ[2] = 1.04,


_p = 0.59, df = 2), disease duration (χ[2] = 4.52,_ _p = 0.10,_

(χ[2] = 1.35, p = 0.51, df = 2). The only exception was BDI
(χ[2] = 11.13, p = 0.004, df = 2); the CG had significantly
lower scores than the CCT (Z = 2.617, p = 0.009) and PCT
(Z = 2.964, p = 0.003) groups, whose scores were similar
(Z = 1.634, p = 0.10).
Analysis of T0 data was carried out on mean performance
scores for the five cognitive domains considered. Internal
consistency for these domains (Cronbach’s α) was moderate, probably due to the multifaceted complexity of each
ability: global cognition (α = 0.54), episodic long-term
memory (α = 0.47), logical-executive functions (α = 0.51),
working memory (α = 0.69), and attention/processing speed
(α = 0.58). No baseline differences were found between
groups: global cognition (χ[2] = 2.38, p = 0.31, df = 2), episodic long-term memory (χ[2] = 3.50, p = 0.17, df = 2), logical-executive functions (χ[2] = 4.99, p = 0.08, df = 2), working
memory (χ[2] = 3.59, p = 0.17, df = 2), and attention/processing speed (χ[2] = 1.99, p = 0.37, df = 2).

No significant differences were found in the episodic longterm memory or working memory domains.


The PCT group showed no significant differences

The analysis of training gains is reported in Table 4 (see
Online Resource 2 for corresponding means and standard
deviations).
The three groups differed significantly in the MoCA,
global cognition, and attention/processing speed domains.
The CCT group, compared with the PCT patients, recorded
significantly better MoCA and global cognition domain performances, whereas they showed similar training gains in
the other domains. Compared with the CG, the CCT group
recorded greater training gains on the MoCA and global
cognition and attention/processing speed. These pairs of


groups showed similar training gains in episodic long-term
memory, logical-executive functions, and working memory.
When comparing the PCT group and the CG, no significant
differences emerged, with the exception of attention/processing speed, where the PCT patients did better than the CG.
With regard to the WS, computed by the CoRe software,
the CCT group showed a significant improvement from session 1 to session 12 (Z = 3.724, p < 0.001) (see Fig. 4).
On analysis of possible correlations between individual
patient characteristics and training gains, MoCA gains correlated negatively with baseline performance (r = − 0.54,

### Discussion

Our results showed positive effects of CCT compared with
other interventions. On within-group analysis, the CCT
patients showed medium/large effect size changes from T0
to T1 both in global cognitive functioning (MoCA score),
which was our primary outcome measure, and in some secondary outcomes. No significant improvement was observed
in the PCT or CG patients. Furthermore, the between-group
analysis confirmed that the CCT-induced improvements
were statistically different from the trends recorded in the
other groups. In particular, the CCT patients had significantly larger training gains than the PCT ones on the MoCA
and in the global cognition domain. When compared with
the CG intervention, CCT induced significantly larger gains
on the MoCA, and in the global cognition and attention/processing speed domains. On the other hand, the comparison
of the PCT with the CG results confirmed the importance of
structured cognitive activities with respect to unstructured
ones, given that PCT was associated with significantly larger
training gains in the attention/processing speed domain.
Since our neuropsychological assessments included tests
that were not part of the training activities, our results may
reflect training-related effects rather than consequences of
simple practice. With regard to the neuropsychological test,
we used as the primary outcome, it is worth remarking that
the MoCA is considered the most appropriate screening test
for detecting global cognitive functioning in PD [34]. Some
authors used the MMSE [35, 36], others the ACE-R [37,
38]. In this research, we administered both the MMSE and
the MoCA, which were considered as separate measures
and also combined in a composite index of global cognition. Our results showed an overall effect of CoRe on global
cognitive level (both on the MoCA and on the composite
index of global cognition), as also observed in [4]. It is
noted that the baseline MoCA score in the CCT group was
slightly, although not significantly, lower than that of the
PCT group. The fact that the CCT also showed greater gains
in other cognitive domains further reinforces the superiority of the computer-based training. Another consideration
is that the CCT patients tended to have a shorter (albeit not
significantly shorter) disease duration. It could, therefore,
be argued that these patients might be more likely to show
greater gains from cognitive training, independently of the
treatment. However, the fact that disease duration was not


found to correlate with training gains seems to confute this
hypothesis.
CoRe is a multi-domain training tool. Our analysis
revealed training gains with large effect size mainly in the
logical-executive functions and attention/processing speed
domains, but less impact of the training on memory. In PDMCI patients, executive functions are the most affected and
probably the most sensitive to treatment effects. Furthermore, different domains need different degrees of stimulation, in terms of duration and frequency. From this perspective, it would be interesting to explore the effect of this CCT
approach in other patients with different cognitive dysfunction profiles.
As for the influence of demographic/individual differences [17], none of the variables considered correlated
with training gains, except for a negative association with
baseline cognitive status measured by MoCA. This is in line
with the “compensation model”, which postulates that people with lower initial cognitive status tend to benefit more
from the intervention because it allows them to compensate
for their difficulties. In other words, participants with lower
baseline performance and cognitive resources would have
more room for improvement [39].
Our experience with CCT highlighted its multiple advantages, for therapists and patients, over traditional approaches.
First, CCT allows more adaptive and patient-tailored training. Second, it is time-saving for the therapist—the CCT
tool was ready to use, whereas the therapists spent 20 min/
session per PCT patient on setting exercises, which amounts
to about 48 h for just 12 patients. CoRe also records session
parameters, whereas PCT per se does not allow recording
of any session parameter. The time saved with CCT could
be used to intensify the training sessions, or to provide more
patients with treatment. Third, as CCT automatically records
data, it offers the possibility of calculating a performance
indicator (the WS) that summarizes the performance of a
single patient or group. It is also worth noting the very high
percentage of completed sessions, the good usability of the
tool, and the patients’ confidence when using it, reported
during the sessions. All these are points in favor of the system [16].
This study has some limitations. First, the number of
patients randomized to the three groups was unbalanced.
This is due to the relatively small total number of patients
enrolled (n = 53). Randomized allocation of 53 cases to three
groups is inherently very likely (the probability is around
26%) to result in such an imbalance. Second, the study
lacks follow-up assessments; therefore, we could not verify
the retention of the effects of the treatment or the potential
ability of CCT to delay conversion of PD-MCI into PDdementia. Follow-up data are currently being collected and
will be the topic of a future publication. Third, we observed
selective drop-out in the CCT and PCT groups, due to the

discharge of some patients before the end of the treatment.
This might be considered a violation of the intention-totreat principle, which may have biased the results. However, these discharges were linked to routine clinical practice
procedures or to personal reasons unrelated to the patients’
cognitive problems, and they were not due to the desire to
discontinue the treatment.
CoRe is currently a research tool, available for use by
other health professionals with a view to sharing experiences. Cognitive training performed using the CoRe software could usefully be incorporated into routine clinical
protocols as a non-pharmacological complementary therapy. With adequate adaptations, CoRe-based CCT could be
repeated over time and also used remotely at home, thereby
broadening its therapeutic potential and the number of
beneficiaries.
