Objective: The aim of this paper was to assess the efficacy of process-based cognitive training (pb-CT)
combined with reminiscence therapy (RT) in patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease (mAD) and mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) and in healthy elderly (HE) subjects.

Methods: This multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involved 348 participants with mAD, MCI, and HE
from four European countries. Participants were randomly assigned to two arms of a crossover design: those
in arm A underwent 3months of computerized pb-CT for memory and executive functions combined with
RT and 3months of rest; those in arm B underwent the reverse. The primary outcome was the effect of the
training on memory and executive functions performance. The secondary outcome was the effect of the
training on functional abilities in mAD assessed with the instrumental activities of daily living.

Results: We found a significant effect of the training for memory in all three groups on delayed recall of
the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test and for executive functions in HE on the phonological fluency
test. MCI and HE participants maintained these effects at follow-up. MCI and mAD participants also
showed a significant effect of the training on the Mini-mental state examination scale. Participants with
mAD showed more stable instrumental activities of daily living during the training versus the rest period.

Conclusions: Our results corroborate the positive effect of pb-CT and its maintenance primarily on
memory in HE and MCI participants that did not seem to be potentiated by RT. Moreover, our results
are very promising for the mAD participants. Copyright # 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Introduction

Cognitive decay is associated with physiological aging
(Hedden and Gabrieli, 2004) and dementia syndromes,
particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The late-life
changes characterizing physiological aging occur


particularly in the frontostriatal system connected with
the medial temporal regions (Hedden and Gabrieli,
2004; Salthouse, 2009), thus involving memory and
executive functions (EFs). Mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) (Petersen et al., 1999; Petersen, 2004) is a condition
in which a cognitive disorder is objectively documented in

the absence of dementia. Particularly, amnestic multidomain MCI is a transitional stage between physiological
aging and AD in more than 50% of cases within 2years
(Gainotti et al., 2014). Indeed, the early stages of AD are
characterized by a significant episodic memory deficit
often associated with EF deficits (Perry and Hodges,
1999; Baddeley et al., 2001). Therefore, memory and
EFs seem to be an eligible target to be treated.
Because pharmacological interventions showed
modest effects (Massoud and Léger, 2011), nonpharmacological approaches received increased attention as a preventive or enhancing treatment (Gates
et al., 2011; Bahar-Fuchs et al., 2013; Lampit et al.,
2014a). These involve different approaches (Lustig
et al., 2009). General cognitive stimulation or individualized rehabilitation protocols (Wilson, 2002) have
shown widespread benefits but often small transfer effects (Lustig et al., 2009). Alternatively, cognitive training (CT) consists of repeated practice on standardized
tasks relying on specific cognitive domains (Gates and
Valenzuela, 2010). This can be distinguished in learning
and practicing memory strategies, that is, strategy-based
CT (sb-CT), and repetitive cognitive exercises without
explicit strategies, that is, process-based CT (pb-CT)
(Lustig et al., 2009; Gates et al., 2011). The sb-CT
showed large benefits but limited transfer effects,
whereas the pb-CT seems to obtain larger transfer effects (Lustig et al., 2009). At present, about 30 reviews
and meta-analyses have evaluated the efficacy of CT in
the healthy elderly (HE; Papp et al., 2009; Valenzuela
and Sachdev, 2009; Gates and Valenzuela, 2010; Martin
et al., 2011; Tardif and Simard, 2011; Kueider et al.,
2012; Reijnders et al., 2013; Kelly et al., 2014; Lampit
et al., 2014a), MCI (Faucounau et al., 2010; Jean et al.,
2010; Gates et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011; Martin et al.,
2011; Huckans et al., 2013; Reijnders et al., 2013; Coyle
et al., 2015), and AD (De Vreese et al., 2001; Clare et al.,
2003; Sitzer et al., 2006; Buschert et al., 2010; Olazarán
et al., 2010; Yamaguchi et al., 2010; Ballard et al., 2011;
Spector et al., 2012; Woods et al., 2012; Bahar-Fuchs
et al., 2013; Herholz et al., 2013). The discrepancies that
emerged in the conclusions were due to the methodological heterogeneity in the studies and, notably, the different intervention protocols. Selecting pb-CT trials for
memory and EFs, we found an average medium positive
effect for memory in HE and MCI and, regarding EFs,
small-medium effects only for HE. AD patients showed
no relevant results for memory and EFs and some positive results for global cognition (Davis et al., 2001; Günther et al., 2003; Loewenstein et al., 2004; Cipriani et al.,
2006; Galante et al., 2007; Rozzini et al., 2007; Talassi
et al., 2007; Peretz et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2013; Shatil,
2013; Lampit et al., 2014b).


Another non-pharmacological approach used in dementia care is the reminiscence therapy (RT) (Woods
et al., 2005). This is a non-specific stimulation activity
consisting of recalling personal past events supported
by memory triggers (e.g., audio-visual materials). Reminiscence is a naturally occurring process initially
adopted in psychotherapy as a “life review” (Butler,
1963), stimulating subjects to review their life by
reflecting on their own experiences. Moreover, RT is
used to train memory. Because the remote memories
are better preserved than recent episodic memories in
both the older and dementia patients, recall mechanisms of the memory system might be stimulated by
using preserved material, thus avoiding frustration. Furthermore, benefits for global cognition have been
shown in dementia patients (Woods et al., 2005; Wang,
2007; Okumura et al., 2008) and in the HE
(Akhoondzadeh et al., 2014; Sok, 2015).
The novelty of our randomized controlled trial
(RCT) is the coupling of a pb-CT with RT. To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of these approaches to protect
late-life cognition. We evaluated the efficacy of a pbCT focused on memory and EFs combined with RT in
a large sample including patients with mild AD
(mAD), during MCI and HE. Another innovative aspect
was the use of a computerized support to administer
both interventions. This offered advantages such as the
availability of feedback and tailoring programs on the
users’ performance (Kueider et al., 2012). Most of the
exercises trained memory and EFs, but we also included
exercises aimed at improving those domains (i.e., orientation, constructional praxis, abstract reasoning, and
language) that might be affected by physiological aging
and AD. RT consisted of producing a storybook in
which participants were guided through their life experiences with questions concerning the entire life cycle.
The primary aim of this study was to evaluate
whether a pb-CT on memory and EFs combined
with RT would provide similar or better findings
on memory and EF outcomes than studies evaluating
pb-CT only. The secondary aim was to determine
whether the effects were maintained at follow-up. A
final aim was to evaluate generalization of the training effects on the functional abilities of mAD.

Methods

Eligibility criteria

Inclusion criteria for participants were age ≥65years
and formal education ≥5years. Participants were

342 F. Barban et al.


divided into three samples according to the following
criteria:

(1) mAD: Subjects satisfying the National Institute of
Neurological and Communicative Disorders and
Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for diagnosis of probable
AD (McKhann et al., 2011) at a mild stage of cognitive impairment and who had a Mini-mental state
examination (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975) score
≥20 and a global score equal to 1 on the Clinical
Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (Hughes et al., 1982)
with a subscore of at least 1 in memory domain; stable antidementia pharmacological treatment for at
least 1month; and presence of a primary caregiver.
(2) MCI: Subjects satisfying the operational criteria
for MCI (Petersen, 2004) with an MMSE (Folstein
et al., 1975) score ≥25 and a global score equal to
0.5 on the CDR (Hughes et al., 1982) with a
subscore of 0.5 in the memory domain and presence of an informant.
(3) HE: Healthy elderly with no history of neurological or psychiatric deficits with an MMSE (Folstein
et al., 1975) score ≥26 and a global score equal to 0
on the CDR (Hughes et al., 1982) and presence of
an informant.

All participants gave their written informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethical committees in the pilot sites.

Study design

We carried out a multicenter RCT by using a stratified
randomization by sample (AD, MCI, and HE) and
center of recruitment. Participants were recruited in
medical centers and municipalities in four countries
(Italy, Greece, Norway, and Spain). Participants were
allocated in two arms according to a crossover design:
arm A, participants began with a training period of
about 3months and then underwent a lengthequivalent period of rest; arm B, participants started
with the rest followed by the training.
All participants were followed up for 6months, and
all outcome assessments were conducted at baseline, at
3months (at the switch between periods), and at
6months (after the study conclusion) by trained raters.

Training

All participants attended 24 one-hour treatment sessions twice weekly for a total of about 3months. Sessions were carried out in groups of up to three
participants under the supervision of a trained


cognitive therapist. Each session was divided into
30min of multi-component pb-CT (10min for memory, 10min for EFs, and 10min for other cognitive domains, i.e., logical reasoning, orientation, language,
and constructional praxis) and 30min of RT during
which participants were asked to answer questions
concerning semantic autobiographical data (e.g., the
name of their primary school) or episodic autobiographical questions (e.g., a nice situation during childhood). The training was administered using a software
that resulted from a project co-funded by the European
[Union (CIP-ICT-PSP) called SOCIABLE (http://www.](http://www.cognitivetraining.eu)
[cognitivetraining.eu) and operating on a touch screen](http://www.cognitivetraining.eu)
computer. This software was designed for individuals
with cognitive impairments as well as for HE. It includes the exercises for the pb-CT and an electronic
book called “Book of Life” for the RT. Exercises trained
are as follows: episodic memory, for example, remembering a list (Galante et al., 2007), remembering object
locations in domestic environments (Schreiber, 1999),
and finding pairs of images (Xeno Rasmusson et al.,
1999; Peretz et al., 2011; Shatil, 2013); attentional
EFs, for example, selective attention by paying attention to stimuli avoiding distractors (Mayas et al.,
2014), and abstraction, explaining similarities (Dubois
et al., 2000; Bergamaschi et al., 2013), categorizing objects (Nelson, 1976), or deducting a target by excluding
the distractors (Gaitán et al., 2013); orientation, for example, moving into a house (Bergamaschi et al., 2013);
logical reasoning (Raven, 1947), for example, completing a visual pattern with a missing element; constructional praxis, for example, doing a puzzle (Peretz
et al., 2011); and language, for example, coupling synonyms or antonyms (see Supporting Information for a
full description). Each exercise featured three progressive difficulty levels adjustable according to users’
performance.

Study outcomes

The primary outcome of the study was the effect of the
training compared with the rest on neuropsychological test scores of memory and EFs. Memory was
assessed with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test
(RAVLT) (Rey, 1958) and the Rey–Osterrieth Complex
Figure Test (Rey, 1941), and EFs were assessed with
the Trail Making Test (Reitan and Wolfson, 1985)
and the Phonological Verbal Fluency Test (Borkowski
et al., 1967). Global cognition was assessed with the
MMSE.
As a secondary outcome (only for the mAD group),
the study included the effect of the training compared

with the rest on functional abilities assessed with the
instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) (Lawton
and Brody, 1969).

Randomization

The randomization of participants between the two
arms of the study was carried out by center and sample
(mAD, MCI, and HE) and with a block size of four to
prevent imbalance between the allocation groups. The
allocation procedure was concealed from the raters.

Statistics

The primary aim of our analyses was to determine (separately for each sample of participants) whether there was a
differential effect between the training and the rest period
for each neuropsychological test. Therefore, we analyzed
the interaction arm×time of a mixed analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with arms (A and B) as between-subjects
factor and time of assessment (baseline, month 3, and
month 6) as within-subjects factor. To account for multiple comparisons, we used a Bonferroni correction of the
significance level of p < 0.05 for the number of measures
tested, resulting in p < 0.008. To account for the equivalence on demographic and primary outcomes between
the two arms of the study (A and B), for each sample,
we calculated Student’s t-test comparisons for continuous
variables and the χ[2] test for sex. We used a Bonferroni
correction of the significance level of p < 0.05 for the
number of measures tested, resulting in p < 0.006. Then
we evaluated the specific effects of the training and rest
periods with post hoc analyses only for significant interactions. We calculated post hoc Student’s t-tests between the
pre-treatment and post-treatment and the pre-rest and
post-rest. To account for multiple comparisons, we used
a Bonferroni correction of the significance level of
p < 0.05 for the number of measures tested, resulting in
p < 0.013. We evaluated the directions of significant effects by calculating Cohen’s d effect size (Cohen, 1992).
Our study was not meant to evaluate a proper follow-up
effect; nevertheless, the participants in arm A first received
the training and then the rest; therefore, we considered
the post-rest assessment as a follow-up. We evaluated
the follow-up effect with Student’s t-tests between baseline and month 6 assessments for subjects of arm A.

Results

Characteristics of participants

A total of 348 participants were randomized, and 301
completed the conclusive assessment (14% dropout)


(Figure 1). Demographics and primary outcomes at
baseline, stratified by sample (HE, MCI, and mAD)
and allocation groups (arm A and arm B), are presented in Table 1.

Primary outcome: cognitive abilities

The ANOVAs (Figure 2) showed a significant
time×arm interaction, indicating a general differential
effect between the treatment and the rest for MMSE
in MCI [F(2,208)=7.572, p =0.001] and mAD

[F(2,158)=6.085, p =0.004], for the memory tests of
RAVLT delayed for all three groups, that is, HE

[F(2,224)=6.362, p =0.002], MCI [F(2,208)=6.041,
p =0.003], and mAD [F(2,158)=8.009, p =0.001], and
for the test of verbal fluency for HE [F(2,224)=5.683,
p =0.006]. We found no significant main effects of
arm except for HE on the Rey–Osterrieth Complex
Figure Test delayed memory test [F(1,112)=15.199,
p < 0.001] in agreement with the significant difference
detected at baseline (Table 1). Conversely, on each
test, the main effect of time was significant for HE

[F(2,224) - 6.547, p < 0.004] with the exception of Trail
Making Test A and for MCI [F(2, 170–208) - 6.043,
p < 0.004]. For mAD, the main effect of time was never
significant.
Table 2 shows results of post hoc Student’s t-test between pre-training/post-training and pre-rest/postrest periods for outcomes that showed significant interactions on ANOVA. The pre-training/post-training
difference in the memory outcome was significant in
almost all groups, whereas pre-rest/post-rest difference
was never significant. We obtained similar results for
the EF outcome in HE and in MMSE scores of MCI

and mAD. We also derived Cohen’s d (Cohen, 1992) of
the training periods showing significant effects
(Table 2). Effects of the training for significant results
of RAVLT delayed recall ranged between 0.26 and
0.48 and for MMSE between 0.30 and 0.53, whereas
phonological fluency was on average 0.17 for HE. Significant positive effects of the training for memory
and EF outcomes were maintained during the following rest period in HE and MCI (Table 2, right
columns).

Secondary outcome: functional abilities in the mild
Alzheimer’s disease sample

Half of our mAD sample (comprising both arms A
and B) (54%, n =41) showed variability on the IADL
at all three time points. In this subsample, we found
a difference approaching significance between the
training and the rest in the ratio between the number
of participants who showed increased/stable IADL
and the number who showed decreased IADL
(χ[2] =3.190, p < 0.07). Specifically, during the training, 68% of the participants showed increased/stable
IADL versus 32% who showed decreased IADL, and
during the rest, 46% of the participants showed
increased/stable IADL versus 54% who showed decreased IADL (Figure 3).

Discussion

This RCT shows a medium positive effect during the
training for episodic verbal memory in all three
groups. HE also showed a small positive effect for
EFs. During the rest, no effects were detected. Furthermore, the MCI and HE subjects’ improvements in
memory and the HE subjects’ improvement in EFs
were maintained during the 3months of post-training
rest. mAD and MCI subjects also showed a positive effect on MMSE scores, not maintained during the rest.
Finally, during the training, mAD showed an approaching significance positive effect on functional
abilities.
The first aim of this study was to evaluate the effect
of the training on memory and EFs. As to memory,
our findings are consistent with the positive results
previously reported in which pb-CT was administered
to HE and MCI, and they are very promising for mAD
when compared with the lack of significant positive
results previously reported in pb-CT studies. Indeed,
two studies in HE (Peretz et al., 2011; Miller et al.,
2013) found positive effects when they compared

pre-pb-CT and post-pb-CT (d =0.33 and d =0.25, respectively). Two other studies (Shatil, 2013; Lampit
et al., 2014b) showed similar effects when they compared the training period with a comparable period
of active placebo (AP) (d =0.64 and d =0.49, respectively). In the former, the placebo showed no effectiveness (d = 0.02) (Shatil, 2013), but in the latter, in
�
which the placebo consisted of a memory task, the placebo showed a small-medium effect (d =0.38) (Lampit
et al., 2014b). Similar results were reported for MCI
subjects (Günther et al., 2003; Cipriani et al., 2006;
Talassi et al., 2007) showing an average positive medium effect (d =0.72, d =0.56, and d =0.31, respectively). Finally, previous studies in AD patients
reported a lack of relevant effects (Heiss et al., 1994;
Davis et al., 2001; Loewenstein et al., 2004; Cipriani
et al., 2006; Galante et al., 2007; Talassi et al., 2007).
Regarding EFs, our HE sample showed a positive
but small effect consistently with two previous similar
studies (Peretz et al., 2011; Shatil et al., 2014) comparing pre-pb-CT and post-pb-CT (d =0.26 and d =0.38,
respectively). By contrast, two other studies (Shatil,


2013; Lampit et al., 2014b) comparing the pb-CT with
an AP reported non-significant results. Our lack of relevant significant effects in MCI and AD patients is
consistent with most previous studies adopting the
pb-CT (Loewenstein et al., 2004; Cipriani et al.,
2006; Galante et al., 2007; Talassi et al., 2007). Indeed,
only Günther et al. (2003) found a small positive effect
(d =0.27) when they compared pre-pb-CT with postpb-CT in MCI.
As to global cognition, our MMSE results in MCI
participants are very promising because previous studies comparing pre-pb-CT with post-pb-CT reported
no significant effects (Cipriani et al., 2006; Talassi
et al., 2007). Conversely, our data on mAD patients
are consistent with previous findings (Cipriani et al.,
2006; Talassi et al., 2007) of a medium-high effect
(d =1.01 and d =0.54, respectively).
Our secondary aim was to determine whether the effects were maintained at the follow-up. Our results suggest that the memory improvements of MCI and HE
and the EF gains in HE were maintained during the
3months post-training. These results agree with those

previously reported showing that cognitive gains in the
HE may last for years (Willis et al., 2006). Indeed, a longitudinal study (Lampit et al., 2014b) in HE subjects
showed a significant medium effect on global cognition
3months post-training (d =0.30) and a small one after
1year (d =0.21). Moreover, a study on MCI (Günther
et al., 2003) showed significant medium effects
5months post-training (d =0.45) for memory. Finally,
a study in mAD (Galante et al., 2007) showed that at
month 9 follow-up, the treated group obtained stable
MMSE scores compared with the untreated patients
who showed a significant decrease.
A final aim was to evaluate the generalization of the
training effects on the functional abilities of the mAD.
Our results are promising when compared with the lack
of positive effects previously reported (Loewenstein
et al., 2004; Galante et al., 2007; Talassi et al., 2007).
In conclusion, our training showed in HE and MCI
subjects positive medium effects on memory after
training that were also maintained at follow-up. Although two recent studies in HE evidenced significant
positive effects after RT on global cognition and memory (Akhoondzadeh et al., 2014; Sok, 2015), in our
study, the addition of RT does not seem to increase
the effectiveness. Indeed, the effects in HE and MCI
participants on memory are similar to those reported
in previous pb-CT trials. Positive medium effects on
memory outcomes were also obtained in mAD. These
are very promising considering the lack of positive results in mAD previously reported and the positive effects also on the functional abilities. Because RT in
moderate-severe AD patients was previously reported
to show positive but non-significant effects on global
cognition (Baines et al., 1987; Thorgrimsen et al.,
2002; Lai et al., 2004), our results might be due to the

combination of RT and pb-CT. Our results are promising but inconclusive because our study did not compare the training with an AP. Indeed, the cognitive
gains of the HE and MCI subjects could not be attributed specifically to CT but to the increased attention
that subjects received because these effects might disappear when compared with an AP (Martin et al.,
2011). Nevertheless, there are indications in the literature that an AP does not improve cognition (van
Muijden et al., 2012; Shatil, 2013) or it shows small effects (Lampit et al., 2014b; Shatil et al., 2014) when the
involvement of an active memory component is present. We are currently evaluating the effect of our pbCT compared with an AP condition not involving
memory (i.e., filling a database). However, another
RCT is needed to separately compare pb-CT, RT, and
their combination with an AP to assess the specificity
of their effectiveness.
Finally, the small effect on EFs limited to HE is partially consistent with previous evidence. Nevertheless,
our protocol was probably unbalanced toward memory
because of the combination of memory pb-CT and RT.
In conclusion, this study is the first attempt to combine pb-CT and RT. In agreement with previous evidence, we found that the training had a positive effect
on memory in mAD, MCI, and HE, and in HE also
on EFs. Further trials are needed to compare single
and combined trainings using an active control condition to assess the specificity of their effectiveness.

Key points

This study demonstrates the positive effect of

# •
combined treatment with cognitive training
and reminiscence therapy on memory in mild
Alzheimer’s disease patients, MCI, and healthy
elderly participants. This positive effect on
memory was maintained during the follow-up
period in MCI and healthy elderly participants.
This study demonstrates the positive effect of

# •
combined treatment with cognitive training and
reminiscence therapy on executive functions in
healthy elderly participants and maintenance of
the effect during the follow-up period.
Mild Alzheimer’s disease patients tended to

# •
maintain more stable functional abilities during the
combined treatment than during the rest period.
