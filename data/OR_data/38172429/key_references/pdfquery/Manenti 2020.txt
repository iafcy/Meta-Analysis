Background: In recent years, the potential usefulness of cognitive training procedures 
in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have received increased attention. 
Objective: The main aim of this study was to evaluate the efﬁcacy of the face-to-face 
cognitive virtual reality rehabilitation system (VRRS) and to compare it to that of face-to- 
face cognitive treatment as usual for individuals with MCI. Moreover, we assessed the 
possibility of prolonging the effects of treatment with a telerehabilitation system. 
Methods: A total of 49 subjects with MCI were assigned to 1 of 3 study groups 
in a randomized controlled trial design: (a) those who received face-to-face cognitive 
VRRS (12 sessions of individualized cognitive rehabilitation over 4 weeks) followed by 
telerehabilitation (36 sessions of home-based cognitive VRRS training, three sessions 
for week); (b) those who received face-to-face cognitive VRRS followed by at-home 
unstructured cognitive stimulation (36 sessions of home-based unstructured cognitive 
stimulation, three sessions for week); and (c) those who received face-to-face cognitive 
treatment as usual (12 sessions of face-to-face cognitive treatment as usual). 
Results: An improvement in memory, language and visuo-constructional abilities was 
observed after the end of 
face-to-face VRRS treatment compared to face-to-face 
treatment as usual. The application of home-based cognitive VRRS telerehabilitation 









seems to induce more maintenance of 
unstructured stimulation. 

Discussion: The present study provides preliminary evidence in support of 
individualized VRRS treatment and telerehabilitation delivery for cognitive rehabilitation 
and should pave the way for future studies aiming at identifying optimal cognitive 
treatment protocols in subjects with MCI.

Antonietti et al., 2016; Vermeij 
O’Connell, 2018; Isernia et al., 2019). 

In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of 
telerehabilitation methods in patients with neurodegenerative 
diseases (Cherney and van Vuuren, 2012; Cotelli et al., 2019). 
Given the limited eﬀectiveness of pharmacological treatments, 
there is a critical need to develop novel interventions aimed at 
preventing or delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) might represent a potential 
target for intervention trials (Kidd, 2008; Hong et al., 2015; 
Janoutova et al., 2015). 
Traditional cognitive training involves intensive in-person 
sessions that may not prove to be feasible and cost-eﬀective in the 
case of large-scale implementation. The average lifespan in the 
world almost doubled during the 20th century and has resulted in 
a large number of people living to old ages, causing an increased 
risk of developing age-related diseases, disability and dementia 
(Fratiglioni et al., 1999; Brown, 2015). In the coming years, the 
growing demand and the need to contain the costs of health 
care will dictate the need to reorganize the services dedicated 
to people at risk of developing cognitive impairment by taking 
advantage of technological developments (Bharucha et al., 2009; 
Astell, 2019; Moyle, 2019). Telerehabilitation via information 
and communication technologies (Brennan et al., 2011; Realdon 
et al., 2016; Pitt et al., 2019) represents an innovative approach to 
overcome the obstacles associated with face-to-face intervention. 
Telerehabilitation technologies allow to provide services remotely 
in patients’ homes or other environments, allowing access to 
health care to patients living in rural settings or with mobility 
diﬃculties (Brennan et al., 2002, 2009, 2011; Forducey et al., 
2003; Mashima and Doarn, 2008; Zampolini et al., 2008; Hailey 
et al., 2011; Peretti et al., 2017). In addition, the telerehabilitation 
modality oﬀers the advantage of providing rehabilitation within 
the natural environment of the patient’s home, making the 
treatment more realistic and possibly more generalizable to the 
person’s daily life (McCue et al., 2010). 
studies have 
application of 



telerehabilitation methodology in individuals with physical 
impairments, post-stroke participants 
and patients with 
neurodegenerative diseases leads to clinical improvements that 
are generally equal to those induced by conventional face-to-face 
rehabilitation programs (Brennan et al., 2002; Rosen, 2004; 
Poon et al., 2005; Mashima and Doarn, 2008; Kairy et al., 
Jelcic et al., 2014; 
2009; Cherney and van Vuuren, 2012; 



eﬃcacy of 
telerehabilitation on cognitive abilities in individuals with MCI 
and in patients with neurodegenerative diseases associated with 
cognitive impairment (Cotelli et al., 2019). MCI is a condition 
associated with risk of progression to dementia, and represents 
a well-suited target for prevention studies (Petersen et al., 1999, 
2014; Petersen, 2004; Livingston et al., 2017). However, these 
treatments are delivered in several ways and there is not a clinical 
consensus about content-design of telerehabilitation. A ﬁxed 
schedule approach has proved to be eﬀective in the treatment of 
elderly people with high risk of conversion in dementia resulting 
in a signiﬁcant improvement in global cognitive functioning, 
memory and processing speed (Lampit et al., 2014). In other 
studies, participants were given the opportunity to choose free 
among the activities available in each session of training (Medalia 
and Freilich, 2008; Gooding et al., 2016). A third alternative 
consisted in the user-centered approach, which customized 
the choice of rehabilitative contents based on the performance 
obtained by the individual to the set up tests implemented in 
the software at the beginning of the rehabilitation path (Solana 
et al., 2015; Vance et al., 2018). So far, the majority of studies 
are feasibility or pilot studies with small-medium sample size 
and are very heterogeneous in terms of intensity and duration 
of treatment (Burdea et al., 2015; Espay et al., 2016; Dodakian 
et al., 2017). For this reason, in the light of this ongoing deep 
transformation of health care, it is of great relevance the eﬀort 
to harmonize intervention protocols and randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) are strongly needed to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness 
of these home-based technology-enhanced treatment protocols 
with respect to the gold-standard, named the usual face-to-face 
care (Linden et al., 2016; Fetta et al., 2017; Topol, 2019). 
The main aim of the current study was to evaluate the eﬃcacy 
of the cognitive face-to-face virtual reality rehabilitation system 
(VRRS) and to compare it to that of face-to-face cognitive 
treatment as usual for subjects with MCI. We hypothesized 
that the face-to-face VRRS system would ameliorate memory 
and attentional abilities more than treatment as usual 
in 
subjects with MCI. 
Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that the implementation 
of home-based treatment through the cognitive VRRS system 
could induce long-term beneﬁts, prolonging the beneﬁcial eﬀects 
of face-to-face. 










Recruitment and treatment were conducted at the IRCCS Istituto 
Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli of Brescia, the 
IRCCS Centro Neurolesi Bonino-Pulejo, Messina, and the IRCCS 
Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi Onlus of Milan, from April 2018 
to February 2020 (see Figure 1). 
Study Design 
This was a multicenter rater-blinded, active-controlled and 
randomized study. The investigators and outcome assessors were 


blinded to the type of treatment. Participants were randomized 
into three groups: (a) those who received face-to-face cognitive 
VRRS treatment 
telerehabilitation 
(clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS), where subjects received face- 
followed 
to-face cognitive VRRS treatment 
by 
(b) 
treatment 
those who received face-to-face cognitive VRRS treatment 
stimulation 
followed by 
at-home unstructured cognitive 
(clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS), where 
received 
followed by at-home unstructured 
clinic-VRRS treatment 
those who 
cognitive stimulation (Tele@H-UCS); and (c) 














(clinic- 
received face-to-face cognitive treatment as usual 
TAU), where participants received only face-to-face cognitive 
conventional rehabilitation. 
The treatment group assigned to each patient was obtained 
by stratiﬁed randomization according to age and his/her 
performance in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 
(Folstein et al., 1975). Stratiﬁed randomization is achieved by 
generating a separate block for each combination of covariates, 
and participants are assigned to the appropriate block of 
covariates by a researcher blinded to the study aims. Details of 
the allocated group were given on cards contained in sequentially 
numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes. 


This study was approved by the local ethics committees 
and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration 
of Helsinki 
to CONSORT 
(Boutron et al., 2008; Boutron et al., 2017). 
guidelines 
(NCT 
trial was 
The 
number: NCT03486704). 






All participants were made fully aware of the aims of the 
research, and written informed consent was obtained from all 
subjects from the local center. 
Participants 
Forty-nine older adults fulﬁlling the Petersen criteria for MCI 
(Petersen, 2011) were recruited. All participants were living 
independently in the community at the time of their baseline 
evaluation and were followed up annually during at least 2 years 
before recruitment in the present study. 

studies have investigated cognitive 
VRRS treatment eﬀects on memory outcome, the sample size 
calculation was based on a prior study on patients with AD (Jelcic 
et al., 2014), with an eﬀect size of 0.85 (Cohen’s d) for the MMSE 
score (Folstein et al., 1975) improvement after telerehabilitation 
treatment, a signiﬁcance level (α) of 0.05 and a power (1-β) = 80 
[two-tailed independent t-test)]. The estimated sample size was 
twelve participants for each group. 
All the participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision 
and were characterized by the following: (a) memory complaints; 
(b) preservation of general cognitive functioning documented by 
MMSE scores from 24 to 30 (Folstein et al., 1975); (c) age over 
65 years; (d) global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 
0.5 (Morris, 1997); (e) preservation of functional activities; (f) 
absence of criteria for a diagnosis of dementia according to DSM- 
V (American Psychiatric Association, 2014); and (g) absence of 
mood and anxiety disorders. Moreover, before inclusion in the 
cognitive training protocol, the availability and motivation of 
subjects to participate consecutively in the protocol for its entire 
duration and the presence of a caregiver for the completion of 
questionnaires at all time assessments were veriﬁed. 
The following stringent exclusion criteria were applied: 
(a) other prior or current neurological or major psychiatric 
disorders; (b) visual perception disorder and/or hearing loss; 
(c) history of traumatic brain injury, brain tumor or stroke; 
and (d) history of alcohol abuse. None of the participants had 
participated in cognitive training protocols within the year before 
enrollment or during the entire duration of the present study 
(from baseline to the last follow-up assessment). 
Assessment Procedures 
Evaluation Timeline 
The evaluations were carried out for all groups at baseline 
(T0), at the end of face-to-face treatment (T1, 1 month from 
baseline), and after 4 months (T2) and 7 months (T3) from 
baseline. The T2 follow-up visit corresponded to the end of 
the at-home treatment for the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS 
and clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS groups. All the assessments 
were carried out by expert neuropsychologists blinded to the 
treatment allocation of the participants. Since the participants 
were aware of the type of intervention received, they were advised 
not to declare the type of treatment carried out during the 
post-treatment and follow-up evaluations, making the treatment 
conditions unknown to the clinical psychologist who conducted 
the evaluations. 
A comprehensive clinical, functional and neuropsychological 
evaluation was performed at all visits (T0, T1, T2, and 
T3). During baseline assessment, family history of dementia, 
record of medical events, current medication and complete 
neurologic examination results were recorded and the CDR scale 
(Morris, 1997) and the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire 
(CRIq) (Nucci et al., 2012) were completed. In addition, the 
participants in the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS and clinic- 
VRRS + Tele@H-UCS groups underwent a computerized 
cognitive assessment and an assessment of system usability. 
Clinical and Functional Assessment 
The evaluation of subjective memory complaints was conducted 
using the 20-item version (range: 20–180) of the Everyday 
Memory Questionnaire (Sunderland et al., 1986; Calabria et al., 
2011). Functional abilities were evaluated using basic (BADL) and 
instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) scales (Katz, 1983; 
Lawton and Brody, 1988). Depression was assessed with the 30- 
item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (Yesavage 
et al., 1982), whereas neuropsychiatric symptoms were recorded 
using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (Cummings et al., 
1994; Binetti et al., 1998). Finally, quality of life was recorded 
using the Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QOL-AD) scale 
(Bianchetti et al., 2017). 
Neuropsychological Assessment 
In addition to clinical and functional assessments, all participants 
were tested at each visit with a standardized neuropsychological 
battery. Cognitive tests were applied to assess a broad range 
of cognitive abilities commonly aﬀected by MCI. The battery 
took approximately 90 min and included the MMSE (Folstein 
et al., 1975) for the assessment of global cognition; Raven’s 
Colored Progressive Matrices for non-verbal reasoning (Basso 
et al., 1987); verbal ﬂuency (phonemic, FPL; and semantic, 
FPC) (Novelli et al., 1986) and action and object naming 
the assessment of aphasic 
subtests 
disorders (BADA, Miceli et al., 1994) for language production; 
the Rey–Osterrieth complex ﬁgure test-copy (Caﬀarra et al., 
2002) and the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) (Shulman et al., 











the Trail Making 
1993) 
Test (TMT) part A and part B (Giovagnoli et al., 1996; 
Siciliano et al., 2019) for attention functions; and the Rey 
Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), immediate and delayed 
recall (Carlesimo et al., 1996), the Free and Cued Selective 
Reminding Test (FCSRT) (Frasson et al., 2011) and the Rey– 
Osterrieth complex ﬁgure test-recall (Caﬀarra et al., 2002) for 
episodic memory. All the tests were administered and scored 
according to standard procedures (Lezak et al., 2012) (see 
Tables 3, 4 for details). 
Computerized Cognitive Tasks 
In the case of 
the participants who received face-to-face 
VRRS treatment (the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS and clinic- 
VRRS + Tele@H-UCS groups), 
the performances achieved 
during VRRS treatment were further analyzed to assess memory, 
visuospatial abilities, attention and executive functions. 
In 
particular, we recorded the performance of each patient in 
the ﬁrst clinic-VRRS session (as the baseline score, T0), and 
then we registered the participants’ performances obtained 
during the last clinic-VRRS session as the post-treatment rating 
(T1). Moreover, participants underwent computerized cognitive 
assessment during follow-up assessments (T2, T3) to analyze 
long-term eﬀects. 
Assessment of System Usability 
To record subjective assessments of 
the clinic-VRRS, we 
administered the System Usability Scale (SUS) (Brooke, 1996; 
Bangor et al., 2008, 2009; Peres et al., 2013) to all 
the 
subjects who received clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS and 
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS at T1. Moreover, we recorded 
the SUS scores at T2 in the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS 
group to assess cognitive telerehabilitation usability (Tele@H- 
VRRS usability). The SUS is a 10-item, ﬁve-point Likert scale 
(1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). The scoring 
instructions described by Brooke (35) were considered. The ﬁnal 
score ranges from 10 to 100. 
Cognitive Rehabilitation Procedures 
The cognitive rehabilitation protocol was delivered to all 
participants according to the corresponding experimental group. 
Face-to-Face Cognitive VRRS Treatment 
(Clinic-VRRS) 
Participants assigned to the clinic-VRRS group received twelve 
60-min sessions of individualized cognitive rehabilitation using 
VRRS1 
in the clinic with a user-centered approach over

4 weeks. Subjects were seated in front of a computer screen 
in a quiet room. 

included twelve 
exercises designed to enhance memory, visuospatial abilities, 
attention and executive functions (listed in Table 1). In each 
treatment session, the participant worked with six exercises, 
10 min each, so that each exercise was completed six times 
over the twelve clinic-VRRS sessions. The subject was asked to 
continue to perform each task until the end of the set time. The 
therapist suggested to the participant some strategies aiming to 
improve performance in all the treatment sessions except for 
the ﬁrst and last sessions. At the end of each training session, 
subjects received feedback on their performances, and a detailed 
report of the results was made available to the therapist, allowing 
the monitoring of progress over time. Clinical VRRS treatment 
was tailored to the patient’s baseline characteristics through 
a pre-training session. The starting level and the number of 
trials were adjusted according to the subject’s performance level 
using an adaptive staircase procedure. Progress was continuously 
monitored, and the exercises adaptively progressed in diﬃculty. 
Face-to-Face Cognitive Treatment as Usual 
(Clinic-TAU) 
Participants assigned to the clinic-TAU group received twelve 
60-min sessions of group cognitive stimulation in the clinic. 
During these group sessions, which were led by mental health 
professionals, reality orientation therapy, reminiscence therapy, 
paper and pencil exercises and metacognitive training aiming to 
learn cognitive strategies and to use external aids were proposed. 
At the end of this face-to-face treatment, participants were 
the 

requested not 
conclusion of the entire protocol. 
Home-Based Cognitive VRRS Treatment 
(Tele@H-VRRS) 
The participants assigned to the Tele@H-VRRS group received, 
after the end of face-to-face treatment, thirty-six 60-min sessions 
of home-based cognitive VRRS treatment (see “text footnote 
1”), three sessions for week over 3 months. Twelve exercises 
designed to enhance memory, visuospatial abilities, attention 
and executive functions, diﬀerent from those used in face-to- 
face VRRS training, were selected (listed in Table 2). In each 
treatment session, a participant worked with six exercises, 10 min 
each, task diﬃculty adaptively progressed, and the performances 
were continuously monitored by the therapist. The subject 
was asked to continue to perform each task until the end 
of the set time. 

telerehabilitation functionalities, 
the same functionalities applied in 
allowing the use of 
the face-to-face treatment. For the at-home treatment, each 
participant received a home-based kit including a tablet that 
allowed access to a daily individualized training program, 









a detailed VRRS tablet manual, an exercise instructions 
booklet and a participant diary. Before beginning the home- 
based treatment, 
the therapist downloaded all 36 sessions 
of the appropriate individualized cognitive training exercise 
on the patient’s 
tablet and assisted the participants and 
to familiarize them with 
their caregivers at ﬁrst access 
the technological device. During home-based treatment, the 
therapist provided continuous assistance for technical diﬃculties 
and individualized cognitive training exercises were adjusted by 
the therapist once a week. 
Home-Based Unstructured Cognitive Stimulation 
(Tele@H-UCS) 
Subjects assigned to the Tele@H-UCS group were requested 
to work on detailed activities 60 min a day, 
three times 
a week (36 sessions in total) over 12 weeks after the end 
of face-to-face treatment. They received, from the therapist, 
an instructions booklet and a participant diary. Conventional 
instruments, such as paper and pencil exercises, creative 
manual activities, reading newspapers and magazines, watching 
documentaries, crosswords and sudoku, were suggested. Each 
participant was requested to compile a detailed diary reporting 
the performed activities. 
Outcomes 
Primary outcome measures were the changes in two tasks of 
verbal episodic memory: (a) the RAVLT, immediate and delayed 
recall; and (b) the FCSRT. 
The secondary outcomes included quality of life measures, 
subjective memory complaints and neuropsychological measures 
evaluating memory, language, attention and visuo-constructional 
functions. The choice of outcomes was based on previous 
literature ﬁndings and on predeﬁned hypotheses of investigation. 
Inference on them was performed considering each outcome 
singularly (i.e., not simultaneous inference was done on all 
outcome, thus no multiple comparison was needed to compare 
outcomes results each other (see e.g., Proschan and Follmann, 
1995; Bender and Lange, 2001). 
Statistical Analysis 
Summary statistics are expressed as means and standard 
deviations. Comparisons of socio-demographic features between 
groups were evaluated by parametric (t-tests) or corresponding 
non-parametric (Mann–Whitney) tests. Variable distribution was 
inspected through histograms and the use of the Kolmogorov– 
Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk tests. Consistent with the type of 
variable distribution (Gaussian, Poisson or Gamma), generalized 
linear mixed models (GLMMs) were performed to evaluate 
score diﬀerences across time points and between groups. In 
detail, the ﬁrst series of GLMMs was applied to compare 
two groups (clinic-TAU vs. clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS 
together with clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS) across two time 
points (baseline and post-treatment). Subsequently, GLMMs 
were performed to compare the three subject groups across 
four time points (baseline, post-treatment, 4-month follow- 
up, and 7-month follow-up). Diﬀerent test scores were used 
as dependent variables (one for each model), and the eﬀects 
(time, group and time × group) were considered independent 
variables. Sequential Sidak correction was used for the evaluation 
of post hoc. 
Statistical signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.05. Statistical analyses 
were carried out by using SPSS 25.0. Graphs were generated using

three 
experimental groups: 18 participants were allocated to the 
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS group, 14 subjects 
to the 
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS group and 17 participants to the 
clinic-TAU group. All the participants completed the baseline

(see Figure 1-Flowchart). 

indexed by the number 
of sessions completed for each participant. Concerning the 
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS group, all 18 participants 
completed the 12 sessions of face-to-face VRRS treatment, 6 
participants completed all 36 sessions of at-home VRRS training, 
whereas all other subjects completed more than 70% of the 
telerehabilitation sessions. Moreover, all 14 participants in the 
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS group completed the 12 sessions 
of face-to-face VRRS treatment, 7 subjects completed the 36 
sessions of at-home unstructured cognitive stimulation, and 
the other subjects completed more than 70% of the at-home 
unstructured cognitive stimulation sessions. Finally, 8 subjects 
in the clinic-TAU group completed the 12 sessions, whereas 
all the other subjects completed more than 70% of the usual 
treatment sessions. 
Participants 
We enrolled 49 patients with MCI, 42 (86%) amnestic MCI 
and 7 (14%) non-amnestic MCI participants. In particular, the 
current sample included: (i) 20 amnestic single domain MCI 
(aMCI-s); (ii) 22 amnestic multiple domain MCI (aMCI-m); 10 
of them showed an additional deﬁcit in visuo-constructional 
functions, 2 in attention, 3 in language, 4 in attention and visuo- 
constructional functions and 1 in attention and language; (iii) 
6 non-amnestic single domain MCI (naMCI-s), presence of a 
disability in another cognitive area (1 of them showed deﬁcit in 
language, 3 in visuo-constructional functions and 2 in attention 
abilities), with normal memory; and (iv) 1 non-amnestic multiple 
domain MCI (naMCI-m), with disabilities in attention and visuo- 
constructional functions, with normal memory. 
The mean age of the participants was 76.5 years (SD = 4.2), the 
mean number of years of education was 10.7 years (SD = 4.4), and 
24 participants (49.0%) were male. The clinic-VRRS + Tele@H- 
VRRS group included 13 male and 5 female participants (age: 
mean, 75.3 years, SD: 3.3; education: 11.8 years, SD 4.8); the 
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS group included 4 male and 10 









female participants (age: mean, 76.3 years, SD: 4.9; education: 
10.5 years, SD 4.8); and the clinic-TAU group included 7 male and 
10 female participants (age: mean, 78.1 years, SD: 4.1; education: 
9.8 years, SD 3.7). 
The three groups did not diﬀer regarding age (p = 0.142) or 
education (p = 0.405), but there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in sex 
(p = 0.036). Descriptive statistics of all clinical features of the three 
groups of patients, measured at the four time points, are reported 
in Table 3. 
Face-to-Face Cognitive Virtual Reality 
Rehabilitation System vs. Face-to-Face 
Cognitive Treatment as Usual 
Our ﬁrst aim was to evaluate the eﬃcacy of the face-to-face 
VRRS (clinic-VRRS) and to compare it to that of cognitive 
treatment as usual (clinic-TAU). For this purpose, we considered 
two groups of subjects: those who received VRRS (i.e., the 
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS and clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS 
groups) and those who received treatment as usual (i.e., the clinic- 
TAU group), and we compared their scores at the ﬁrst two time 
points (baseline, T0; and after face-to-face treatment, T1). 
We performed diﬀerent GLMMs, one for each outcome, 
with time (two time points), group (two treatments) and their 
interaction as independent variables, to verify whether the two 
treatments had diﬀerent eﬀects on the outcomes. The results are 
shown in Table 4 (ﬁrst columns). 
The performances of the two groups at the two time points 
were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for the FCSRT IFR, FPC and CDT 
(p-value of the interaction term equal to 0.010, 0.024, and 0.010, 
respectively). Moreover, for the TMT A, there was a trend toward 
signiﬁcance (p = 0.058). 

the resulting signiﬁcant outcomes are presented in 
Figure 2. In particular, the FCSRT IFR, CDT and TMT A 
scores improved only after clinic-VRRS (FCSRT IFR: p < 0.001; 
CDT: p < 0.001; TMT A: p = 0.002). Although in TMT A 
and CDT scores a signiﬁcant diﬀerence was observed between 
the two groups at baseline assessment, an improvement in 
these tests could be recorded exclusively in clinic-VRRS group. 
Regarding the FPC, the clinic-VRRS group showed an increase 
from T0 to T1, whereas the clinic-TAU group showed worse FPC 
performance, inducing a signiﬁcant time × group interaction 
(although the changes within groups did not reach signiﬁcance). 
Thus, by combining the information provided by the models and 
ﬁgures, we showed that the clinic-VRRS was more eﬃcient than 
clinic-TAU, improving memory (FCSRT IFR), language (FPC), 
attention (TMT A) and visuo-constructional abilities (CDT). 
Home-Based VRRS Rehabilitation 
(Tele@H-VRRS) vs. Home-Based 
Unstructured Cognitive Stimulation 
(Tele@H-UCS) vs. No Additional 
Treatment 
After the ﬁrst month, the participants who received clinic- 
VRRS were divided into two subgroups in which cognitive 
telerehabilitation and unstructured cognitive stimulation were 
provided, while those who received usual care did not 
receive any additional treatment during the following months. 
Our second aim was to assess whether the telerehabilitation 
VRRS system could extend the beneﬁcial eﬀects of face-to- 
face VRRS treatment. 
this 
verify 
diﬀerent GLMMs were 


performed (one for each outcome) using time (four time 
points), group (three groups) 
interaction as 
independent variables. The results of the models are shown 
in Table 4 (last columns). 

Regarding the neuropsychological assessment, the outcome 
that behaved in a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent way in the three 
groups over time was the FCSRT IFR. As reported earlier, 
from T0 to T1 
the FCSRT IFR showed an improvement 
in the clinic-VRRS group. By splitting the clinic-VRRS 
group into two subgroups, 
this improvement signiﬁcantly 
decreased after the end of face-to-face treatment in the clinic- 
VRRS + Tele@H-UCS group (T1 vs. T2 p = 0.025; T1 
vs. T3 p = 0.003), whereas no strong evidence of changes 
in the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS group was recorded 
(T1 vs. T2 p = 0.055; T1 vs. T3 p = 0.084). Although 
the mean changes from T1 to T2 were similar in clinic- 
VRRS + Tele@H-UCS and in clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS 
groups, diﬀerent statistical signiﬁcance were mainly driven by 
diﬀerence in variability (standard deviations) recorded in the 
two experimental groups. As stated above, the clinic-TAU group 
did not show any signiﬁcant modiﬁcation across all time points 
(see Table 4). 
Computerized Cognitive Tasks 
Diﬀerent GLMMs were performed (Table 5), and it followed 
that the two groups were diﬀerent, across time, in the two 
tasks “Complete the logic relationship” and “Safe opening- 
forward” (interaction term p-values equal to 0.007 and 0.016, 
respectively). For the ﬁrst task, the performance of subjects 
was diﬀerent at all time points in the two groups (Figure 3). 
Post hoc analysis showed that there was a diﬀerent trend in the 
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS and clinic-VRRS + Tele@H- 
UCS groups, with very similar scores at T1 (p = 0.825) 
in the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS 
and higher 
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-UCS group 
group than in the 
at both follow-up visits (T2: p = 0.033; T3: p = 0.042). 
For 
score diﬀered 
signiﬁcantly over time between the two groups: only the 
clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS group showed an improvement 
from T0 and T1 (p = 0.017) and worsening from T1 and T2 
(p = 0.044). 




System Usability Scale 
Interestingly, the SUS, administered at T1 to the two groups who 
received clinic-VRRS, showed good usability performance of the 
clinic-VRRS system (67.8, SD 11.6), and the SUS scores obtained 
at T2 in the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS group, which received 
home-based telerehabilitation from T1 and T2, highlighted good 
usability performance from the VRRS telerehabilitation system 
(69.6, SD 8.8) (Bangor et al., 2008).

In recent years, the potential usefulness of cognitive training in 
normal aging and MCI has received increased attention (Brown, 
2015; Vannini et al., 2017). Recent meta-analyses and reviews 
have reported that non-pharmacological cognitive interventions 
are eﬀective in maintaining cognitive function in high-risk older 
adults (Kidd, 2008; Li et al., 2011, 2014, 2017; Hong et al., 2015; 
Janoutova et al., 2015; Sherman et al., 2017; Yao et al., 2020).

The main purpose of this study was to investigate the eﬃcacy

FIGURE 3 | Effects of home-based cognitive telerehabilitation (Tele@H-VRRS) vs. home-based unstructured cognitive stimulation (Tele@H-UCS) vs. no treatment on 
computerized cognitive tasks. Asterisks indicate statistical signiﬁcance. 
Speciﬁcally, we hypothesized that face-to-face cognitive VRRS 
treatment may lead to an improvement in cognitive functions, 
that is, memory and attentional abilities, compared with face-to- 
face cognitive treatment as usual. 
Moreover, we assessed whether an innovative cognitive 
long-term 



telerehabilitation 
cognitive beneﬁts. 
To address these questions, we compared the eﬀects of face- 
to-face cognitive VRRS followed by cognitive telerehabilitation 
(clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS), face-to-face cognitive VRRS 
followed by at-home unstructured cognitive stimulation (clinic- 
VRRS + Tele@H-UCS), and face-to-face cognitive rehabilitation 
program as usual (clinic-TAU) on cognition in patients with MCI. 
Overall, high rates of participant agreement, recruitment and 
treatment adherence supported the feasibility of both face-to- 
face and telerehabilitation interventions. Moreover, the analyses 
on system usability evidenced good usability of clinic-VRRS 
and Tele@H-VRRS. 
The current ﬁndings show a signiﬁcant improvement in 
memory, language and visuo-constructional abilities after the 
end of face-to-face cognitive VRRS treatment compared to face- 
to-face cognitive treatment as usual. Our ﬁndings are in line 
with previous studies that described the usefulness of face-to- 
face virtual reality rehabilitation protocols aimed at improving 
memory and executive functioning in older participants with 
mild cognitive diﬃculties (Liao et al., 2019; Moreno et al., 
2019; Tuena et al., 2020) as well as previous studies of eﬀective 
cognitive treatments to prevent and slow the progression of MCI 
(Belleville, 2008). 
Regarding at-home treatment, we found that cognitive 
VRRS telerehabilitation has comparable eﬀects to conventional 
rehabilitation in improving cognitive abilities in patients with 
neurodegenerative diseases. We evidenced positive eﬀects of 
VRRS telerehabilitation interventions, generally comparable 
with those cognitive unstructured home-based intervention. 
This comparable eﬀect may be related to the modalities in 
which the VRRS intervention was delivered: a computerized 
cognitive training modality without a real 
interaction and 
feedback between patient and therapist. The synchronous (in 
which patient and therapist perform exercises in real time) or 
asynchronous (in which patient and therapist do not interact 
in real time) interactions, and the type of monitoring feedback, 
i.e., on line (during the intervention) or oﬀ line (delayed), 
are key components that may inﬂuence the eﬃcacy of the 
telerehabilitation and have thus been considered (Di Tella et al., 
2019) in future studies. Importantly, clinic-VRRS + Tele@H- 
VRRS group showed greater maintenance of treatment gains 
in episodic memory (i.e., FCSRT). Moreover, participants in 
the clinic-VRRS + Tele@H-VRRS group exhibited signiﬁcant 
intervention-related improvements in executive functions as 
assessed by computerized cognitive tasks, with maintenance of 
gains at the 7-month follow-up. Our results might be related 
to patient’s engagement and adherence in a telerehabilitation 
design involving asynchronous therapist-patient 
interactions 
(Matamala-Gomez et al., 2020). 
The available evidence is insuﬃcient to draw ﬁrm conclusions 
on the eﬀects of diﬀerent interventions on functional activities 
or quality of life. Further, well-designed studies investigating the 
eﬃcacy of cognitive telerehabilitation are necessary. 
We acknowledge that our study has some limitations. First, 
given our relatively small sample size, the recorded ﬁndings 
should be conﬁrmed in larger samples to reach a ﬁrm conclusion. 
A larger sample size would make it possible to take into 
account in the analyses individual variables such as age, sex and 
gender. Furthermore, the adoption of longer follow-up visits in 
future studies would better highlight the duration of the long- 
term eﬀects induced by the applied treatments. Finally, in the 
present study some intergroup variabilities in cognitive scores 
are recorded and the use of a crossover design could be used in 
future studies in order to avoid problems of comparability of the 
experimental groups with regard to confounding characteristics. 
study provides preliminary 
evidence in support of individualized VRRS treatment, and 
telerehabilitation delivery for cognitive rehabilitation is quite 
encouraging and should pave the way for future studies aiming 
at identifying optimal treatment protocols in subjects with MCI. 
This research supports the feasibility and beneﬁts of cognitive 
rehabilitation provided by telerehabilitation systems. This may 
be particularly important for subjects with limited access to 
transport diﬃculties 
therapy due to geographical distance, 










or a lack of local services. The recent COVID-19 emergency 
has clearly indicated the importance of 
remote delivery 
of cognitive rehabilitation to support ongoing rehabilitation 
services and guarantee continuity of care to subjects with 
cognitive impairment.
