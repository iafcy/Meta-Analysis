Background: Spaced retrieval training (SRT) is a nonpharmacological intervention for mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and dementia that trains the learning and retention of target information by recalling it over increasingly 
long intervals. We recently developed the Ubiquitous Spaced Retrieval-based Memory Advancement and 
Rehabilitation Training (USMART) program as a convenient, self-administered tablet-based SRT program. We also 
demonstrated the utility of USMART for improving memory in individuals with MCI through an open-label 
uncontrolled trial. 
Methods: This study had an open-label, single-blind, randomized, controlled, two-period crossover design. Fifty 
patients with MCI were randomized into USMART–usual care and usual care–USMART treatment sequences. 
USMART was completed or usual care was provided biweekly over a 4-week treatment period with a 2-week 
washout period between treatment periods. Primary outcome measures included the Word List Memory Test, Word 
List Recall Test (WLRT), and Word List Recognition Test. Outcomes were measured at baseline, week 5, and week 11 
by raters who were blinded to intervention type. An intention-to-treat analysis and linear mixed modeling were 
used. 
Results: Of 50 randomized participants, 41 completed the study (18% dropout rate). The USMART group had larger 
improvements in WLRT score (effect size = 0.49, p = 0.031) than the usual care group. There were no significant 
differences in other primary or secondary measures between the USMART and usual care groups. Moreover, no 
USMART-related adverse events were reported. 
Conclusions: The 4-week USMART modestly improved information retrieval in older people with MCI, and was well 
accepted with minimal technical support.

Background 
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents an at-risk 
stage of cognitive decline between normal aging and de- 
mentia [1]. Given the absence of an approved pharmaco- 
[2], clinical research has 
logical 
advocated the use of several nonpharmacological inter- 
ventions designed to optimize patient cognition, affect, 
and global functioning [3–6]. Spaced retrieval training 
(SRT) is one such intervention that trains the learning 
and retention of target information by recalling it over 
increasingly long intervals [7]. In previous research, SRT 
was found to improve prospective memory [8] and the 
capacity to learn face–name associations [9] in patients 
with MCI. SRT also improves semantic memory and be- 
havioral strategies in patients with dementia [10, 11]. 
Studies have speculated that SRT improves learning 
through a combination of ecologically valid priming, spa- 
cing effect, conditioning, and errorless learning [11, 12]. 
In previous work by our group, we developed the 24- 
session Spaced Retrieval-based Memory Advancement 
and Rehabilitation Training (SMART) program and dem- 
onstrated its ability to improve memory retention spans in 
patients with very mild-to-mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
through an open-label uncontrolled trial [13]. Expanded 
retention spans induced by the SMART program were 
maintained for different sets of target information, in- 
dicating that the effects of SMART on memory may 
be generalized [13, 14]. 


Information technologies are increasingly incorporated 
into therapeutic strategies to improve the accessibility and 
effectiveness 
interventions. 
Computer-based interventions enable the standardization 
and individualization of 
interventions, the unobtrusive 
real-time monitoring of cognitive performance, adjust- 
intervention, and reductions in 
ment of the level of 
personnel and implementation costs [15]. Computer- 
based cognitive training has been successfully delivered to 
old adults with normal cognition, MCI, and AD [15], and 
was effective in improving global cognition, selective cog- 
nitive domains, and psychosocial functioning of patients 
with MCI [16]. 
SRT was also delivered successfully to patients with de- 
mentia as a program on computers and tablets [17, 18]. A 
study of computer-assisted SRT for face–name associa- 
tions in participants with mild to moderate dementia re- 
ported that 20 of 23 patients succeeded in learning novel 
information over 
and familiar names and biographical 
32 minutes. Among these 20 participants, 17 patients 
showed transfer of familiar names from the training ses- 
sions to real-life interactions, and 19 patients retained the 
learned names until 6 weeks after the SRT [17]. In our 
previous work, we transformed the SMART program into 
a tablet-based application called the ubiquitous SMART 
(USMART) program. This program was self-administered 
by the patients with MCI or early dementia without the 
support of a trained therapist, and was effective in improv- 
ing memory in patients with MCI in an open-label uncon- 
trolled trial [14]. 
In the present study, we aimed to validate the efficacy 
of USMART on memory function in patients with MCI 
in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). 
Methods 
Subjects 
We enrolled a total of 50 patients with MCI (10 amnes- 
tic single domain type, 25 amnestic multiple domains 
type, 12 nonamnestic single domain type, and 3 nonam- 
nestic multiple domains type). Patients were recruited 
from the dementia clinic of Seoul National University 
Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) (n = 28) and the Korean 
Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Aging and Dementia 
(KLOSCAD) [19] (n = 22) between August 2014 and 
October 2014. The KLOSCAD is a population-based 
prospective older people cohort study on cognitive aging 
and dementia that was launched in 2009. 
Research geropsychiatrists with expertise in dementia 
research evaluated each patient using the Korean version 
of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s 
Disease (CERAD-K) [20]. Research neuropsychologists 
administered the Korean version of the CERAD Neuro- 
psychological Assessment Battery (CERAD-K-N) [20], 
the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) [21] and the Digit 
Span Test (DST) [22]. The CERAD-K-N [23] consists of 
nine neuropsychological tests, including the Categorical 
Fluency Test (CFT), the Modified Boston Naming Test 
(mBNT), the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), 
the Word List Memory Test (WLMT), the Construc- 
tional Praxis Test (CPT), the Word List Recall Test 
(WLRT), the Word List Recognition Test (WLRcT), the 
Constructional Recall Test (CRT), and the Trail Making 
Test A (TMT-A). 
MCI was diagnosed according to the revised diagnostic 
criteria for MCI proposed by the International Working 
Group on MCI [24]. Cognitive concerns were confirmed 


by the clinicians, who referred to self-and/or informant- 
reported cognitive decline. We ascertained the presence 
of objective cognitive impairment if a participant had a 
score less than −1.0 standard deviation (SD) of the age-, 
gender-, and education-adjusted norm for elderly Ko- 
reans on any of the 11 neuropsychological tests (FAB, 
DST forward, DST backward, CFT, mBNT, WLMT, 
CPT, WLRT, WLRcT, CRT, and TMT-A). Amnestic-type 
MCI was defined by impairment in any of the four 
memory tests (WLMT, WLRT, WLRcT, and CRT). We 
required that basic activities of daily living were pre- 
served, and that impairment in complex instrumental 
functions were insufficient for a diagnosis of dementia. 
This level of functional impairment was determined by 
the clinical judgment of research geropsychiatrists and 
confirmed in case conferences by research geropsychia- 
trists. Patients with dementia were diagnosed according 
to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis- 
orders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria [25] and ex- 
cluded from the study. We also excluded patients with 
major psychiatric disorders listed in Axis I of the DSM- 
IV [25], any neurological disorders that could affect cog- 
nitive function, any physical condition that could pre- 
clude regular attendance and full intervention-program 
participation, and illiteracy. We did not exclude patients 
who were regularly taking stable doses of cognitive en- 
hancers, 
least 
for at 
3 months before 
these patients were 
instructed to maintain their medication regimens for the 
duration of the trial.

Study design 
This study was an open-label, single-blind, randomized, 
controlled, two-period crossover trial (clinicaltrials.gov 
NCT01688128) investigating the efficacy of USMART in 
patients with MCI. Randomization was performed by 
the Medical Research Collaborating Center at SNUBH, 
who had no contact with patients or caregivers. A ran- 
dom code table and permuted-block randomization with 
varying block sizes [26] were used in SAS software, ver- 
sion 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The alloca- 
tion 
and 
produced 
concealed until patients had entered the trial. The trial 
consisted of two 4-week periods that were crossed over. 
During the first period, patients were randomized to re- 
ceive either USMART (n = 25) or usual care (n = 25). 
After a 2-week washout period, the groups were crossed 
over to receive the alternative treatment for 4 weeks. 
Clinical and neuropsychological characteristics were 
assessed at the beginning (week 0), the end of the first 
treatment period (week 5), and the end of the second 


treatment period (week 11) by raters who were blinded 
to intervention type (Fig. 1). This study protocol was ap- 
proved by the Institutional Review Board of SNUBH 
(no. E-1207/162-001). 
Interventions 
The USMART program was developed by transforming 
SMART, an offline face-to-face spaced retrieval-based 
into a self-administered 
memory training program, 
application on an iPad tablet 
[14]. Participants self- 
administered the USMART program for 30 min per ses- 
twice per week, over the 4-week intervention 
sion, 
period. In each session, the retrieval interval was sequen- 
tially doubled from 0.75 to 12 min (i.e., 0.75, 1.5, 3, 6, 
and 12 min). If the participant succeeded in recalling a 
given set of words within 12 min in two consecutive ses- 
sions, the number of words to be memorized within a 
session was automatically sequentially increased in the 
following session from one to five words. All procedures 
during USMART were guided by automatic verbal mes- 
sages from the application [14]. In order to adhere to 
the study protocol, an occupational 
therapist was 
assigned to each participant, visited the participant at 
every training session with a tablet that had USMART 
installed, and took the tablet back after each training 
session. In each session, the assigned occupational ther- 
apist encouraged the participant to practice USMART, 
but did not provide any assistance for using the 
USMART application. We gathered the training records 
of the participants automatically via a web portal service. 
Outcome measures 
The primary outcome measures were WLMT, WLRT, 
and WLRcT scores [20]. Secondary outcome measures 
included the Subjective Memory Complaint Question- 
naire (SMCQ) which measures 
subjective memory 
complaints [27], the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) 
which measures the severity of depressive mood [28], 
and the MMSE which measures the level of global 
cognition [29]. All outcome measures were evaluated 
at weeks 0, 5, and 11 by trained research psycholo- 
gists who were blinded to allocation information 
(Fig. 1). 
Sample size and statistical analyses 
Assuming an attrition rate of 20%, a sample size of 50 
patients (25 per treatment arm) would provide more 
than 80% power to detect a 2.5-point mean difference in 
WLRT with a SD of 2.53 (as in the Korean validation 
study [20]) at a two-sided type-I error of 0.05. 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as 
all randomized patients who provided at 
least one 
baseline efficacy assessment and attended at least one 
treatment session; this population was used for our 



primary efficacy evaluation. Five-week and 11-week 
last-observation-carried-forward analyses were per- 
formed for missing values. Baseline characteristics 
were summarized according to treatment sequence 
and compared using unpaired t tests for continuous 
variables and chi-squared tests for categorical vari- 
ables. The effects of USMART on memory function, 
global cognition, and depressive mood were assessed 
using a linear mixed model for a repeated-measures 
covariance pattern model with compound symmetry 
within subjects. Period and treatment were included 
in the model as fixed effects, and patients were in- 
cluded in the model as a random effect. The models 
were adjusted for age, gender, education, and current 
cognitive-enhancer use. Effect sizes were calculated as 
described by Cohen [30]. For all analyses, two-sided 
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All 
statistical analyses were performed using Predictive 
Analytics Software Statistics version 18.0.0 software 
(2009; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 
Results 
Participants 
Of 50 randomized participants, 43 completed the first 
intervention period (Fig. 1). Two patients from the 
USMART–usual care sequence and five patients from 
the usual care–USMART sequence did not enter the first 
intervention period because they were no longer willing 
to participate (n = 2), had an acute medical condition (n 
= 1), or had a scheduling conflict (n = 4). There were no 
statistically significant differences in the demographic or 
clinical characteristics of participants in the USMART– 
usual care sequence (n = 23) vs those in the usual care– 
USMART sequence (n = 20) 
in the ITT population 
(Table 1). After study initiation, one participant in the 
USMART–usual care sequence dropped out after ses- 
sion 5 of the first period because of acute renal failure. 
In the 
from the 
second period, one participant 
USMART–usual care sequence dropped because they 
were no longer willing to participate after session 4. 
There were no adverse events related to USMART

Efficacy 
Changes in WLMT, WLRT, WLRcT, SMCQ, GDS, and 
MMSE scores are presented in Table 2. USMART was 
more beneficial than usual care for improving measures 
of memory recall 
function (1.12 ± 1.56 vs 0.36 ± 1.56 
points, respectively; effect size = 0.49; p = 0.031) for the 
WMRT. In the USMART period, 62.8% of participants 
showed improvement in WLRT score, whereas in the 
usual care period, only 35.7% of participants showed im- 
(p = 0.013). Among secondary measures, 
provement 
there were no significant differences in changes in GDS, 
SMCQ, or MMSE scores between the USMART and 
usual care periods. Carryover effects of the first period 
were not significant for any primary or secondary out- 
come measures (p > 0.1). 
Discussion 
In this study, we found that biweekly self-administration 
of USMART over a 4-week period was more effective 
than usual care for improving memory function in pa- 
tients with MCI. Operation of the USMART application 
seemed to be simple and easy for patients with MCI, be- 
cause no patients dropped out due to difficulty with the 
application. To our knowledge, this is the first RCT on 
the efficacy of self-administered computerized SRT. 
Previous RCTs indicate that SRT is effective in im- 
proving training content-associated tests in various cog- 
nitive domains 
such as personal 
information recall [31], name–face association [31], in- 
strumental activities of daily living [32], and problematic 
behaviors such as eating difficulty [33]. However, these

studies did not find a generalization of the SRT ef- 
fects to neuropsychological tests independent of train- 
ing content in the SRT [31, 32], except in a measure 
of attention [31]. 
In the current RCT, USMART improved performance 
in patients with MCI on the WLRT, which uses a set of 
words that are different from those in the training con- 
tent of USMART. According to Valenzuela and Sachdev 
[34], generalization can happen at multiple levels. These 
include transfer to nontrained tasks in the same cogni- 
tive domain, transfer to nontrained tasks in other cogni- 
tive domains, transfer to global measures of general 
cognitive ability, and transfer to measures of general 
function. The transfer to nontrained tasks in the same 
cognitive domain is the lowest level and that to mea- 
sures of general function is the highest level in the hier- 
archy of generalization [34]. Therefore, the current study 
directly shows that the efficacy of USMART can be 
transferred to other nontrained tasks in the same cogni- 
tive domain (i.e., WLRT), which is the lowest level of 
generalization. Furthermore, USMART could not im- 
prove MMSE (a measure of global cognition) and SMCQ 
(a measure of function) scores. This indicates that the 
efficacy of USMART cannot be transferred to general 
cognitive ability or function. Although we did not meas- 
ure performance in other cognitive domains in the 
current study, the efficacy of USMART may not be 
transferred to nontrained measures of other cognitive 
domains. This is because these effects were not trans- 
ferred to the WLMT and WLRcT, which are measures of 
memory function, although they test different processes 
of memory 
the 
generalizability of USMART should be investigated in 
future research, because the duration of treatment in 
this study was short and the sample size was small. In 
addition, whether improvements due to SRT using dif- 
ferent types of memory, such as stories or designs, can 
also be transferred to other nontrained tasks in the same 
cognitive domain warrants further research. 


The effect size of USMART on the WLRT was modest 
[30]. One recent meta-analysis reported that the effect 
of computerized cognitive training on cognition in indi- 
viduals with MCI is moderate [16]. Another systematic 
review reported that the effect sizes of memory strategy 
trainings ranged from –1.18 to 0.88 in individuals with 
MCI [35]. Although there have been no clinical trials to 
investigate the effect size of SRT in patients with MCI, a 
meta-analysis of the effects of SRT on semantic memory 
in patients with mild AD reported that the effect sizes 
varied substantially from 0.67 to 37.97 across studies 
[10]. The authors attributed the wide variation in the ef- 
fect size of SRT between studies to differences in proto- 
cols for SRT, sizes of study samples, outcome measures, 
and quality of the clinical trials [10]. 

the effects of 
SRT generalize to standardized neuropsychological 
tests of memory function in the patients with AD or 
dementia [13, 31]. Conventional neuropsychological 
tests for memory function require more cognitive ef- 
fort and explicit memory than the new learning in 
SRT, which mainly uses implicit memory [36]. Pa- 
tients with AD have more severe explicit memory im- 
pairments 
the 
efficacy of SRT is less likely to be transferred to 
neuropsychological tests in the same cognitive domain 
in patients with AD when compared to those with 
MCI. 


Before USMART, SRTs were implemented in com- 
puters [17] or mobile devices [37]. Computerized cog- 
nitive training received significant attention as a more 
cost-effective and accessible option compared to trad- 
itional paper-and-pencil cognitive training [38]. Tablet 
computers in particular have more advantages in their 
portability and flexibility for delivering a variety of 
tasks [39]. Limited adaptability to new technology is a 
common concern for the application of computerized 
cognitive training in older patients and patients with 
cognitive 
two studies have 
already shown that cognitive training using iPads is 
effective in improving episodic memory and process- 
ing speed in older people [39, 40]. The older individ- 
uals with MCI 
successfully used USMART with 
minimal technical support in the current study, and 
those with early-stage AD, all of whom were first- 
time mobile device users, also successfully used the 
tablet-based SRT in a previous study [18]. Therefore, 
a well-designed mobile user interface may become 
quite applicable as a platform for delivering cognitive 
training, such as SRT, to older individuals or patients 
with cognitive impairment. 
The present study had several limitations. First, this 
study was not double-blinded. Second, we employed 
usual care as a control 
instead of mock therapy. 
Third, our sample size was relatively small, but was 
notably consistent with most previous RCTs on SRT 
[9, 31, 32, 41]. Fourth, subtypes and causes of MCI 
were not adjusted for in the analysis. Fifth, the dur- 
ation of treatment was too short to test the efficacy 
of USMART on general cognition or function. The 
efficacy of USMART increased with increasing num- 
bers of training sessions in our previous uncontrolled 
trial 
the differences in outcome 
measures between the USMART group and the usual 
care group might have been attenuated due to learn- 
ing effects, because the intervals between the out- 
come measurements were relatively short 
(Fig. 2). 
Sixth, we did not evaluate how long the improvement 
in the WLRT lasted.
