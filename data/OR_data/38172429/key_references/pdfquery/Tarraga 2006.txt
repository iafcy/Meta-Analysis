Objective: To determine the usefulness of an interactive multimedia internet-based system (IMIS) for the 
cognitive stimulation of Alzheimer’s disease. 
Methods: This is a 24-week, single-blind, randomised pilot study conducted on 46 mildly impaired 
patients suspected of having Alzheimer’s disease receiving stable treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors 
(ChEIs). The patients were divided into three groups: (1) those who received 3 weekly, 20-min sessions of 
IMIS in addition to 8 h/day of an integrated psychostimulation program (IPP); (2) those who received only 
IPP sessions; and (3) those who received only ChEI treatment. The primary outcome measure was the 
Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog). Secondary outcome measures were: Mini- 
Mental State Examination (MMSE), Syndrom Kurztest, Boston Naming Test, Verbal Fluency, and the 
Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test story recall subtest. 
Results: After 12 weeks, the patients treated with both IMIS and IPP had improved outcome scores on the 
ADAS-Cog and MMSE, which was maintained through 24 weeks of follow-up. The patients treated with 
IPP alone had better outcome than those treated with ChEIs alone, but the effects were attenuated after 
24 weeks. All patients had improved scores in all of the IMIS individual tasks, attaining higher levels of 
difficulty in all cases. 
Conclusion: Although both the IPP and IMIS improved cognition in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, the 
IMIS program provided an improvement above and beyond that seen with IPP alone, which lasted for 
24 weeks. 


form of 
dementia in elderly people,1 2 and its current treatment 
includes cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs),3–5 and N- 
methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockers 
(eg, memantine).6 
However, symptomatic treatment often entails non-pharma- 
cological treatments as well, and adequate dementia manage- 
ment requires a wide range of intervention to help maximise 
the patient’s independence, 
increase their self-confidence 
and relieve burden to the care giver. 
Current symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer’s disease can 
improve cognition and functionality.3–6 However, before the 
emergence of these drugs, non-pharmacological treatments 
had already been evaluated and cognitive stimulation had 
been found to be potentially beneficial for patients with 
dementia.7–9 Although these non-pharmacological treatments 
do not always seem efficacious, methodological problems 
may limit the validity of some studies.10 A recent Cochrane 
review11 emphasised caution when interpreting the results of 
non-pharmacological treatments, but suggested that certain 
cognitive domains could, in fact, benefit from these types of 
interventions. 
Clinical and laboratory studies have shown that mental 
and physical activity can positively influence cognition in 
normal elderly people and people with dementia. Education12 
and lifestyle choices (eg, occupation and leisure activities)13–15 
can modulate the risk of developing dementia, and psycho- 
motor stimulation improves cognition in patients with 
Alzheimer’s disease.16 17 Environmental enrichment 
can 
improve cognition in transgenic mice.18 19 Despite the 
continued deposition of b-amyloid, exercise can increase 
the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor20 and may 
reduce amyloid burden.21 

Despite the progressive nature of the degenerative process, 
patients with Alzheimer’s disease also seem to retain the 
physiological capacity to alter brain structure and function. 
Recent studies have shown cognitive plasticity and learning 
potential not only in patients with Alzheimer’s disease but 
also in healthy elders.22 23 Positron emission tomography 
studies that used activation paradigms24 25 have found that 
people with Alzheimer’s disease have a greater activation 
than those without dementia in the brain regions usually 
associated with memory tasks, as well as in the frontal lobes 
that were activated only with increasing difficulty of tasks. 
Pathological studies conducted on biopsy specimens of 
patients with Alzheimer’s disease with mild or moderate 
dementia have shown increased synaptic contact size.26 Thus, 
the brain may be able to compensate during the early stages 
of Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that there may be some 
utility to non-pharmacological adjunctive interventions. 
Although studies on cognitive stimulation show that it is 
possible to stimulate the memory of patients with Alzheimer’s 
disease, the results are often modest. Because of methodolo- 
gical limitations, there is a need to conduct more randomised- 
controlled trials with larger samples to validate this therapeutic 
approach. Computerised systems27 and internet-based distance 
programs offer one potential mechanism by which non- 
pharmacological cognitive stimulation can be conducted in

patients with dementia. In this study, we evaluated an 
interactive multimedia internet-based system (IMIS) as an 
adjunct to ChEI treatment and classic psychostimulation 
treatment. 


MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Forty six patients suspected of having Alzheimer’s disease28 
were recruited for the study through a referral clinic and 
de 
daycare 
Neurocie`ncies Aplicades, Barcelona, Spain). The Institut 
Catala` de Neurocie`ncies Aplicades is a referral diagnostic 
clinic for community-dwelling people with dementia, and 
also provides adult daycare services to these patients. All of 
the patients had been treated with ChEIs for at least 1 year 
before inclusion to the study. The inclusion criteria were: 

N .65 years of age; 
N at least 3 years of education; 
N a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)29 30 score 
N a Global Deterioration Scale (GDS)31 score of 3 or 4; 
N absence of uncontrolled disruptive behaviours (eg, aggres- 

sion, delusions, hallucinations and agitation) that could 
interfere with program administration and/or neuro- 
psychological assessments; 
N absence of major depression, current or partial remission32; 
N absence of structural lesions in the computed tomogram or 
N absence of history of alcohol or other substance abuse; and 
N absence of severe auditory, visual or motor deficits that 


None of the participants had previous experience with a 
personal computer and all attended the daycare centre 
5 days/week. Participants were allowed to be on stable doses 
of psychotropic drugs. 
Multimedia treatment 
The IMIS was conducted using Smartbrain (http://www. 
educamigos.com), an interactive multimedia tool that allows 
patients to carry out a variety of different stimulation 
programs, at different levels of difficulty and at various 
times during the day. Briefly, the IMIS program consists of 19 
separate ‘‘tasks’’ or stimulation exercises across the domains 
of attention, calculation, gnosis, 
language, memory and 
orientation. All participants began at the lowest level of 
difficulty (first of 15 levels) and the program monitored 
activity at each level. Difficulty increased automatically after 
three consecutive performances within a single task without 
error, or when a patient was 80% correct over six consecutive 
sessions. A patient’s level of difficulty decreased when his or 
her performance fell below 15% correct for three consecutive 
sessions or ,20% correct for six consecutive sessions. All 
patients were trained before the study with the use of the 
computer mouse, especially on how to ‘‘click and drag’’. 
Integrated psychostimulation program 
The IPP is a daily program in the daycare centre that includes 
cognitive stimulation tasks, workshops (eg, music therapy, 
art and crafts, and physical activity) and reinforcement of 
instrumental activities of daily living.17 The IPP is integrated 
into the daycare centre activities, and it takes 2 h in the 
morning and 1.5 h in the afternoon out of the 8 h that the 
patients spend in the centre. 



N Experimental group: These patients received the IMIS, as 
N IPP control: These patients received IPP and ChEIs. 
N ChEIs control: These patients received only ChEIs. 
The ChEIs group comprised of patients who were 
diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, but who were living at 
home, and never received the IPP or the IMIS. These patients 
either did not want to come to the daycare centre, although 
they agree to be followed clinically, or were on a waiting list 
for admission to the daycare centre. The experimental and 
the IPP control groups were participants in the daycare 
centre, and the only difference between these two groups was 
the experiment group received the IMIS. Written 
that 
informed consent was obtained from all the participants 
enrolled in the study and their legal representative before the 
study onset. 
Three patients in the experimental group dropped out of 
the study: one because of rapid progression of the disease and 
two because of institutionalisation. Consequently, from the 
initial sample of 46, 43 patients completed the study: 15 in 
the experimental group, 16 in the IPP control group and 12 in 
the ChEI control group (table 1). 
Experimental group 
These patients received the IMIS, IPP and ChEIs. 
IPP control

No significant differences were observed between the 
groups in terms of age (F2,41 = 0.72) or level of education 
(x2 = 5.513, df = 4, p = 0.239). There was a tendency for a 
difference in the proportion of male patients, primarily 
because all the patients in the ChEI group were female; 
however, the difference was not significant (x2 = 5.70, df = 2, 
p = 0.06). 
Patients were assessed at study entry, and after 12 and 
24 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome measure was 
the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS- 
Cog) section.33 This is a standardised measure of cognitive 
function that examines components of memory, language, 
visuoconstructional and ideational praxis, and orientation. 
High ADAS-Cog scores indicate worse performance. The 
secondary measures were: 

examines orientation to time and place, immediate and 
delayed recall of three words, attention and calculation, 
language and visuoconstructional functions.

cognitive and functional stages, ranging from normal 
(stage 0) to severe dementia (stage 7). All patients in the 
study had a GDS stage 4. 
The primary and secondary outcome measures were 
administered to all participants in the experimental and IPP 
control groups at all visits. Owing to manpower limitations, 
the BNT, verbal fluency tests and RBMT (all secondary 
outcome measures) were not administered to the ChEI 
control group at any visit. 
INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA INTERVENTION 
Patients in the experimental group received a total of 72 IMIS 
sessions, three times a week for 24 weeks. All of the patients 
in the experimental group had the same computerised 
activities, order of presentation and session length. During 
the first 24 sessions, the IMIS sessions lasted only 15 min. 
Sessions 25–28 lasted 20 min, and sessions 29–72 lasted 
time that such a 
25 min. Because this was the first 
computerised multimedia program was applied for 
the 
cognitive stimulation of these patients, it was necessary to 
ensure tolerability and adequate dose to avoid fatigue or 
other possible negative effects that might arise from exposure 
to a PC. A minimum requirement was that the participants 
completed 58 of 72 (80%) sessions, with an interruption of no 
more than 10 days between sessions; all participants met this 
criterion. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
The data were analysed using SPSS V.12. Descriptive 
statistics were prepared at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. 
Outcomes were assessed using one-way analysis of variance 
at each of the three critical time points. 
RESULTS 
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the groups. 
No significant differences were observed between the three 
study groups on the ADAS-Cog (F2,42 = 0.67) or SKT 
(F2,42 = 0.84) at baseline, although the experimental group 
had slightly lower MMSE scores than the other groups 
(F2,42 = 3.33, p = 0.046; table 2). There were no differences 
between the experimental and the IPP control groups on the 
other neuropsychological measures at baseline examination 
(the ChEI control group did not receive these additional four 
tests; table 2). 


the three study groups 
differed in terms of the ADAS-Cog (F2,42 = 7.05, p = 0.002, 
r = 0.50) and the MMSE (F2,42 = 10.3, p,0.001, r = 0.57; 
fig 1). Both experimental and IPP control groups were 
superior to the ChEI control group on the ADAS-Cog (D- 
lysergic acid diethylamide test, p,0.05), and all three groups 

differed from each other on the MMSE (D-lysergic acid 
diethylamide test, p,0.05). After 24 weeks, group differences 
were still apparent on the ADAS-Cog (F2,42 = 3.08, p = 0.06, 
and MMSE (F2,42 = 8.48, p = 001, 
r = 0.36) 
r = 0.54). 
Reanalyses showed that the experimental group was better 
than the ChEI control group on the ADAS-Cog (p,0.05), 
whereas the experimental and IPP control groups differed 
from the ChEIs control group on the MMSE (p,0.05; fig 2). 
There was no significant change in SKT scores over 24 weeks 
across all three groups (F2,39 = 0.83), and no significant 
group by time interaction (F2,39 = 1.93, p = 0.11, r = 0.30). 


No significant differences were observed in the functional 
assessments, as measured by the RDRS-2 at baseline 
examination (experimental group mean: 26.6 (SD 0.96), 
IPP control: 27.3 (0.93), ChEI control: 24.4 (1.0); F2,42 = 2.16, 
p = 0.12, r = 0.32), or after 24 weeks of follow-up (experi- 
mental group: 25.3 (1.1), IPP control: 25.6 (1.0), ChEI 
control: 23.7 (1.2); F2,42 = 0.76, p = 0.47 , r = 0.14). The GDS 
stage was 4 in all patients at baseline and in all follow-up 
evaluations. 
Figure 3 shows the mean difficulty level obtained by the 
patients over the course of the 24 weeks of treatment in each 
of the six cognitive domains of the IMIS. Performance in all 
cognitive domains showed an improvement, but most 
especially in the measures of attention and memory. In no 
case did a patient’s performance level for any individual 
activity actually decline over the course of the 24 weeks. 
DISCUSSION 
This study shows that both classic cognitive stimulation 
treatment and computer-based treatment improved cognition 
in patients who were treated with a stable dose of ChEI, 
compared with those who were treated only with ChEIs. In 
addition, the IMIS program provided an improvement above 
and beyond that seen with classic cognitive stimulation, with 
improvement lasting 24 weeks. Not only did ADAS-Cog and 
MMSE scores fail to decline (as was seen in the ChEIs control 
group) but scores also actually improved, and the improve- 
ment was maintained over the 24 weeks that the IMIS was 
part of the treatment programme. 
The progression of illness observed in the ChEI control 
group is consistent with what has previously been described 
in subjects with prolonged exposure to ChEIs (.1 year).38 On 
average, this group declined at a rate of approximately 2–3 
MMSE points per year, which is slightly slower than is 
typical, but falls within the range of expected decline in mild 
Alzheimer’s disease.39 
These results show that it is possible to augment the effects 
of cholinesterase inhibition using cognitive stimulation 
procedures, with the result that patients have improved 
outcomes. These findings from the experimental group 
cannot be explained simply by increased social contact or 
interactions, as the experimental group and the IPP control 
group attended the daycare centre. The IMIS greatly 
augmented the traditional psychomotor stimulation, because 
when both treatments were used together efficacy was 
extended to 24 weeks. Thus, it seems that an individually 
constrained cognitive stimulation program such as the IMIS 
used here is more efficacious than treatment only with drugs, 
and at least augments traditional psychostimulation. In 
regard to the possible effects of IMIS-alone treatment, we 
hypothesise that it would represent an improvement com- 
pared with non-treated patients and also with patients 
treated with ChEIs alone, as shown in previous studies.27 40 
The degree of difficulty of the problems is individually 
adjusted to maximise success (and increase the challenges) 
the 
for each patient. Although an understanding of 


physiological basis of the efficacy of these individualised 
cognitive stimulation programs is beyond the scope of this 
initial study, our findings and data from others suggest that 
plasticity remains possible in patients with Alzheimer’s 
disease at the cellular level, and that these changes can 
modify disease progression.22–26 Cellular plasticity could thus 
provide a substrate on which the improvements observed 
here could be based. 
No functional improvement was noted among the three 
groups. This may be explained by the fact that these were 
mildly impaired patients (mean MMSE was 22.0), who 
retained the physical or functional ability to participate in a 
cognitive or motor stimulation program, and did not exhibit 
disruptive behaviours. Similarly, the ChEI control group was 
only mildly impaired, and they had sufficient support from 
their care giver to come to the clinic for frequent evaluations. 
Therefore, any change in functional capacity could have been 
more difficult to measure in this cohort than in patients in 
moderate or severe stages of dementia. In addition, it is 
possible that the functional measures used in this study were 
not sensitive enough to detect subtle change. 
There have been multiple methodological approaches to 
explore the benefits of non-pharmacological treatments in 
patients with Alzheimer’s disease. These included studies of: 


other cognitive functions43 or activities of daily living 
(ADLs)44; 


N training in ADLs (procedural memory stimulation) and its 
N psychosocial intervention programmes (ie, reality orienta- 
N combination of cognitive stimulation and counselling 
N combination of cognitive rehabilitation with mental 
N combination of cognitive enhancers and computerised 
N comprehensive cognitive and motor stimulation pro- 




Although these approaches show varying degree of benefits 
from non-pharmacological 
interventions in patients with 
Alzheimer’s disease, it is difficult to establish comparisons 
among studies, as the outcome measures and duration of the 
interventions were not the same, especially when compared 
with drug trials. Studies of non-pharmacological interven- 
tions should, therefore, use the same outcome measures and 
study duration as the pharmacological trials to provide a 
better perspective of the effects of non-pharmacological 
treatments. This study used the ADAS-Cog and MMSE, 
which are the standard cognitive measures used in drug 
trials; participants who had cognitive or motor stimulation

treatment had improved scores, and this effect was enhanced 
by the use of a computerised program. 
One of the limitations of the study is that we were unable 
to complete the neuropsychological battery (secondary out- 
comes) in the ChEI control group. Therefore, we could not 
further expand our analysis to specific cognitive domains. 
The improvement seen with the ADAS-Cog and the MMSE 
was not seen with the SKT. This discrepancy could be 
these treatments have 
explained by assessing whether 
beneficial effects in some cognitive domains, and not in 
others. However, the limited scope of the cognitive functions 
assessed by the SKT, and a possible ceiling effect in mildly 
impaired patients can also explain these findings. 
The patients in the experimental and the IPP control 
groups were in the daycare centre; the only difference 
between the groups was that the experimental group received 
the IMIS. Patients in these groups were drawn from the same 
institution, where the IPP program is used in all patients. 
Therefore, we could not create a group of patients receiving 
daycare only, as patients could not be isolated from their 
daily stimulation routines (which are an integral part of the 
daycare program). 
Figure 3 Mean levels of difficulty attained by the experimental group 
on each cognitive function over a 24-week training period. 

Although this was a trial of a non-pharmacological 
intervention, one way to conceptualise the design is to 
consider that we were able to evaluate ‘‘dose’’ and ‘‘toler- 
ability’’. In this context, the ‘‘dose’’ refers to the amount of 
time each day that a patient could engage in the IMIS. 
Similarly, we could consider the patient’s willingness to 
complete the assigned tests on schedule as a measure of 
‘‘tolerability’’. Therefore, we started with sessions of 15 min 
of duration and increased them to 25 min, and all patients 
completed the minimum requirement of 58 sessions. 
Future research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of the 
IMIS-type programs in larger, more diverse populations to 
understand factors that may modify the response, as well as 
to establish its long-term effects (.1 year). The IMIS should 
be tested outside the controlled clinical environment (ie, 
home-based) to determine the efficacy of ‘‘distance therapy’’ 
in Alzheimer’s disease. Nevertheless, the results of this study 
suggest that this is a promising avenue of approach to help 
maximise a patient’s cognitive functions in the context of a 
progressive degenerative disease, potentially altering the 
effect of the condition on both the patients and the care 
givers.
