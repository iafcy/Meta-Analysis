Cognitive disabilities are often the most disabling 
and distressing for stroke survivors, caregivers, 
family members, and society.1 Persistent cognitive 
deficits after stroke can significantly impair inde- 
pendence, activities of daily living (ADL), and 
active participation in the community.2 Post- 
stroke cognitive impairment and rehabilitation 
have been recognized as a top research priority.3 
A systematic review showed computer-based cog- 
nitive training is likely to provide some benefit in 
cognitive functions for stroke survivors.4 The 
improvements in computer-based cognitive train- 
ing were training specific (i.e. only outcomes 
similar to those tasks trained improved). Physical 
exercise is another intervention that may contri- 
bute positively by attenuating a decline in cognitive 
function in stroke survivors.5 A systematic review 
examined whether physical exercise interventions 
improved cognitive function after stroke; a meta- 
analysis of nine studies showed a significant 
improvement in cognitive function with an effect 
size of 0.20.5 The authors suggested that aerobic 
exercise may increase the arousal level and reduce 
depressive symptoms, which in turn leads to better 
cognitive function (e.g. higher scores on the Mini- 
Mental State Examination, MMSE).5 Another sys- 
tematic review confirmed the beneficial role of

ABSTRACT 
Purpose: The objectives are to evaluate the effects of a sequential combination of aerobic exercise 
and cognitive training, compared with exercise or cognitive training alone, on cognitive function, 
physical function, daily function, quality of life, and social participation in stroke survivors with 
cognitive impairment. 
Methods: This is a single-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial. Stroke patients with mild 
cognitive impairment (n = 56) were randomly assigned to aerobic exercise training (n = 18), 
computerized cognitive training (n = 18), and the sequential combination of aerobic exercise and 
computerized cognitive training (n = 20) group. All groups underwent training 60 min/day, 3 days/ 
week, for a total of 12 weeks. The primary outcomes included Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA), Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition, and the Stroop color-word test. Secondary outcomes 
were the Timed Up and Go test, 6-Minute Walk Test, Functional Independence Measure, Lawton 
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, Community Integration Questionnaire, and Stroke 
Impact Scale. 
Results: 56 participants completed the trial. Compared with a single type of aerobic exercise or 
cognitive training, the combined training group showed significant improvement in MoCA (P < .05, 
η2 = 0.13), and two sub-tests in WMS-III (both P’s < 0.05) following the intervention. However, no 
between-group differences were observed for physical functions, daily function, quality of life, and 
social participation measures. 
Conclusions: The findings provide evidence for the potential synergistic intervention in stroke 
survivors. Future studies investigating the transfer effects and the optimal training parameters with 
a larger sample is needed. 





aerobic exercise in multiple domains of cognitive 
functions such as global cognitive ability and a 
potential benefit to memory, attention, and the 
visuospatial domain of cognition.6 
combination 
training 
approaches might be the most promising strategy 
to delay cognitive decline and preserve cognitive 
abilities. A review of multidomain interventions 
suggests that strategies that target multiple factors, 
such as exercise, mental training, and weight man- 
agement, may be more effective in reducing cogni- 
tive decline in older adults than those focusing on a 
single factor.7 Physical activity and cognitive train- 
ing might interact to induce a larger functional 
benefit in elderly individuals.8 Liu-Ambrose experi- 
mented with a 6-month exercise and recreation 
program on executive functions in individuals 
with chronic stroke and found that the combined 
exercise and recreation program significantly bene- 
fited executive functions in individuals who were 
mildly cognitively impaired.9 The potential to 
further enhance cognitive training benefits is to 
‘prime’ the brain by delivering aerobic exercise 
training prior to cognitive training. Aerobic exer- 
cise may increase arousal level, facilitate neurogen- 
esis, and enhance memory consolidation, which 
may be more responsive to cognitive intervention 
protocols that follow.10,11 
Specific training effects of cognitive training and 
physical exercise training on cognitive functions in 
older adults and patients with Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (MCI) are well documented; however, 
there is limited but promising evidence on the 
investigation of the combined effect of cognitive 
and physical training in stroke survivors with cog- 
nitive impairment. There is a need to take into 
account whether a combined approach may lead 
to additive effects in monotype approaches and 
spontaneous recovery. The present randomized 
trial evaluated the effects of a sequential combina- 
tion of aerobic exercise and cognitive training, 
compared with exercise or cognitive training 
alone, on cognitive function, physical function, 
daily function, quality of life, and social participa- 
tion in stroke survivors with cognitive impairment. 
We hypothesized that the combination of aerobic 
exercise and cognitive training would induce more 
beneficial cognitive and physical effects and would 
transfer to daily function, quality of life, and social 
participation than pure cognitive and physical 
interventions alone. 

This randomized trial used a 2 × 3 factorial design 
that evaluated the clinical effectiveness of a sequen- 
tial combination program of aerobic exercise com- 
bined with computer-based cognitive training for 
the treatment of cognitive dysfunction after stroke 
(see study protocol12). The study recruited stroke 
survivors with cognitive impairment who were ran- 
domly divided into three groups: an aerobic exer- 
cise training group (AE), a cognitive training group 
(COG), and a sequential combination of aerobic 
exercise and cognitive training (SEQ). The rando- 
mization scheme was generated with the web-based 
Research Randomizer randomization tool (avail- 
able at http://www.randomizer.org/). All partici- 
pants received face-to-face individualized training 
in the hospitals by certified physical and/or occupa- 
tional therapists for 60 minutes per day, 3 days per 
week for 12 weeks. Each participant completed a 
total number of 36 sessions. 


This study was approved by the centralized ethics 
committee (IRB# 104-4892A3) and registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov 
NCT02550990. 
Written informed consent was obtained from all 
participants prior to their participation in the 
study. The design and reporting of this study fol- 
lows the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials) guidelines. 

This study was conducted in the outpatient units of 
the Departments of Neurology and Rehabilitation 
at Chang Gung Memorial Hospitals at five branches 
(Taoyuan, Chiayi, Kaohsiung, Keelung, and Taipei) 
in Taiwan. Participants were recruited via a clinic 
database based on diagnosis and medical referrals; 
interested participants met with the study person- 
nel to receive all necessary information. The parti- 
cipants resolved uncertainties and were invited to 
sign informed consent after an assessment of elig- 
ibility criteria. The inclusion criteria were (1) 
unilateral ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke occur- 
ring at least 6 months before enrollment; (2) age 
between 20 and 90 years; (3) Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) score ≥19; (4) Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) <26; (5) self- 
reported or informant-reported memory or cogni- 
tive complaints or Clinical Dementia Rating Scale 
(CDR) score ≤0.5; (6) able to follow the study 
instruction; (7) adequate cardiopulmonary func- 
tion to perform the aerobic exercise; and (8) able 
to walk with or without assistive devices for 10 m. 
Participants were excluded if they (1) had an 
unstable medical history such as recent myocardial 
infarction that might limit participation; (2) had 
other neurologic disorders; or (3) currently partici- 
pate in other clinical trials. A priori power analysis 
(G*Power software 3.1) was used to estimate the 
number of participants needed for this project. On 
the basis of Kim et al.,13 the estimated sample size 
requirement is 15 patients for each group in a 
three-group study design given the lowest effect 
size (f = 0.30), power of 0.80, and two-sided type I 
error of 0.05. Allowing for 10% attrition at the end 
of the intervention, we planned to recruit 18 parti- 
cipants for each group. 

AE training 
The participants in the AE group performed pro- 
training14 
gressive resistive stationary bicycle 
(Figure 1). The participants first underwent 



10 minutes of warm-up, followed by 45 minutes 
of resistive aerobic exercise, followed by 5 minutes 
of cool-down. The target heart rate during the 
aerobic period was 40–70% of the participant’s 
(HRmax), calculated as 
maximal heart 
(208 − 0.7 × age).15 The exercise intensity pro- 
gressed as the participants improved their perfor- 
mance. The exercise intensity was increased from 
the initial 40–50% gradually increased to 60–70% 
HRmax over the 12 weeks. The therapist monitored 
closely for any adverse effects of the increased exer- 
cise intensity and downward adjustments if the 
exercise is not tolerated during the session. 

COG training 
The participants in the COG group received 
computer-based 
using 
cognitive 
BrainHQ software (Posit Science 
Inc., San 
Francisco, CA, USA)16 (e.g. BrainHQ software 
includes different training programs that are 
designed to restore attention, recognition, color 
and shape identification, calculation, visual per- 
ception, visuospatial processing, memory, and 
executive function). Participants performed a 
variety of tasks designed to enhance different 
cognitive functions. During the training sessions, 
laptops with touchscreens were provided so that 
the participants performed the interactive com- 
puter-based games without manipulating a 
mouse (Figure 2). The training program was 
adjusted automatically and continuously accord- 
ing to each participant’s level of performance. 




Each cognitive 
60 minutes. 

SEQ training 
The participants in the SEQ group underwent 
aerobic exercise training for 30 minutes, fol- 
lowed by 30 minutes of computer-based cogni- 
tive training (Figure 3). The aerobic exercise 
training was conducted using the progressive 
resistive stationary bicycle as in the AE group 
with the same training principle. The partici- 
pants performed 3 minutes of warm-up, fol- 
lowed by 25 minutes of aerobic resistive 
exercise, and ended with 2 minutes of cool- 
down. After the aerobic exercise training, the 
participants took part in 30 minutes of compu- 
ter-based cognitive training as 
in the COG 
group. The principles of the training program 
were the same as those of the cognitive training 
group. The SEQ program was also adjusted 
automatically and continuously according to 
each participant’s level of performance. 

Cognitive and functional assessments were mea- 
sured at baseline and at the end of the intervention 
at 12 weeks. The evaluator for the assessments was 
blinded to the group allocation. 





Primary outcome measures were cognitive func- 
tions as assessed by MoCA, Wechsler Memory 
Scale-Third Edition (WMS-III), and the Stroop 
Color and Word Test.17,18 MoCA is a screening 
instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction, and it 
assesses six different cognitive domains, including 
short-term memory; visuospatial abilities; executive 
functions; attention, concentration, and working 
memory; language; and orientation to time and 
place. The WMS-III is a standardized and reliable 
neuropsychological examination tool designed to 
evaluate visuospatial and memory functions. Face 
recognition, verbal paired associates, word lists, 
and spatial span of the WMS-III subtests were 
used to assess the immediate, delayed, and working 
memory.18 The Stroop Color and Word Test was 
used to assess the abilities of selective attention, 
inhibition, and executive function.19 


Secondary measures included physical functions, 
ADL, instrumental AD (IADL), quality of life 
(QOL), and social participation. Physical functions 
were measured by the 6-Minute Walk Test 
(6MWT) and 
test 
(TUG).20,21 The 6MWT measures the maximum 
distance walked over 6 minutes and is a common 
tool to assess the endurance and mobility levels. 
The TUG is a performance-based measure of func- 
tional mobility by asking the participants to stand 
up from a chair, walk 3 m, return to the chair, and 
sit down. The Functional Independence Measure 
(FIM) and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily 
Living Scale (Lawton IADL) were used to evaluate 
ADLs and IADL.22,23 The Lawton IADL is an 
instrument used to assess independent living skills 
such as the ability to use telephone or managing 
own medications. The QOL was assessed with the 
Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) 3.0.24 The SIS is a self- 
report questionnaire that evaluates disability and 
health-related QOL, such as emotion, communica- 
tion, memory and thinking, and social role function 
after stroke. The participant’s level of social parti- 
cipation was measured using the Community 
Integration Questionnaire (CIQ).25 CIQ is a brief, 
reliable measure of an individual’s level of integra- 
tion into the home and community. 
All statistical analyses were performed using PASW 
Statistics 18.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 
The normality of the data was checked using the 
Shapiro–Wilks test and non-normally distributed 
variables were rank transformed to achieve normal- 
ity, followed by analysis with parametric tests. The 
baseline characteristics of the participants were com- 
pared using chi-square (χ2) tests and the Fisher's exact 
test. A 2 times (pre vs. post) × 3 groups (AE vs. COG 
vs. SEQ) mixed ANOVA with repeated measures on 
the time factor was conducted for all the outcome 
measures. If a significant interaction was found, the 
least significant differences post hoc analyses were 
conducted. We used the Huynh–Feldt correction 
factor when the data violated the sphericity assump- 
tion (Mauchly test, p < .05). The effect size (partial eta 
squared, η2) was calculated to determine the group 
difference for each outcome measure. The effect size 
greater than 0.138 is considered to be a large effect; 
between 0.138 and 0.059 is a moderate effect, and 
between 0.01 and 0.059 is a small effect.26 For all tests, 
the statistical significance was set at p < .05. 


Initially, 84 stroke survivors were selected and 
referred from the department, 28 of them were 
ineligible. Specifically, 28 interested stroke survi- 
vors were excluded due to several reasons: cognitive 
intact (n = 7), severe cognitive decline (n = 13), 
currently participating in another study (n = 3), and 
refused to participate (n = 5). Overall, 56 stroke 
survivors with cognitive impairment were rando- 
mized and divided into the SEQ (n = 20), AE 
(n = 18), and COG (n = 18) groups and were used 
in the final analysis. Figure 4 shows the CONSORT 
flow diagram. No significant differences in the 
baseline demographic characteristics were detected 
among the groups (p > .05 for all; Table 1). 

The mixed-factor analysis of variance revealed a 
significant group × time interactions for MoCA 
(F2,53 = 4.05, p = .023), Word List II (F2,53 = 3.99, 
p = .024), and Word List IA delayed (F2,53 = 4.60, p 



= .014; Table 2). To examine this interaction, the 
least significant difference post hoc analysis showed 
that after the training, the SEQ group improved to a 
significantly higher amount in the MoCA com- 
pared with the AE (p = .019) and COG groups (p 
= .017), but no between-group difference was found 
for the AE and COG groups (p > .05). Similar 
results were also shown for Word List II that the 
SEQ group significantly improved compared with 
the AE (p = .019) and the COG groups (p = .024). 
Finally, for the Word List IA delayed, the SEQ and 
COG groups both performed better than the AE 
group (SEQ: p = .010; COG: p = .018).

For the secondary measures in TUG, 6MWT, FIM,

Comparisons of the three groups showed that the 
sequential combination training resulted in the lar- 
gest improvement of the general cognitive function 
evaluated by MoCA compared to the single type of 
training. These results partially support our 
hypotheses that combined aerobic exercise and 
cognitive training engender larger cognitive effects

effects of improving general cognitive function 
after stroke in favor of combined treatment were 
observed. However, no significant group difference 
was shown in physical functions and other health- 
related outcomes. 

Aerobic exercise has been shown to enhance 
post-stroke cognitive performance in the Trail- 
Making test, Serial Addition test, and Stroop 
test.14,27,28 The findings of our study are partially 
consistent with the results of prior research in 
that aerobic exercise not only 
supporting 
improves 
(e.g. 
general 
MoCA) but also optimizes memory function 
measured by four subtests of WMS-III. Aerobic 
exercise may lead to upregulation of neuro- 
trophic and vascular growth factors, such as 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor.29 We specu- 
lated that AE does not involve the practice of 
specific cognitive 
improving 
tasks and 
results on these specific cognitive tests might 
not be easy. Yet, AE improved brain blood flow 


and oxygen perfusion, which may evoke cortical 
activation of the frontal lobe and possibly pro- 
cognitive 
mote 
function.30 



The superior performance in the MoCA and 
WMS-III subtests in the SEQ group may have 
resulted because of the fact that the aerobic exercise 
before cognitive training increases the arousal level 
and consolidates memory, which may benefit sub- 
sequent memory retrieval and cognitive task 
performance.10,11 Our study demonstrates that the 
combination of aerobic exercise and computerized 
cognitive training has synergistic effects that 
improve the cognitive function of stroke patients. 
It may be that the combined training provided a 
more varied and richer sensory and motor experi- 
ence that may promote neural plasticity such as 
synaptogenesis or strengthen synaptic activities.31 
An important difference between our study and 
previous work is that we investigated a variety of 
outcomes related to stroke patient’s ADL, QOL, 


and social participation. Although sequential train- 
ing may result in improvements in general and 
specific cognitive domains, the training effects are 
insufficient transferring to everyday functional 
ADL, QOL, and social participation. In accordance 
with this, a previous systematic review suggested 
that cognitive improvement seems to remain con- 
fined to trained cognitive functions rather than 
generalizing to other daily living skills.32 However, 
another recent work conducted by Oh and Jung 
found that a 4-week cognitive training program is 
beneficial in restoring cognitive function and 
improving ADL in stroke patients.33 Cognitive 
and physical disabilities resulting from a stroke 
can possibly lead to activity limitations and partici- 
pation restrictions.34 Further study is needed to 
investigate the transfer effect of the sequential com- 
bination training on the daily functions and parti- 
cipation aspects of the stroke survivors. 
Our recent study investigated the psychometric 
and clinimetric properties of MoCA in stroke sur- 
vivors, and the minimal clinically important differ- 
ence (MCID) values were estimated to be 1.22 and 
2.15 according to the anchor-based and distribu- 
tion-based methods, respectively.35 Stroke survi- 
vors who achieve 
threshold value may 
the 
demonstrate a clinically important change. In the 
current study, the difference in comparing pre- to 
post-training are as follows: SEQ (from 19.15 to 
24.25, difference = 5.1), AE (from 19.39 to 21.72, 
difference = 2.33), and COG (from 20.28 to 22.57, 
difference = 2.29). Three training groups have 
exceeded MCID based on both anchor-based and 
distribution-based methods, indicating that the 
participants in each training group perceived the 
training protocols as beneficial and meaningful.35 
Some limitations of our study warrant considera- 
tion. First, the SEQ group received a half dose of the 
active ingredient of aerobic exercise and cognitive 
training compared with the COG and AE training 
groups. However, previous research has provided 
little evidence of the individually optimal intensity 
of aerobic exercise or computerized cognitive train- 
ing of the combined program. The findings of this 
study might provide the groundwork for future 
investigations to explore the ideal training para- 
meters. Second, the sample size was relatively small. 
Follow-up studies using a larger sample for the study 
are needed to validate the findings. Additional 
research is needed to investigate patient characteris- 
tics that influence intervention effectiveness. 
Lastly, the training effects were measured immedi- 
ately after the training. Whether the benefits of 
sequential training can be retained over time is 
unknown. The larger the sample population would 
allow, a more generalized interpretation of the results. 

The findings may provide evidence for the potential 
synergistic intervention in cognitive function in 
stroke survivors. Future studies investigating the 
transfer effects and the optimal training parameters 
of the sequential training with a large sample size 
will be beneficial to those stroke survivors with mild 
cognitive impairment.
