Background: Improving the situation in older adults with cognitive decline and evidence of 
cognitive rehabilitation is considered crucial in long-term care of the elderly. The objective of 
this study was to implement a computerized errorless learning-based memory training program 
(CELP) for persons with early Alzheimer’s disease, and to compare the training outcomes of 
a CELP group with those of a therapist-led errorless learning program (TELP) group and a 
waiting-list control group. 
Methods: A randomized controlled trial with a single-blind research design was used in the 
study. Chinese patients with early Alzheimer’s disease screened by the Clinical Dementia Rat- 
ing (score of 1) were recruited. The subjects were randomly assigned to CELP (n = 6), TELP 
(n = 6), and waiting-list control (n = 7) groups. Evaluation of subjects before and after testing, 
and at three-month follow-up was achieved using primary outcomes on the Chinese Mini-Mental 
State Examination, Chinese Dementia Rating Scale, Hong Kong List Learning Test, and the 
Brief Assessment of Prospective Memory-Short Form. Secondary outcomes were the Modified 
Barthel Index, Hong Kong Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, and Geriatric 
Depression Scale-Short Form. The data were analyzed using Friedman’s test for time effect and 
the Kruskal-Wallis test for treatment effect. 
Results: Positive treatment effects on cognition were found in two errorless learning-based 
memory groups (ie, computer-assisted and therapist-led). Remarkable changes were shown in 
cognitive function for subjects receiving CELP and emotional/daily functions in those receiv- 
ing TELP. 
Conclusion: Positive changes in the cognitive function of Chinese patients with early Alzheimer’s 
disease were initially found after errorless training through CELP. Further enhancement of the 
training program is recommended.

Introduction 
The population in Hong Kong is ageing. A local study in Hong Kong showed that the 
prevalence of dementia was 9.3% for those aged 70 years or older.1 The prevalence 
rate of dementia is expected to double for every five years of increase in age.1,2 About 
36 million people worldwide are living with dementia and this figure is expected to 
double every 20 years to 66 million by 2030 and to 115 million by 2050.3 Dementia, 
a progressive impairment of cognitive function, manifests as difficulty with memory,

attention, thinking, and comprehension. The diagnosis of 
dementia is made on evidence of memory deficits plus one 
other cognitive deficit.4–7 One of the memory problems can 
be failure of prospective memory, which is important for 
effective performance of basic activities of daily living (ADL) 
and instrumental ADL in older adults and in individuals with 
mild cognitive impairment.8,9 There are some distinctions 
between time-based and event-based prospective memory.10 
A meta-analysis showed deficits in prospective memory (both 
time-based and event-based) for mild cognitive impairment 
and early dementia, which were correlated with retrospective 
memory and executive functions.11 
Cognitive training studies in healthy older adults and in 
patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia have 
found that those with better cognitive function at baseline have 
better post-treatment training effects.12–15 Epidemiological 
and clinical trials suggest that cognitive exercise might be an 
effective strategy to delay the onset of cognitive impairment in 
older adults.16 A meta-analysis of cognitive training in patients 
with Alzheimer’s disease showed effectiveness for restoration 
of learning, memory, executive functioning, activities of daily 
living, and general cognitive problems.17 
Another evidence-based review showed that errorless 
learning training programs could improve memory function 
in patients with dementia.18 Errorless learning is a technique 
that can compensate for neurocognitive deficits as they relate 
to acquisition of new skills and abilities in rehabilitation.19 
It is a better learning method compared with the trial-and- 
error methods used for teaching individuals with acquired 
memory deficits20 and in teaching everyday tasks for different 
diagnostic groups. A clinical study of prospective memory 
also showed that subjects with mild Alzheimer’s disease 
who received seven weeks of prospective memory training, 
incorporated with errorless training and the spaced retrieval 
technique, showed a post-treatment accuracy of 90% with 
regard to performing prospective memory tasks successfully 
compared with 16%–33% for control subjects.21 Because it 
is important to ensure active participation, some errorless 
learning programs have been integrated with computerized 
rehabilitation.13,22–24 An errorless learning program was pro- 
posed for inclusion in the present study because it would 
bypass errors and strengthen accurate association, given 
that patients with Alzheimer’s disease have difficulty in 
self-correcting errors. The training principles included: the 
learned task being broken into components; overlearning of 
components through repetition and practice; training from 
simple to complex with a hierarchical training of gradation 
and features of early success; positive immediate feedback 
to reinforce learning and a nonthreatening approach with 
hints; and incorporating vanishing cues and spaced retrieval 
strategies.13,19,25 
Computer-assisted cognitive intervention can be very 
effective in dementia.26,27 Computerized cognitive training 
programs (including virtual reality programs) have been 
applied to dementia or suspected dementia and demon- 
strated positive training results on memory function.28,29 
The computer-assisted program was thus hypothesized to be 
more effective than the therapist-led program in this study. 
The advantages and active components of utilizing comput- 
ers included: computers being capable of highly controlled 
presentation of stimuli in a standardized format and able to 
record data more accurately, consistently, and objectively 
than a therapist or observer; the stimuli presented by com- 
puters can be attractive, bright and colorful, which helps to 
engage and focus the patient’s attention; the computer has 
unlimited patience and is very flexible in its programming.30,31 
Further studies comparing computer-assisted and therapist- 
assisted training (the content of training was identical but 
the training package would be delivered by therapists who 
gave instructions face-to-face) suggested that there were 
selective benefits of the former in training outcomes.32–35 
The presence of an “enriched” environment (generated by 
multimedia programming in computerized training) would 
augment the learning outcomes. However, only static and 
passive presentation of teaching materials would be adminis- 
tered in therapist-administered mode, and the materials were 
not comparable with the vivid and colorful screen display 
and audio output generated from the computer. Emotional 
and motivational factors might also play a role in this active 
learning process. 
Therefore, this study had two aims: firstly, to develop and 
implement a computerized errorless learning-based memory 
training program for patients with early Alzheimer’s disease; 
and secondly, to compare the training outcomes of this pro- 
gram with those of a therapist-led errorless learning-based 
program and a waiting-list control group. 
Materials and methods 
Participants 
Chinese psychogeriatric patients with a diagnosis of 
Alzheimer’s disease (International Classification of Dis- 
eases 10th Revision or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition) were screened for in 
psychogeriatric day hospitals, psychogeriatric outpatients at 
Kwai Chung Hospital, and an elderly daycare center in Kwai 
Chung District. Selection criteria included: age $60 years, 






either gender, early dementia (score of 1 on screening with 
the Chinese Dementia Rating Scale),36 otherwise mentally 
stable, capable of following instructions, and an attention 
span of 30–45 minutes. Subjects with severe visual or hearing 
impairment, computer phobia, or impaired physical function- 
ing that precluded the use of a touch-screen computer were 
excluded. 
Procedures 
Ethical approval was secured from the ethics committee of 
the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and clinical research 
ethics committee of the Kowloon West Cluster in the Hong 
Kong Hospital Authority. Written consent was obtained 
from subjects and their caregivers before assessment and 
training. Subjects were then allocated randomly to training 
with a computer-assisted errorless learning program (CELP), 
training with a therapist-led training program (TELP), or a 
waiting-list control group. Outcome evaluation of subjects 
before and after testing and at three-month follow-up was 
performed by independent blinded assessors. Most of the 
subjects completed all the outcome evaluations, including 
follow-up testing. 
The intervention was led by occupational therapists with 
prior specialist training in using errorless memory programs. 
The training programs were implemented on an individual 
basis, approximately twice a week, with a total of 12 30- minute 
training sessions, which were completed in around six weeks. 
The CELP was run using a touch-screen notebook computer 
with a touch-pen input device. Therapists provided guidance 
if the subjects had difficulty using the computer input device 
or had literacy problems. Similarly, the TELP was run on an 
individual basis. A training manual containing colored print 
images was used. Therapists implementing training were 
provided with the same set of instructions and gave similar 
immediate positive feedback to subject participants, as did 
the CELP. The waiting-list control group received general 
cognitively challenging activities to perform, such as card 
sorting and perceptual games, or an errorful memory training 
program of equal duration. 
Instrumentation 
Errorless learning-based memory training programs 
Two memory training programs were developed based on 
cognitive reserve and neuroplasticity theories in dementia, 
suggesting that the brain’s neuroplasticity reserve can be 
enriched through cognitive experience provided by train- 
ing.37,38 The programs also incorporated the technique of 
errorless learning, used together with spaced retrieval and 
vanishing cues12,13,18,22,39–42 in the CELP or TELP. The content 
and structure of both programs were similar, except for the 
mode of delivery. An experienced occupational therapist 
with indepth clinical experience in psychogeriatrics and an 
academic expert in neurocognitive training were responsible 
for the design of the errorless learning memory training 
program. The programs were designed using a culturally 
relevant training program with familiar daily life training 
content, and gradation of training was based on the level of 
functioning, habits, and interests of older Chinese adults with 
early Alzheimer’s disease. The basic training principles were: 
the learned task was broken into components; overlearning 
of components through repetition and practice to enhance 
mastery; training from simple to complex gradation (two 
answers upgraded to three answers); provision of immedi- 
ate positive feedback to reinforce learning; provision of a 
nonthreatening training atmosphere with hints provided; 
and incorporation of vanishing cues and spaced retrieval 
strategies. The rationale for adopting a specific errorless 
learning program is to bypass errors and strengthen accurate 
association, given that patients with Alzheimer’s disease have 
difficulty self-correcting errors. One or two demonstration 
questions and answers were done so that subjects would feel 
able to follow the programs. The level of difficulty of ques- 
tions was set appropriate to the level of cognitive function 
of the subjects. When compared with the training program 
not using errorless learning principles, answers to training 
questions might be too difficult, and without hinting cues sub- 
jects might get a wrong answer easily and become frustrated 
during training. For example, in simple attention training, 
subjects were asked to look at two pictures and confirm if 
they were similar or not. The participants could answer this 
question easily and were also trained to use the computer in a 
competent way during training. Because older Chinese adults 
like Chinese foods such as the Dim Sum, when responding 
to some questions in categorization, subjects had to answer 
if a photograph of a Dim Sum was in the same category or 
not. Scenarios presented during the 12 training sessions were 
similar to tasks in everyday life (Figure 1). 
The program was structured with training components 
including: basic training on various memory types, including 
sensory memory (visual and auditory), working memory, pro- 
spective memory; memory strategies for using mnemonics 
(like chunking, organization, and categorization) and learn- 
ing principles, and also on name/face association; advanced 
memory training on application of strategies to ADL, 
including home-making, habit training, money management, 
shopping, and community-living skills. Immediate positive

feedback was integrated into the training to encourage active 
subject participation (see Table 1). An example of a typical 
training session had three parts: attention, working memory, 
and focus of one training theme on memory (dual task, pro- 
spective memory, name/face recognition/memory strategies, 
habit training, shopping, or community-living tasks, with 
gradation of complexity). 
Screening tool 
The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) was used to 
screen subjects suitable for inclusion in the present study. 
The CDR is a widely used global assessment instrument for 
staging the severity of dementia,36 and takes the form of a 
semistructured interview with the patient and caregiver.43 
A CDR score of 1 indicates that a person has mild dementia. 
Participants with a CDR score of 1 after assessment using the 
Chinese version of the CDR were recruited for this study. 
Primary outcome measures 
Primary outcomes measures used pre-test, post-test, and at 
the three-month follow-up evaluation were as follows. 
Mini-Mental State Examination 
In this study, we used a validated Chinese version of the 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) which assesses 
orientation, memory, visual-spatial copying, and language. 
The MMSE was developed by Folstein et al44 and is a well 
known cognitive screening tool in the elderly.45 Scores range 
from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better cognitive 
function. With reference to the educational background of 
older adults, different cutoff scores are used for dementia: 
a score #22 for those with more than two years of educa- 
tion; a score #20 for those with 1–2 years of education; 
and a score #18 for those with no education. The reported 
sensitivityof the test was 97.5% and the specif icity

was 97.3%. The reported test-retest reliability was 0.78 and 
the inter-rater reliability was 0.99. 
In this study, the HKLLT- Form A with random conditions 
was used. 
Mattis Dementia Rating Scale 
The Chinese version of the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale 
(CDRS)46 was used in this study. The CDRS consists of five 
subscales, ie, attention, initiation/preservation, construction, 
conceptualization, and memory. A total score of 144 with 
a cutoff score of 112 was used to differentiate persons with 
dementia. The cutoff score versus full score for the subscales 
were: 29/37 for attention, 26/37 for initiation/perseverance, 
3/6 for construction, 28/39 for conceptualization, and 18/25 
for memory. More detailed outcome measures could be 
evaluated pretest and post-test depending on the intervention 
used. The sensitivity and specificity of the score was 80.0% 
and 91.6%, respectively. The Cronbach’s α for reliability 
was 0.89. 
Brief Assessment of Prospective Memory-Short 
Form 
The short form of a Chinese assessment of prospective 
memory was used, ie, the Brief Assessment of Prospective 
Memory-Short Form (BAPM)29,48 with 16 questions cover- 
ing aspects on basic self-care and instrumental ADL. Each 
question was scored 1 to 5, where a lower score indicates 
better functioning for elderly subjects. 
Secondary outcome measures 
Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form 
The validated Cantonese version of the Geriatric Depression 
Scale-Short Form (GDS)49 was used in this study.50 A lower 
score indicates better subject mood. A score $8 (of 15) 
indicates the possibility of depression. 
Hong Kong List Learning Test 
The Hong Kong List Learning Test (HKLLT)47 is a Chinese 
verbal learning test, which was developed in Hong Kong and 
consists of two 16-word lists in which all of the words are 
two-character nouns. The words are from four categories and 
are randomly organized. The test consists of three immediate 
recall trials, and two delayed recall trials (10 and 30 minutes). 
Chinese version of the Modified Barthel Index 
The total score on the Chinese version of the Modified 
Barthel Index (MBI)51 is 100 points. This is a self-care 
assessment instrument covers aspects such as grooming, 
feeding, dressing, functional mobility, toileting, bathing, 
and continence. 






Hong Kong Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily 
Living Scale 
The Hong Kong Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily 
LivingScale (HKLIADL)52 evaluates aspects of community- 
 
living skills, such as cooking, use of a telephone, use of 
transport, household management, and shopping. There is a 
total score of 27 points for nine items of community-living 
skills. 
Results 
Forty-nine psychogeriatric patients from Kwai Chung Hospital 
and psychogeriatric outpatient clinics were screened, and 
24 meeting the research criteria were included in this study. 
Five dropped out of the study because of deterioration in their 
medical condition, leaving 19 subjects (six men and 13 women) 
of mean age 77.7 ± 6.07 (68–91) years. Seven subjects were ran- 
domly assigned to CELP, six to TELP, and six to a waiting-list 
control group. Demographic characteristics and baseline mental 
state (MMSE), cognitive function (DRS, HKLLT, BAPM), 
mood (GDS), and functional status (MBI and HKLIADL) were 
similar between the three groups (Table 2). 
Time and treatment effects of the intervention were 
analyzed.Because the study was a repeated-measures design, 
 
and each case was measured three times, it was necessary 
to analyze the time effect with adjustment of the previous 
measurement to prevent time becoming a confounding 
factor. Therefore, analysis of the time effect was done using 
Friedman’s test (a nonparametric form of repeated-measures 
analysis of variance). For analysis of the treatment effect, 
we divided the data into between-group and within-group. 
The change in the treatment period (change between pretest 
score and post-test score) was extracted and used to test the 
difference between the groups to verify our hypothesis. We 
also conducted the within-group analysis pretest and post-test 
to show the effect size of each mode of treatment delivery. 
Friedman’s test was used to analyze within-group repeated 
measures, with adjustment for previous measurements. The 
Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the between-group 
treatment effect, and we used the change of score in the 
treatment period in the computation. The Wilcoxon signed 
rank test was used to examine the within-group treatment 
effect.

For the time effect (the change in score over time) in 
each group, as indicated by Friedman’s test, only the DRS 
(P = 0.04) and MBI (P = 0.02) in the CELP and the DRS 
(P = 0.03) in the TELP showed significant results (Table 3). 
For the DRS score, there was an increase of 4.67 in CELP, 
10.5 in TELP, and only 0.86 in the waiting-list control group 
on pretest and post-test evaluation. 
The treatment effect was defined in this study as the change 
in post-test score from the pretest score. The effect of each 
of the variables was analyzed in the three groups using the 
Kruskal-Wallis test. GDS (P = 0.009) was the only variable 
that showed a statistically significant difference (Table 4). 
Better improvement was observed in the TELP group. 
Moreover, a positive within-group treatment effect was 
found before and after testing. For CELP, there were signifi- 
cant positive changes in MMSE (mean change 2.67, P = 0.04), 
DRS (mean change 4.67, P = 0.03), and BAPM (mean 
change −0.26, P = 0.03), respectively, as well as a marginal 
significantchange in HKLLT (mean change 4.17, P = 0.06). 
 
No significant differences were found in the TELP and control 
groups, except in MBI (mean change 2.5, P = 0.04) and GDS 
(mean change 2, P = 0.03), and a marginally significant change 
in MMSE (mean change 1.33, P = 0.09) in TELP. 
The carry-forward effect was defined as the change in the 
three-month follow-up score from the post-test score, and 
no significant differences were detected between the three 
groups in any of the outcome variables. Deterioration in 
many outcome score items was observed after three months. 
Clearly, it was not easy to maintain improvement in cogni- 
tion, function, and mood three months after completion of 
training (see Table 5). 
Qualitative feedback from participants in this study 
showed that they enjoyed and liked the memory training 
program and that the memory strategies learnt helped them 
in their daily life. They also considered that learning to 
use a computer was not difficult and said that they would

providing more audiovisual feedback from the computer 
program to reinforce the learning of memory strategies. 
Subjects in the CELP group use computers in training, and 
mastery of the computer program was thought to enhance 
their sense of achievement; certainly they took pride in being 
able to show others that they could operate the computer, 
even though they were new users. Subjects were found to 
be highly motivated to attend the full training program as 
scheduled. 
For TELP, more remarkable changes in outcomes were 
found from an emotional and functional point of view, as 
shown by improvements in GDS and MBI. This might be 
due to the fact that TELP was an individualized interactive 
treatment, with a more personalized and patient-centered 
approach. Occupational therapists could be more flexible 
and give immediate support and guidance to subjects when 
they anticipated memory problems from their clinical 
observation. Positive feedback was provided promptly 
and flexibly. This may encourage more active learning in 
patients with Alzheimer’s disease and better self-efficacy 
than errorless learning training alone.54 Some subjects might 
have had literacy problems during some subtheme train- 
ing sessions on delayed recall, so the therapist would give 
support by reading out some simple sentences according 
to the pace of learning in individual subjects. In conduct- 
ing TELP, subjects with early Alzheimer’s disease were 
observed to have difficulty in managing the memory train- 
ing and dual tasks, so needed more guidance and support 
in these training sessions. This might be explained partly 
by attention problems in subjects who had difficulty in 
encoding simultaneous information in the training session. 
Therefore, extra support was often given by the therapist 
helping with the implementation of this errorless learning 
memory program. 
There were pros and cons in using CELP in these patients 
with early Alzheimer’s disease. The computer-assisted pro- 
gram was more standardized, with very interactive visual 
and auditory elements that reinforced errorless learning. 
Graduation of the program could be built in. For example, 
with increasing difficulty of training, delayed recall is likely to 
take longer and require various prompting cues in prospective 
memory training sessions. More regular stimulating positive 
feedback could be integrated into the training program. This 
would save time spent by the therapist and provide quality 
individualized memory training programs for patients with 
dementia. However, some patients with early Alzheimer’s 
disease might need more individual guidance and support to 
complete a structured memory training program. 
This study showed initial positive results for both the 
CELP and TELP programs. More innovative and creative 
cognitive training programs might be developed later for 
healthy older adults or clients with mild cognitive impair- 
ment to enhance brain health and reduce the risk of older 
adults developing dementia. Probably as a result of limita- 
tions in the intensity and duration of the training program 
and the small sample size, some intervention outcomes did 
not achieve statistical significance, eg, scores on MMSE 
in TELP and scores on MBI and GDS in CELP. It is sug- 
gested to increase the number of training sessions from 12 
to 15, with some training sessions lengthened gradually 
from around 30 minutes to 45 minutes when subjects have 
increased their attention span. Errorless learning, repetition, 
an active learning mode with familiar daily life content, 
interactive programs, and computer-based programs are 
considered effective memory training strategies for patients 
with early Alzheimer’s disease.26,54 For further improvement 
of the existing memory training program, three revision 
training sessions could be added at training sessions 5, 10, 
and 15, and some training sessions could be reorganized to 
reinforce further and consolidate memory in patients with 
early Alzheimer’s disease based on the errorless learning and 
spaced retrieval strategies. We did not compare the errorless 
learning program with a non-errorless learning program, 
so it is uncertain if the errorless learning memory strategy 
had a better treatment effect in our patients. This should be 
studied further to confirm the efficacy of CELP in patients 
with dementia. 
Conclusion 
Positive cognitive changes were found initially in Chinese 
patients with early Alzheimer’s disease after attending an 
errorless learning memory training program, either through 
a computer-based mode or a therapist-led mode. An errorless 
learning memory strategy may have a better effect on cogni- 
tive function in these patients. More definitive conclusions 
might be reached in the future when a multicenter, random- 
ized, controlled, larger-sized study has compared errorless 
and non-errorless training programs, using either a computer- 
assisted and/or therapist-administered mode.
