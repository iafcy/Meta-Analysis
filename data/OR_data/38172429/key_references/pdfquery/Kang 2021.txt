Background: Cognitive training can potentially prevent cognitive decline. However, the results of recent studies using 
semi-immersive virtual reality (VR)-assisted cognitive training are inconsistent. 
Objective: We aimed to examine the hypothesis that cognitive training using fully immersive VR, which may facilitate 
visuospatial processes, could improve visuospatial functioning, comprehensive neuropsychological functioning, psychiatric 
symptoms, and functional connectivity in the visual brain network in predementia. 
Methods: Participants over 60 years old with subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment from a memory clinic 
were randomly allocated to the VR (n=23) or the control (n=18) group. The VR group participants received multidomain and 
neuropsychologist-assisted cognitive training in a fully immersive VR environment twice a week for 1 month. The control group 
participants did not undergo any additional intervention except for their usual therapy such as pharmacotherapy. Participants of 
both groups were evaluated for cognitive function using face-to-face comprehensive neuropsychological tests, including the 
Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT) copy task; for psychiatric symptoms such as depression, apathy, affect, and quality 
of life; as well as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) at baseline and after training. Repeated-measures 
analysis of variance was used to compare the effect of cognitive training between groups. Seed-to-voxel–based analyses were 
used to identify the cognitive improvement–related functional connectivity in the visual network of the brain. 
Results: After VR cognitive training, significant improvement was found in the total score (F1,39=14.69, P=.001) and basic 
components score of the RCFT copy task (F1,39=9.27, P=.005) compared with those of the control group. The VR group also 
showed improvements, albeit not significant, in naming ability (F1,39=3.55, P=.07), verbal memory delayed recall (F1,39=3.03, 
P=.09), and phonemic fluency (F1,39=3.08, P=.09). Improvements in psychiatric symptoms such as apathy (F1,39=7.02, P=.01),

affect (F1,39=14.40, P=.001 for positive affect; F1,39=4.23, P=.047 for negative affect), and quality of life (F1,39=4.49, P=.04) were 
found in the VR group compared to the control group. Improvement in the RCFT copy task was associated with a frontal-occipital 
functional connectivity increase revealed by rsfMRI in the VR group compared to the control group. 
Conclusions: Fully immersive VR cognitive training had positive effects on the visuospatial function, apathy, affect, quality 
of life, and increased frontal-occipital functional connectivity in older people in a predementia state. Future trials using VR 
cognitive training with larger sample sizes and more sophisticated designs over a longer duration may reveal greater improvements 
in cognition, psychiatric symptoms, and brain functional connectivity. 





Dementia is a major neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 
[1]. Cognitive, 
approximately 10% of older people 
psychological, and behavioral deterioration are 
typical 
manifestations of dementia, ultimately resulting in functional 
impairments and disability [2]. The individual and societal 
burden of dementia is accelerating rapidly compared to other 
diseases [1,3]; however, due to the unclear mechanisms and 
multifactorial pathology underlying the development and 
progression of dementia, only symptomatic treatments are 
currently available [4]. 
To date, many researchers have suggested that prevention is 
crucial, and have identified risk and protective factors associated 
with dementia, as well as preventive strategies [5]. According 
to a recent large study, one-third of Alzheimer disease (AD) 
cases are attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors such 
as educational attainment, vascular factors, and depression [6]. 
Additionally, lifelong exposure to cognitively and mentally 
engaging activities has been shown to protect against cognitive 
decline [7], and performance of cognitively stimulating activities 
in advanced age was associated with better cognitive function 
[8]. Accordingly, recent cognitive training studies have shown 
that repeated practice of exercises to restore brain and cognitive 
reserves resulted in small to moderate positive improvements 
in cognition in patients with mild to moderate dementia [9]. 

information and 
Advances 
communication technology (ICT) have resulted in increased 
availability and accessibility of computerized cognitive training. 
Although conclusive results have yet to be found, preliminary 
studies have reported improvements in trained and nontrained 
cognition, and enhanced brain activity in related regions after 
computerized cognitive training in individuals with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) [10-12]. Working memory training 
was effective in improving verbal memory and hippocampal 
activation in patients with MCI [11], and exposure to a driving 
video game resulted in increased ability to control the vehicle 
that was related to midline frontal theta power in older people 
[12]. Moreover, emerging ICT applications using virtual reality 
(VR) have resulted in evolutions in health care, including 
cognitive and behavioral 
therapy [13]. VR can offer 
interventions in flexible and real world–like environments,

transference outcomes [14], highlighting a role for cognitive 
training in a virtual environment in basic research and clinical 
practice. Owing to the lack of knowledge and dearth of 
experiments on VR-based cognitive training, especially the fully 
immersive type [15,16], further studies are needed to ascertain 
its potential therapeutic efficacy. 

Recently, the number of neuroimaging studies attempting to 
reveal the underlying neural mechanisms associated with 
cognitive decline has increased [17,18]. Functional connectivity 
studies using resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
temporally 
imaging (rsfMRI) have 
coinciding with spatially distant neurophysiological events that 
are intrinsically coherent during a resting state such as the 
default-mode network [19]. We considered that functional 
connectivity studies using rsfMRI may be able to reveal the 
neural mechanism, especially in the visual network, responsible 
for the observed cognitive improvements following VR 
cognitive training, as such training is based on the cognitive 
reserve hypothesis associated with functional neural networks 
[20]. 
To test this hypothesis, we performed a preliminary randomized 
controlled trial to determine the efficacy and mechanisms of 
VR cognitive training in a predementia state. We aimed to 
ascertain the effects of VR multidomain cognitive training on 
visuospatial function, comprehensive neuropsychological 
function, and psychiatric symptoms in predementia. Moreover, 
we examined the hypothesis that cognitive improvement could 
be related to increased functional connectivity in the visual 
network of the brain. 

Participants 
Participants over 60 years old in a predementia state (ranging 
from subjective cognitive decline to MCI) were prospectively 
recruited between May and December 2019 from the memory 
clinic of Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Republic of 
Korea. Among 58 individuals who were assessed for eligibility 
using structured clinical interviews and brain MRI, four 
participants were excluded due to cerebral infarction on MRI 
(n=2), severe white matter hyperintensity on MRI (n=1), and 
history of a recent dental implant surgery (n=1). Nine 
participants voluntarily withdrew from the study due to an acute

(page number not for citation purposes) 


medical condition (n=2), hospitalization of a family member 
(n=1), scheduling conflict (n=1), and unknown personal reasons 
(n=5). Finally, a total of 45 participants were randomly assigned 
to either the VR group or the control group. 
All participants had subjective cognitive complaints, including 
memory decline, but did not meet the criteria for diagnosis of 
a major neurocognitive disorder based on the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition) [2]. 
Participants were classified as having subjective cognitive 
decline according to the corresponding research criteria and 
five cognitive domain scores such as attention, language, 
visuospatial, memory, and frontal executive functions above 
–1.5 SD [21,22]. Participants were classified as having MCI 
according to the Petersen criteria [23]. Screening evaluation of 
the participants was performed by a board-certified psychiatrist 
(JK) and a clinical neuropsychologist (SL). 


The exclusion criteria for the participants were as follows: (i) 
Korean version of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 
score <20; (ii) impaired activities of daily living; (iii) 
comorbidity of severe medical or surgical conditions; (iv) major 
psychiatric disorders; (v) history of any kind of dementia; (vi) 
history 
including 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Pick disease, Huntington disease, 
Parkinson disease, inflammation associated with HIV, and 
syphilis; (vii) structural abnormalities on MRI such as 
intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral, cerebellar, or brainstem 
infarction, hydrocephalus, traumatic brain injury, severe white 
matter hyperintensity, tumors, multiple sclerosis, or vasculitis; 
and (viii) inability to use the VR system. 

Information on study objectives, group allocation, cognitive 
intervention, brief study protocol, risks and benefits, and 
confidentiality was given to all participants before enrollment. 
All participants provided offline written informed consent, and 
the Institutional Review Board of Gachon University Gil 
Medical Center approved this study (GCIRB2018-396). 

Study Design 
trial 
This was an open-label, 
(KCT0005243) that aimed to investigate the efficacy of a fully 
immersive VR cognitive training program on visuospatial 
function in older people with risk for dementia (Multimedia 
Appendix 1). Participants were randomly assigned to either the 
VR or the control group. The unblinded randomization was 
performed by drawing lots with the participants present. 
Participants in both groups were evaluated for visuospatial 
function, comprehensive neuropsychological function, and 
psychiatric symptoms, and underwent rsfMRI before and after 
the 1-month cognitive training. The participants in the VR group 
underwent VR cognitive training twice a week for a total of 
eight sessions in addition to their usual therapy such as 
pharmacotherapy for the prevention of dementia (eg, choline 
alfoscerate and cholinesterase inhibitor); the participants in the 
control group did not undergo any additional intervention except 
for their usual therapy such as pharmacotherapy. 
VR Cognitive Training 
The multidomain VR cognitive training program was developed 
between November 2018 and April 2019 by the authors who 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
are board-certified geriatric neuropsychiatrists and clinical 
neuropsychologists with expertise. The VR cognitive training 
program consisted of multiple games involving multidomain 
cognitive tasks to assess: (i) attention (to find differences), (ii) 
executive function and memory (to select items needed to 
perform certain tasks), (iii) working memory and ability to 
perform mathematical calculations (to prepare an exact amount 
of money), (iv) visuospatial orientation (to find a path using a 
memorized map), (v) visuospatial function (to spatially place 
furniture exactly based on a memorized drawing), (vi) verbal 
memory (to remember certain words), (vii) visual memory (to 
remember specific flags and symbols), and (viii) processing 
speed and working memory (to catch animals in a certain order). 
All virtual environments were fully immersive 3D settings 
allowing for feelings of increased presence and visuospatial 
stimulation; training was accompanied by game elements to 
increase the interest and motivation of the participants. 
Representative images of the VR training program are presented 
in Multimedia Appendix 2. 
Each session lasted approximately 20-30 minutes. The VR 
training took place using a head-mounted Oculus Rift CV1 
display, with Oculus Touch controllers held in both of the 
participant’s hands. Each training session was performed with 
the participant in a seated position, and the difficulty level 
increased throughout the study period from easy to difficult 
(levels 1-4), with two sessions at each difficulty level. All 
procedures were performed in the memory clinic of Gachon 
University Gil Medical Center and were guided by a certified 
clinical neuropsychologist (SL) in addition to automatic verbal 
and visual messages from the program. There were no revisions, 
updates, or breaches of the program during the study period. 
This program was used exclusively in this study and is not 
available for commercial use. 
Procedures and Outcome Measures 
All participants underwent 
face-to-face comprehensive 
neuropsychological tests and evaluations using psychiatric 
scales, as well as rsfMRI at baseline and after the VR cognitive 
training period. Baseline evaluations of diagnostic criteria 
included global and functional scales such as the Korean version 
of the MMSE, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), CDR Sum of 
Boxes (CDR-SOB), global deterioration scale, and instrumental 
activities of daily living scales. 
The primary outcome was the effect of the VR cognitive training 
on visuospatial function measured by the Rey-Osterrieth 
Complex Figure Test (RCFT) copy task, which has been 
validated in the Korean population [24,25]. Basic components, 
including a large rectangle (1 point), diagonal cross (1 point), 
horizontal midline of a large rectangle (1 point), and vertical 
midline of a large rectangle (1 point), were also evaluated 
because they are considered important in qualitative aspects 
[26,27]. The neuropsychologist (GP) who scored the RCFT 
copy task was blinded to the randomization. 
The secondary outcomes concerned the effect on comprehensive 
neuropsychological function; psychiatric symptoms such as 
affect, apathy, quality of life (QoL), and depression; and 
functional connectivity in the visual network of the brain.

(page number not for citation purposes) 


The neuropsychological tests consisted of the MMSE and 
subtests from the comprehensive neuropsychological test battery 
[25]. Attention was assessed by the digit span forward and 
backward test and Trail Making Test (TMT) part A [25]. The 
Korean version of the Boston Naming Test (K-BNT) was used 
to assess language ability [25,28]. Memory was assessed by 
measuring performance on three tasks of the Seoul Verbal 
Learning Test (SVLT): immediate recall, delayed recall after 
20 minutes, and recognition [25]. Frontal executive function 
was assessed by phonemic word fluency testing, the TMT-B, 
and the Stroop Color Test [25]. All neuropsychological test 
results were adjusted for age and years of education, and are 
presented as standardized z-scores. 
Noncognitive psychiatric symptoms that typically start to decline 
in the early dementia stage were also assessed [29]. Depressive 
symptoms were evaluated by the validated 30-item Geriatric 
Depression Scale (GDS), including questions pertaining to 
mood, anxiety, energy, satisfaction, hopefulness, inattention, 
and sleep quality [30,31]. The GDS comprises a series of binary 
yes/no questions (scored as 1 or 0, respectively), with higher 
scores indicating severe depression. Apathy was evaluated by 
the validated 18-item Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), including 
items pertaining to emotional affect, behavior, and cognitive 
apathy [32,33]. Items of the AES are rated on a 4-point Likert 
scale, with a low score indicating severe apathy. Affect was 
evaluated by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule 
(PANAS), which consists of 10 items to assess positive affect 
(PANAS-P) measures such as alertness and enthusiasm and 10 
items to assess negative affect (PANAS-N) such as lethargy 
and feelings of sadness [34,35]. Each of the PANAS items is 
rated from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much), with higher scores 
indicating higher affect. Participants’ QoL was evaluated by 
the QoL-AD scale, which has been validated for use in people 
with dementia, including 13 subjective rating items to assess 
physical health, living situation, relationships with friends, and 
the ability to engage in leisure activities [36,37]. Items of the 
QoL-AD are assessed on a 4-point Likert scale, with higher 
scores indicating better QoL. 
The Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) was administered 
after each session to evaluate tolerability of the VR cognitive 
training program [38]. Simulator sickness refers to side effects 
from virtual environment usage, and is also called cybersickness 
[39,40] and VR sickness [41]. The SSQ consists of 16 items 
yielding three subscales (nausea, oculomotor, and disorientation) 
and a total severity score, with high scores indicating increased 
symptoms. The levels of interest and satisfaction were also 
assessed on a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 100 after the period 
of VR cognitive training in a face-to-face manner. 
MRI Acquisition 
A 3-Tesla whole-body Siemens scanner (TrioTim syngo) was 
used for functional image acquisition with an interleaved 
T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging gradient echo sequence 
(repetition time/echo time=2500/25 milliseconds, flip angle=90°, 
slice thickness=3.5 mm, in-plane resolution=3.5×3.5 mm, matrix 
size=64×64) with a 12-channel birdcage head coil. For each 
participant, 160 functional volumes were acquired at the 
pretraining and posttraining time points. After rsfMRI, an 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
anatomical image was acquired using a high T1-weighted 
3D-gradient echo pulse sequence with magnetization-prepared 
rapid gradient echo (repetition time/echo time/inversion 
time=1900/3.3/900 milliseconds, 
slice 
thickness=1.0 mm, in-plane resolution=0.5×0.5 mm, matrix 
size=416×512). T1-weighted images were acquired only at the 
pretraining time point. 


Functional Connectivity Analyses With rsfMRI 
Preprocessing of the rsfMRI data was performed using Statistical 
Parametric Mapping software version 12 (Wellcome Trust 
Centre for Neuroimaging). First, a slice-timing correction was 
applied and the center of each image was relocated near the 
anterior commissure. Second, rsfMRI and T1-weighted images 
were imported into CONN FC toolbox v19c [42] for further 
preprocessing. To correct for between-scan rigid body motion, 
the functional images were realigned to the first image in the 
time series. The functional images were coregistered with 
anatomical images and spatially normalized to the Montreal 
Neurological Institute space using a transformation matrix 
derived from the T1-weighted anatomical image segmentation. 
The functional images were then resliced to 2×2×2 mm and 
spatially smoothed using an 8-mm full width at half maximum 
Gaussian kernel. 
All preprocessed rsfMRI images were bandpass-filtered 
(0.008-0.09 Hz), and physiological and other spurious noise 
sources in the blood oxygenation level–dependent signal were 
removed using the anatomical component-based noise correction 
strategy implemented in CONN [43]. Outliers were calculated 
using the Artifact Detection Tools toolbox [44], and six motion 
correction parameters obtained from realignment were also 
modeled as nuisance covariates. The seed-to-voxel analyses 
were performed in the visual network with four cortical seed 
regions (right visual lateral, left visual lateral, visual medial, 
and visual occipital cortices) with predefined regions of interest 
based on the Harvard-Oxford atlas (fMRIB Software Library) 
[45]. Seed-based analyses were adjusted for age, years of 
education, sex, CDR-SOB, depressive symptoms, and 
pharmacotherapy. The mean time series for each seed region 
was calculated and then correlated with the time courses of all 
other voxels in the brain for each participant. 
Sample Calculation and Statistical Analyses 
Sample calculation was based on a recent meta-analysis on the 
effectiveness of VR for people with MCI or dementia that 
produced small-to-medium effect sizes using a random-effects 
model (effect size=0.29) from a total of 11 studies [15]. 
Assuming an attrition rate of 20%, a total sample size of 32 
patients (16 per treatment group) would provide 0.8 power at 
a two-sided α error of .05. Power analysis was performed with 
G*Power software version 3.1.9.2. 
Comparisons of demographic and clinical variables between 
the two groups were performed using independent t tests, the 
Mann-Whitney U test, or the χ2 test. The paired t test was used 
in within-group comparisons of pretraining and posttraining 
measures. Repeated-measures analyses of variance was used to 
find the group interaction of the VR cognitive training on 
neuropsychological function and psychiatric symptom scales 
J Med Internet Res 2021 | vol. 23 | iss. 5 | e24526 | p. 4 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


after adjusting for age, years of education, sex, CDR-SOB, 
depressive symptoms, and pharmacotherapy. Age and years of 
education were not adjusted in analyses with comprehensive 
neuropsychological test results that are presented as age- and 
years of education–adjusted z-scores. All statistical analyses 
were performed with SPSS software version 23 (SPSS Inc), 
with a significance level assessed at P<.05 (two-tailed). 
For rsfMRI data, Pearson correlation coefficients were converted 
the Fisher r-to-z 
to normally distributed scores using 
transformation. Group-level comparisons between the VR and 
control groups were performed using a general linear model in 
which improved cognitive task score was used as an explanatory 
variable and the posttraining minus pretraining z-transformation 
value was used as a dependent variable after adjusting for age, 
sex, years of education, CDR-SOB, depressive symptoms, and 
pharmacotherapy. The statistical thresholds for significance 
were set at voxel-wise uncorrected P<.001 and cluster-wise 
corrected P<.05 to correct for false-positive rates. 

Participants 
Of the 45 participants who were randomly allocated to the VR 
(n=25) or the control (n=20) group, 41 participants completed 
the study. After allocation, two participants of the VR group 
dropped out of the study due to dizziness (n=1) and unfamiliarity 
with the VR machine during the first session (n=1). Two 
participants of the control group dropped out because of 
hospitalization due to a traffic accident (n=1) and unknown 
personal reasons (n=1). Ultimately, 41 participants were 
included in the analyses. The trial flow chart is presented in 
Figure 1. 

Demographic and Clinical Characteristics 
Table 1 presents the detailed demographic and clinical 
characteristics of the study participants. Among the 41 
participants, 23 (56%) and 18 (44%) were assigned to the VR 
and control groups, respectively. Participant age was around 75 
years, and they were predominantly women. No group 
differences were found in the baseline diagnostic evaluation.

Increased Functional Connectivity in rsfMRI 
We investigated brain functional connectivity in the visual 
network associated with the improvement in the RCFT copy 
task. The areas with significantly increased connectivity in the 
seed-to-voxel visual networks are presented in Table 6: (a) from 
the right visual lateral cortices to the left paracingulate gyrus, 
right paracingulate gyrus, left frontal pole, left superior frontal 
gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, and white matter; and (b) from 
the visual medial cortices to the right insular cortex, right frontal 
pole, right frontal operculum cortex, right caudate, left caudate, 
right putamen, left insular cortex, and white matter. 
Figure 2 depicts the increased regional functional connectivity 
in the brain cortices and the white matter that are related to 
improvements in the RCFT copy task in the VR group compared 
to the control group.

Principal Findings 
This study found that 1-month multidomain cognitive training 
using fully immersive VR was effective in improving 
visuospatial 
functional 
connectivity, as well as apathy, affect, and QoL in older people 
in a predementia cognitive state. 



The first major finding of this study is that VR cognitive training 
resulted in improvements in the RCFT copy task. Despite the 
inconsistent results reported in the literature, training-related 
changes in cognition have been repeatedly found in older people 
with cognitive disorders [9,10]. Neuropsychological test score 
improvements after traditional pen-and-paper or computerized 
cognitive training have been found in measures of global 
composite cognition [46-48], verbal memory [11,46,49,50], 
verbal letter fluency [46,47], verbal fluency [51,52], and 
visuospatial function in the clock-drawing test [46,53]. It has 
also been reported that VR cognitive training was effective in 
improving frontal executive function in individuals with MCI 
[54], as well as attention and visual memory in older people 
[55,56]. In line with these previous studies, our results also

showed that multidomain cognitive training in a virtual 
environment was effective in visuospatial function measured 
by the RCFT copy task in total and basic components 
comprising the gestalt of the feature showing the ability to 
approach [26,27]. Although not significant, improvements in 
naming ability, verbal memory delayed recall, and frontal 
executive function were also found in the training group 
compared to the control group. It is possible that the relatively 
short 1-month training period might have resulted in the lack 
of group difference, as a learning effect may have impacted the 
posttraining neuropsychological test results in the control group. 
However, the improvement in visuospatial function in the VR 
group, even after the short period of cognitive training, might 
be attributed to the ecological nature of the fully immersive VR 
environment. In the enriched auditorily and visually stimulating 
environment, processing of visual orientation, visuospatial 
construction, and visual selective attention likely occurred 
[57,58]. In recent studies with VR evaluation, investigators have 
been able to effectively differentiate between the navigational 
[59] and visuospatial deficits observed in patients with MCI 
and healthy older people [60,61]. In studies with VR 
interventions, VR cognitive training was found to be effective 
[55,62] or ineffective [56,63] in improving visuospatial function

(page number not for citation purposes) 


in older people or those in an early dementia stage. We believe 
that the cognitive training performed in the maximally 
immersive environment with the head-mounted display, 
headphones, and hand movement trackers in our study might 
have increased visuospatial functioning in those at a predementia 
stage [64]. The immersion methods utilized in previous studies 
investigating VR cognitive training in older people have 
employed desktop-based systems [55,56], screen and sensors 
[62], screen and glasses [65,66], and head-mounted display and 
fixed joystick setups [63]. Although heterogeneity in study 
populations and methodological differences among prior studies 
have resulted in inconsistent findings, this study provides further 
evidence to support the benefits of VR cognitive training in 
eliciting improvements in visuospatial processing through the 
repeated presentation of real-world, dynamic, multisensory, and 
interactive environments. 
Another novel finding was the increased functional connectivity 
observed in the frontal-occipital cortical network after VR 
cognitive training, which was associated with improved 
performance in the RCFT copy task, consistent with the 
associations between cognitive improvements and neuronal 
plasticity that have been observed previously [67]. In patients 
with MCI, significant associations have been observed between 
verbal memory improvement and left hippocampal activation 
in task-related fMRI after 8-week training to improve auditory 
processing speed and accuracy [11]. Other studies have shown 
that 6 weeks of episodic memory training in patients with MCI 
resulted in the manifestation of new associations between 
improved delayed word recall test performance and brain 
activation in the right inferior parietal lobule in fMRI during 
memory encoding [68]. In healthy older people, 8 weeks of 
exposure to a cognitive control training program led to an 
increased frontoparietal network related to cognitive control 
ability [69]; another study found that verbal recall was associated 
with an increased left hippocampal volume in healthy older 
people after 8 weekly verbal recall memory training sessions 
[70]. Thus, in this study, repetitive cognitive training in a novel 
fully immersive environment might have increased the 
frontal-occipital activation in accordance with improved 
visuospatial function. We also observed increased functional 
connectivity in white matter areas, which are known to exhibit 
a lower hemodynamic response than the grey matter. Although 
fMRI studies have focused on grey matter until recently, the 
increased functional connectivity in the white matter close to 
the grey matter supports the growing neural evidence of fMRI 
white matter changes induced by VR cognitive training [71,72]. 
This evident link between visuospatial construction and 
frontal-occipital functional connectivity might be explained by 
the acquired cognitive system engagement induced by the RCFT 
copy task, which requires the participant to copy a complex 
geometric figure [73]. Visuoconstructive ability is based on the 
Van Sommers model of drawing [74]; according to this cognitive 
model, the RCFT copy task consists of (i) visual recognition of 
a 2D Rey-Osterrieth complex figure; (ii) visual representation 
of the figure in long-term or temporary memory; (iii) graphical 
output processes such as those related to depiction decisions 
(eg, context, orientation, viewpoint, details, and boundary) or 
reproduction strategies (eg, copying orders, dimensions, shapes, 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
diagonals, crosses, line sets); (iv) graphical planning (eg, routine 
or contingent planning); and (v) articulation and economic 
constraints during motor output. Through these steps, multiple 
brain regions have been found to be associated with performance 
in the RCFT copy task, including the temporal, parietal, 
occipital, and frontal cortices in both hemispheres or in the right 
hemisphere alone [75-77]. Although we observed increased 
activity only in the primary visual cortices (visual medial) and 
the right associative visual cortices (right visual lateral) 
connecting to the areas in the middle frontal cortices, these 
regions are known to be involved in the visual recognition and 
graphic output planning processes required to complete the 
RCFT copy task [74], and are associated with visuo-motor 
transformation and multistep object use in the task [77]. A recent 
study reported that lesions in the right superior parietal lobe and 
the middle occipital gyrus were associated with poor RCFT 
copy task performance [78], which is in accordance with our 
results. Furthermore, there have been reports on improvements 
in nontrained cognitive functions, also known as transfer effects, 
in memory training in older people with MCI [79,80]. Previous 
studies have shown that repeated memory-focused training 
might have enhanced the processing speed of memory retrieval 
and the efficiency of working memory, assuming that frontal 
executive function was the main recipient of the transfer effects 
[79,80]. Although recent studies have applied cognitive training 
with novel computerized tools and involvement of multiple 
cognitive domains, existing programs have only applied 
cognitive training in a 2D environment with an emphasis on 
language abilities [9,53,79,81]. Since frontal executive function 
plays a major role in all cognitive domains and higher-order 
cognitive controls [82], the improved performance on the RCFT 
copy task may be supported by increased functional connectivity 
in the frontal-occipital network. 
The psychiatric benefit of VR cognitive training in individuals 
in a predementia state should be considered. In this study, 
participants in the VR group showed improved apathy, affect, 
and QoL scores after training compared with those in the control 
group. A recent review reported that computerized cognitive 
training resulted in long-term improvements in psychological 
outcome measures [16]. Although methodologies vary across 
studies, 3D VR cognitive training was effective in improving 
depressive symptoms in patients with MCI compared with an 
active control group receiving music therapy [63]. Moreover, 
a few feasibility studies have reported improved alertness, 
pleasure, apathy, and security following one-time exposure to 
a less immersive VR environment [65,66]. We postulate that 
apathy, affect, and QoL might be improved by the VR cognitive 
training, as these are some of the early symptoms of dementia 
[83]. Immersive virtual environments might facilitate the limited 
functioning of patients with cognitive disorders that affect 
communication, interaction, motivation, engagement, and 
positive attitudes toward others [84]. Thus, the importance of 
virtual environments should be considered in cognitive training 
because the feeling of presence itself in a 3D space can enhance 
volitional motivation, allowing one to constantly process 
external stimuli and cognitively adjust to changing environments 
[85].

Simulator sickness reported after every session was minimal in 
the VR cognitive training group. In this study, the SSQ total 
score (mean 12.86, SD 11.82) indicated minimal symptoms 
(score 5-10) according to the suggested categorization 
established in flight simulators [86]. Although the SSQ was 
originally developed and validated in military personnel using 
flight simulators, it is the most commonly used measure of 
sickness in a virtual environment [40]. A recent meta-analysis 
of the SSQ in virtual environments reported total and subscale 
scores and dropout rates according to VR conditions (total 28.00, 
SD 1.71; nausea 16.72, SD 0.77; oculomotor 17.09, SD 0.55; 
disorientation 23.50, SD 1.17; dropout rate 15.6%) [87]. 
Compared to the results in a VR environment, our results on 
the SSQ scores and dropout rates (8%) showed better 
tolerability, with moderate interest and satisfaction. The SSQ 
scores have been reported to be higher in VR than in a flight 
simulator environment [86] and with gaming content than 
without it [87]. Despite the characteristics of VR in this study, 
such as fully immerse, game and training components, and old 
users at an early stage of cognitive decline, these results may 
imply that fully immersive VR can be a safe and interesting 
method for cognitive training. 
Limitations 
Our study had several strengths and limitations. This is one of 
the largest VR cognitive training studies to use a fully immersive 
3D VR program. Compared to 2D or semi-immersive VR 
programs, our results highlight the positive effects of employing 
fully immersive 3D VR in cognitive training, as we found neural 
evidence supporting the improvement in visuospatial function. 
However, there are several limitations and lessons learned in 
this study. First, the small sample size and short training period 
were the main limitations. Although sample sizes in studies 
investigating the effects of cognitive training are increasing 
[88], most VR trials still rely on small sample sizes and are 
performed over a short duration, especially those using fully 
virtual environments [15]. Short clinical trial periods in previous 
studies investigating the effect of computerized cognitive 
training programs have also been a limiting factor in the field 
as a whole [88]. Thus, future studies should aim to increase the 
sample sizes and extend the duration of training to better 
evaluate the effect of VR cognitive training. Second, we 
considered that the per-protocol analysis could bias the results 
of this randomized controlled trial, although the number of 
participants who dropped out of the study was the same in both 
groups. Third, the lack of an active control group in this study 
is another limitation. Some previous trials have included active 
control groups receiving psychoeducation, cognitive therapy, 
face-to-face music therapy, or pen-and-paper cognitive training 
for comparisons with the VR training group [15,63]. In the 
future, various active control groups should be considered to 
confirm the effectiveness of VR cognitive training. Fourth, the 
lack of examination for AD biomarkers such as cerebrospinal 
fluid analysis or brain imaging for amyloid detection can be a 
limitation because it is unclear whether the participants in our 
study will develop AD, which is the most prevalent cause of 
dementia. Future studies involving AD biomarkers could clearly 
explain the pure effect of cognitive training in individuals in a 
preclinical or prodromal dementia state. Lastly, heterogeneity 
among patients, practitioners, program content, and accessibility 
to the VR system can limit the generalizability of the results to 
other populations. 
Conclusions 
We found that fully immersive VR cognitive training improved 
cognition and psychiatric symptoms in a predementia state. 
Visuospatial function improved in such individuals relative to 
controls, and this finding was supported by increased 
frontal-occipital functional connectivity assessed by rsfMRI. 
These findings suggest that VR training can enhance visuospatial 
ability by exposing patients to an enriched virtual environment, 
leading to improved apathy, affect, and QoL. Our results support 
the neurotherapeutic use of VR cognitive training as an effective 
nonpharmacological intervention for those who are at risk for 
dementia; however, more rigorous trials should be performed 
to confirm the effects and identify the associated neural 
mechanisms.
