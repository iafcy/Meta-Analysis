Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) often appears in the pre- 
cursor period between normal ageing and dementia and is 
thus 
step towards dementia 
first 
(Dardiotis et al., 2019; Greenaway, Duncan, & Smith, 2013; 
Jelcic et al., 2012; Manouilidou, Dolenc, Marvin, & Pirtosek, 
2016; Stamati et al., 2019). Epidemiological studies have 
shown that 8–15% of individuals with MCI will progress to 
dementia every year, and up to 80% will progress to demen- 
tia within six years. A group of MCI patients with memory 
impairment is the typical prodromal stage of dementia and 
carries a high conversion risk to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
(Petersen et al., 2013). Indeed, the majority of patients with 
MCI develop AD, although some do stay stable and a few of 
them even get better (Schaefer, Dibble, & Duff, 2015). 
Prior research has revealed that patients with MCI face 
problems with memory (Ganguli, Dodge, Shen, & DeKosky, 
2004; Olchik, Farina, Steibel, Teixeira, & Yassuda, 2013; 
Savulich et al., 2017; Tsapanou et al., 2017), attention 
(Herrera, Chambon, Michel, Paban, & Alescio-Lautier, 2012) 
executive function (Barekatain, Alavirad, Tavakoli, Emsaki, 
& Maracy, 2016; Huckans et al., 2013), verbal fluency (Taler, 
Klepousniotou, & Phillips, 2009) and lexical decision tasks 
(Taler & Jarema, 2004). Moreover, they have been found to 
present less sensitivity to semantic violations when com- 
pared to healthy controls (semantic priming) (Davie et al., 
2004) and to face difficulties categorizing the words based 
on their meaning (Olchik et al., 2013) or rhyme (Dwolatzky 
et al., 2003). 

To date, no approved pharmacological treatment for cog- 
nitive decline in MCI has been made available (Vlachos 
et al., 2019). Consequently, research has focused on finding 
(Cooper, Li, 
effective, non-pharmacological 
Lyketsos, & Livingston, 2013). Computer-based cognitive 
training seems to be beneficial for individuals with MCI 
since it can slow down their cognitive decline, or even, in 
some cases, optimize their cognitive functioning (Mueller, 
2016; Tsolaki et al., 2017). Several studies using computer- 
based cognitive training interventions have reported that, at 
the end of the intervention, the training group performed 
better on working memory (Oskoei, Nejati, & Fathabadi, 
2013), delayed memory (Herrera et al., 2012; Olchik et al., 
2013), executive function (Greenaway et al., 2013; Herrera 
et al., 2012), episodic recall and recognition (Herrera et al.,

ABSTRACT 
The purpose of the present study was to explore the effects of computer-based multidomain cog- 
nitive training program on Greek patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Forty-six patients 
with MCI were randomly divided into two groups; (a) the training group, which received a com- 
puter-based multidomain cognitive training program with the use of the RehaCom software and 
(b) the control group, which underwent standard-clinical care. The duration of the computer-based 
training program was 15 weeks, administered twice a week for approximately one hour per ses- 
sion. Analysis of the baseline versus endpoint performance of each group demonstrated that in 
the control group delayed memory and executive function had deteriorated over the observation 
period of 15 weeks, while improvement was observed in the training group’s performance on 
delayed memory, word recognition, Boston Naming Test 
(CDT), 
Semantic Fluency (SF), Trail Making Test-A (TMT-A) and Trail Making Test-B (TMT-B). Comparison 
between the two groups presented asignificant effect of the intervention for most cognitive 
domains. These findings are promising for the development of training methods designed to 
delay cognitive decline in patients with MCI, which is considered to be the prodromal stage of 
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). 



2012), semantic fluency (Olchik et al., 2013; Rojas et al., 
2013; Rozzini et al., 2007; Talassi et al., 2007) and naming 
(Rojas et al., 2013) when compared to passive or control 
groups with MCI. 
Some computer-based cognitive training programs have 
mainly focused on specific areas, such as memory and attention 
(Han et al., 2014; Herrera et al., 2012; Hyer et al., 2016; Man, 
Chung, & Lee, 2012; Mansbach, Mace, & Clark, 2017; Savulich 
et al., 2017; Styliadis, Kartsidis, Paraskevopoulos, Ioannides, & 
Bamidis, 2015), since these domains are considered to be the 
first to be affected in the progression of the impairment. On the 
other hand, other studies have pointed out the advantages of a 
multidomain computer-based cognitive training, instead of a 
domain-focused approach (Bahar-Fuchs et al., 2017; Barban 
et al., 2016; Delbroek, Vermeylen, & Spildooren, 2017; 
Fiatarone Singh et al., 2014; Gooding et al., 2016). Ge, Zhu, Wu, 
and McConnell (2018), in their recent review, observed that in 
studies in which interventions were focused on a specific cogni- 
tive domain, patients’ performance improved in this specific 
domain (e.g., memory or attention) only, whereas in studies 
where multiple cognitive domain intervention programs were 
used, participants’ performance improved in most of the cogni- 
tive domains (Bahar-Fuchs et al., 2017; Delbroek et al., 2017; 
Ge et al., 2018; Gooding et al., 2016). This general improvement 
of their cognitive ability is reported to have positively affected 
their daily life as well and mood (Bahar-Fuchs, Clare, & Woods, 
2013; Gooding et al., 2016; Savulich et al., 2017). 
In the present study, forty-six Greek patients with MCI 
were carefully chosen based on the criteria proposed by 
Petersen et al. (2013). Almost half of them (25 patients) 
received a 15-week, computer-based multidomain cognitive 
training with the use of the RehaCom software. RehaCom 
trains several cognitive domains, such as memory, attention, 
logical thinking, visuo-motor disturbances, executive func- 
tion and processing speed. 
Although many studies have reported the benefits of 
RehaCom in Parkinson’s disease (Diez-Cirarda et al., 2017; 
Pena et al., 2014), mild AD (Nousia et al., 2018), multiple 
sclerosis (Dardiotis et al., 2017; Nasios, Messinis, Kosmidis, 
& Papathanasopoulos, 2018; Rilo et al., 2018), brain injuries 
(Fernandez et al., 2012; Pantzartzidou et al., 2017) and 
schizophrenia (d’Amato et al., 2011; Guerrero Pertinez & 
Garcia Linares, 2015; Mak et al., 2013), its effect on MCI 
has not been explored before. Moreover, RehaCom is a rela- 
tively new intervention program for Greek researchers and 
clinicians 
Messinis, 
et 
Papathanasopoulos, Kosmidis, Nasios, & Kambanaros, 2018; 
Nasios et al., 2018; Nousia et al., 2018; Pantzartzidou et al., 
2017; Yoo, Yong, Chung, & Yang, 2015). In particular, 
Nousia et al. (2018), who explored the effect of RehaCom in 
mild AD, a disease more closely related to MCI compared 
to the other studies, reported its significantly beneficial effect 
on attention, processing speed, naming, semantic fluency, 
delayed memory, visuospatial ability and executive function. 
As expected, the general cognitive improvement was con- 
nected to patients’ higher quality of life. 



Therefore, based on the outcomes of the aforementioned 
studies, in which RehaCom was used, the training group of 

(a) an

cognitive 
domains, compared to its performance before the interven- 
tion and (b) better performance in most of 
the trained 
domains compared to the controls. 



In the time period from January to June 2018, a total of 87 
patients with MCI, native speakers of the Greek language, 
attending the Clinical Laboratory of Speech and Language 
Therapy of the University of Ioannina, were screened for 
suitability of participation in the study. Forty-one patients, 
however, were excluded for specific reasons (Figure 1) and 
consequently, 46 MCI patients were enrolled in the study, 
none of whom dropped out during the training period. 
These patients were randomly divided into two groups; (a) 
the training group which underwent multidomain cognitive 
training intervention with the RehaCom software (Training 
Group, TG; 6 males, 19 females), and (b) the control group 
(CG; 5 males, 16 females), whose members received the 
standard clinical care, namely they continued taking their 
prescribed medication and receiving the needed treatment 
(e.g., physiotherapy, psychotherapy etc). This group of 
patients, for ethical reasons, was offered the opportunity to 
the 
undertake 
study period. 





The diagnosis of MCI was made in accordance with 
Petersen’s criteria (Petersen et al., 2013). According to 
Petersen et al. (2013), the diagnostic criteria of MCI are: (1) 
intact activities of daily living 
memory complaints, 
IADL; 
(using Instrumental Activities of Daily Living; 
Lawton, Moss, Fulcomer, & Kleban, 2003; 
for Greek 
Theotoka, et al., 2007), (3) a score of 1.5 SD below the 
mean on neuropsychological measures (which is considered 
to be the standard cutoff point between healthy subjects and 
subjects with cognitive deficits), (4) no dementia, (5) impair- 
ment in at least one cognitive domain (e.g., complex atten- 
learning, memory). All patients 
tion, executive function, 
fulfilled all 
inclusion criteria 
were: (1) general cognitive function (MoCa score from 20 to 
25) 
(Jak et al., 2016; Konstantopoulos, Vogazianos, & 
Doskas, 2016), (2) age between 60–80 years and (3) at least 
6 years of education, (4) the severity of functional impair- 
ment with Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR; Golomb, 
Kluger, & Ferris, 2004) to be 0.5 ¼ mild cognitive impair- 
ment. The researcher submits the scores to a computer pro- 
gram which presents each participant’s dementia rating. 

On the other hand, exclusion criteria were: (1) presence 
of an additional neurological (e.g., stroke, epilepsy, and trau- 
matic brain injury) or psychiatric disorder (e.g., psychotic 
symptoms or disorders, alcohol or illegal drug abuse), (2) 
presence of depression, which was evaluated with Geriatric 
Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15; Yesavage & Sheikh, 1986; for 
Greek Foutoulakis et al., 1999); a score below 5 points on 
the GDS-15 is suggestive of depression, (3) visual/hearing 
impairment or writing/reading disability sufficient to impair 



the performance in the assessment and the training. All par- 
ticipants had undergone a clinical neurological assessment 
with neurological examination, 
laboratory tests and brain 
magnetic resonance imaging scans, which presented no evi- 
dence of other neurological or psychiatric diseases. 
The evaluation of the participants was performed separ- 
ately by both a neurologist and an experienced neuropsych- 
ologist pre and post the intervention program. Both the 
neurologist and the neuropsychologist were blind to the 
allocation of participants to groups (training and control). 
All the collected data was reviewed, and diagnoses were 
assigned using published criteria, after expert consensus 
meetings, including the neurologists (who examined the par- 
ticipants) and the neuropsychologists (who performed the 
neuropsychological batteries). To sum up, the diagnosis of 
MCI was based on Petersen criteria, additional inclusion cri- 
teria and neurological and neuropsychological assessment. 
All subtypes of MCI patients were included in the study, 
namely with deficits in a single or multiple domains with 
and without memory problems. Due to the relatively small 
sample size, however, it was not able to assess the effects of 
the intervention on the subgroups separately. 



1. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Smith, Gildeh, 
& Jolmes, 2007; for Greek Konstantopoulos et al., 2016): 
A brief 30-question test. Scores range from 0 to 30, 
with a score of 26 and higher generally considered nor- 
mal. The cognitive areas and scoring breakdown is as 
follows: visuospatial and executive functioning: 5 points, 
animal naming: 3 points, attention: 6 points, language: 
3 points, abstraction: 2 points, delayed recall (Short- 
term Memory): 5 points, orientation: 6 points. One 
point is added to participants’ score if (s)he has 12 years 
or less of formal education. 
2. Clock Drawing Test (CDT; (Nair et al., 2010): The clin- 
ician gives the person being tested a piece of paper with 
a pre-drawn circle on it and asks him/her to draw the 
numbers on the clock. Then the patients have to draw 
the clock hands indicating 10 min past 11. The 15-point 
range was divided into four subgroups: clock outline 
(2 points), numerals (6 points), time setting (6 points), 
and center (1 point). 
3. Recall, recognition and delay memory were evaluated 
with the use of immediate word recall, word recognition 
and delayed word memory test 
(Kokkinins, 2019; 
Kosmidou, Bozikas, & Vlaxou, 2012): A list of 10 words 
is given to the patients and they have to repeat as many 
as they can in every try (4 tries). Then, a new list with 
twenty words is given verbally (10 words from the pre- 
vious list and 10 new words). This time patients have to 
recognize which word is new and which is not. In the 
last task (delay memory), after 30 min, patients have to 
recall as many words as they can from the first list 
(10 words) 

(BNT; Kaplan, Goodglass, & 
Weitraub, 2001; for Greek Messinis, Panagea, Kastelakis, 
& Papathanasopoulos, 2013): The participants 
are 
instructed to name 15 line drawings of both common

and rarely seen objects, each one in around 20 s. Every 
correct answer is awarded with one point, 
thus the 
maximum score is 15. 
Semantic Fluency measure (SF; Tombaugh, Kozak, & 
Rees, 1999; for Greek Kosmidou, Vlahou, Panagiotaki, 
& Kiosseoglou, 2004): The participants are given 30 s to 
generate as many distinct words as possible for each of 
three categories: fruit, vegetables and objects. The scores 
for all the categories are summed. 
6. Attention and working memory were explored with the 
use of the digit span forward (DSF) and digit span back- 
ward (DSB) test (Richardson, 2007): It involves the oral 
presentation of spans of digits. The measure has both a 
7-item digits forward task and a 7-item digits backward 
task, each one with its own individual score. As the two 
paradigms measure distinct function, the disparate scores 
allow for richer interpretation than that provided by 
similar assessment instruments on the market. 
7. Visual attention, executive function and processing 
speed were evaluated with the use of the Trail-making 
Test, part A, part B (TMT-A & TMT-B; Tombaugh, 
Rees, & McIntyre, 1998; 
for Greek Vlachou & 
Kosmidou, 2012): Both parts of the Trail Making Test 
consist of 25 circles distributed over a sheet of paper. In 
Part A, the circles are numbered from 1 to 25, and the 
patient should draw lines to connect the numbers in 
ascending order. In Part B, 
the circles include both 
numbers (1–13) and letters (A–L) and the patient has 
not only to draw lines to connect the circles in an 
ascending pattern, but also conduct the added task of 
alternating between the numbers and letters (i.e., 1-A-2- 
B-3-C, etc.). The patient, in both tasks, is instructed to 
connect the circles as quickly as possible, without lifting 
the pen or pencil from the paper. It is unnecessary to 
continue the test if the patient has not completed both 
parts after 5 min have elapse. 




(attention- 
processing speed, executive function, immediate and delayed 
word, recall and recognition, naming, semantic fluency) was 
measured before (at baseline) and one week after the com- 
pletion of the computer- based multidomain cognitive train- 
ing (endpoint). 


The TG received in total 30 60-min individual sessions over 
a period of 15 weeks (i.e., two sessions per week). The multi- 
domain cognitive training intervention program was based 
on the use of the elderly-friendly software package named 
RehaCom Cognitive Therapy Software which has been uti- 
lized extensively in Europe over the last couple of years for 
the purpose of providing 
computer-assisted cognitive 
rehabilitation. Moreover, the software which has over 20 
including Greek. 
modules is available in many languages, 
The RehaCom consists of a specially-designed input panel 
and a large screen that helps patients be trained in several 
cognitive domains, such as episodic and delayed memory, 
verbal memory, attention, processing speed and executive 
function. All participants began training at the beginner’s 
level of the RehaCom software. The training modules auto- 
matically adapted the training tasks to the user’s level of 
performance, providing the opportunity to train patients on 
several levels of difficulty and length of sessions and, accord- 
ing to whether the patient succeeded or failed the task, the 
difficulty levels were automatically adjusted to meet 
the 
patient’s ability. All patients were trained on the same tasks 
session. 
(min/task) 
for 
Neuropsychological assessment included tests of attention, 
processing speed, verbal fluency, working, delay and visuo- 
spatial memory, recall, recognition, naming and executive 
function. The cognitive training with the use of RehaCom 
software was also based on those evaluated sectors. 





research protocol was approved by the Ethics 
Committee of the Medical School of Larissa, University of 
Thessaly, and it was conducted in accordance with the princi- 
ples of 
the Declaration of Helsinki. Written consent was 
obtained from all the participants after having been informed 
of the nature of the study they would take part in. Moreover, 
the participants were informed of the option of terminating 
the experiment at any time they wished without there being a 
requirement to provide any justification for their decision.

Independent 
Sample T-tests were performed. A series of 2 (cid:2) 2 mixed 
ANOVAs, with Group as the between-subjects independent 
variable and Time as the within-subjects independent vari- 
able, was conducted to explore their interaction effects on 
the dependent variables (Recall, Delayed memory, Word rec- 
ognition, BNT, SF, CDT, DSF, DSB, TMT-A, TMT-B). 
Further within group comparisons, using Paired Samples 
T-tests, were obtained, in order for the performance of each 
group before and after the intervention to be explored. 
The effect of the intervention was estimated by comparing 
the mean difference of the two assessments (baseline minus 
endpoint in each group) between the groups (training group 
vs. controls), with the use of Independent-Samples T-test. 
Cohen’s d and the effect size of the intervention were calcu- 
lated according to the site https://www.uccs.edu/lbecker/. 
Correction for multiple testing comparison was assessed we 
used the false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini & Hochberg, 
1995). The level of significance was set at 0.05 for all the anal- 
yses. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 
(version 21) statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). 

No statistically significant differences were found in baseline 
characteristics between the two groups, apart from their per- 
formance in the Semantic Fluency task, in which the CG

achieved higher scores compared to the TG [t(44)

Table 3 presents the mean scores (and standard devia- 
tions) for each measure and each group in both assessment 
times, as well as the difference between the two assessments 
(p-values). As we can see, the TG improved its performance 
in all the tested cognitive domains. In particular, the TG 
patients’ improvement, after the intervention, reached sig- 
nificance in, Delayed memory, Word recognition, BNT, SF, 
CDT, TMT-A and TMT-B. In DSF and DSB, however, TG 
patients’ improvement did not manage to reach significance. 
On the contrary, the controls remained stable in most of the 
neuropsychological measures over the observation period of 
15 weeks. In three cognitive measures, however, their end- 
point performance was statistically significantly lower, com- 
pared to that of their initial performance (DSB, Delayed 
memory, SF). 


Comparison between the two groups (TG vs. CG) in the

Since in the AD continuum, the prodromal state of MCI 
precedes AD (Dardiotis et al., 2019; Oltra-Cucarella et al., 
2018; Slot et al., 2019; Varatharajah, Ramanan, Iyer, & 
Vemuri, 2019), being able to map and improve patients’ 
impairments in this early stage, is of significant importance, 
as it might lead to an effective way to dramatically delay or 
even prevent the appearance of AD. 
Having this in mind, and based on systematic reviews on 
cognitive training, which have demonstrated promising 
effects on subjects with MCI (Belleville, 2008; Cooper et al., 
2013; Gates, Sachdev, Fiatarone Singh, & Valenzuela, 2011; 
Ge et al., 2018; Jean, Bergeron, Thivierge, & Simard, 2010), 
especially when multidomain computer-based cognitive 
trainings were used (Ge et al., 2018), we wanted to examine 
the effects of the RehaCom software on Greek patients with 
MCI and add to the existing evidence. 
The RehaCom software has already been used on Greek 
patients with mild AD (Nousia et al., 2018), multiple scler- 
osis (Dardiotis et al., 2017; Messinis et al., 2018; Nasios 
et al., 2018) and brain injuries (Pantzartzidou et al., 2017) 
with positive results, but never before has it been used in 
examining whether such an intervention can also positively 
affect people with mild cognitive problems. 
The present study provides evidence that individualized, 
computer-based multidomain cognitive training in patients 
with MCI being applied twice a week, for 60 min per session 
improves all cognitive functions. In particular, our results 
demonstrated that the RehaCom software had a significant 
impact on delayed memory, word recognition, naming, 
semantic fluency, attention, processing speed and executive 
function. It is worth noting that, even though executive 
functions scores were slow before and after the training, the 
training group improved significantly compared to the con- 
trol group. These low scores pre and post training are con- 
sistent with previous studies for TMT-A (Guo, Zhou, Zhao, 
Whang, & Hong, 2012; Wei et al., 2018; Zhao, Li, Lin, Wei, 
& Yang, 2018) and TMT-B (Guo et al., 2012; Terada et al., 
2013; Wei et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018). 

These findings confirm our hypothesis, according to which 
the training group’s performance on standardized neuro- 
psychological assessments was expected to be improved after 
the intervention, when compared to its baseline performance. 
Moreover, these results are in agreement with previous 
research in MCI, according to which multidomain training 
programs had a significant 
in delayed memory 
(Hwang et al., 2012; Olchik et al., 2013; Savulich et al., 
2017), executive function and processing speed (Greenaway 
et al., 2013), naming and semantic fluency (Gooding et al., 
2016; Rojas et al., 2013). On the other hand, the study by 
Hwang et al. (2012) mentioned no statistical improvement 
in patients with MCI, as far as recognition and working 
memory is concerned (Hwang et al., 2012). Differences 
regarding the intervention program, as well as the frequency 
and the duration of the intervention sessions can possibly 
account for the different findings. 
According to our second hypothesis, the training group 
was expected to demonstrate a better performance in most of 
the trained domains compared to the controls. This hypoth- 
esis was also supported, since the results revealed better per- 
formance of the TG in all cognitive domains compared to the 
controls, although in three out of the ten measures this per- 
formance did not reach the significance threshold. These 


results are in line with previous studies, where statistically sig- 
nificant differences between the two groups were found in 
some (Delbroek et al., 2017; Hwang et al., 2012) or even all 
(Bahar-Fuchs et al., 2013; Gooding et al., 2016; Mansbach 
et al., 2017) of the trained cognitive domains, with the trained 
group revealing a better performance when compared to the 
controls. Moreover, in order to evaluate the personal benefit 
to each patient gained from the intervention, we informally 
asked treated patients to provide feedback regarding the inter- 
vention on verbal questions at the post intervention assess- 
ment. Specifically, the TG mentioned positive feedback on 
daily activities and functional communication. 

Certain limitations, however, need to be acknowledged. 
Firstly, 
follow-up 
period. Thus, a longer follow-up period would have allowed 
for more robust and trustworthy results (Llewellyn-Bennett, 
Bowman, & Bulbulia, 2016). Furthermore, considering the 
relatively small sample size, our study might be underpowered 
to examine the complete and absolute effect of computer-based 
multidomain cognitive training on MCI. In addition, because 
of the relatively small sample size, it was not feasible to assess 
the effects of the intervention on MCI subtypes separately. 
Future studies should examine whether patients with a specific 
MCI subtype (i.e., amnestic MCI) may benefit more than other 
subtypes from a multidomain cognitive training program. 
Finally, a possible Hawthorne effect in the intervention cannot 
be completely excluded (Sedgwick & Greenwood, 2015). Thus, 
further studies applied to larger groups of patients are required 
in order for the effect of computer-based multidomain cogni- 
tive training and its clinical meaning on MCI patients to be 
properly illustrated. 

The present study demonstrates the beneficial 
impact of 
computer-based multidomain cognitive training on the cog- 
nitive performance of patients with MCI. Considering the 
connection between MCI and AD, this data is promising for 
developing training methods in order to restrict cognitive 
decline or delay the progression of the disease to mild AD.
