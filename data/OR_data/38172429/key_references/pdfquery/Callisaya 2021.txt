Background: Evidence-based interventions to improve mobility in older people include balance, strength and 
cognitive training. Digital technologies provide the opportunity to deliver tailored and progressive programs at 
home. However, it is unknown if they are effective in older people, especially in those with cognitive 
impairment. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of a novel tablet-delivered cognitive-motor program 
on mobility in older people with cognitive impairment. 
Methods: This was a 6-month single-blind randomised controlled trial of older people living in the community 
with subjective and/or objective cognitive impairment. Participants randomised to the intervention were asked 
to follow a 120 min per week balance, strength and cognitive training program delivered via an app on an iPad. 
Both the intervention and control group received monthly phone calls and health fact sheets. The primary 
outcome measure was gait speed. Secondary measures included dual-task gait speed, balance (step test, FISCIT- 
4), 5 sit to stand test, cognition (executive function, memory, attention), mood and balance confidence. 
Adherence, safety, usability and feedback were also measured. 
Results: The planned sample size of 110 was not reached due to COVID-19 restrictions. A total of 93 (mean age 
72.8 SD 7.0 years) participants were randomised to the two groups. Of these 77 participants returned to the 
follow-up clinic. In intention-to-treat analysis for gait speed, there was a non-significant improvement favouring 
the intervention group (β 0.04 m/s 95% CI -0.01, 0.08). There were no significant findings for secondary out- 
comes. Adherence was excellent (84.5%), usability of the app high (76.7% SD 15.3) and no serious adverse 
events were reported. Feedback on the app was positive and included suggestions for future updates. 
Conclusion: Due to COVID-19 the trial was under powered to detect significant results. Despite this, there was a 
trend towards improvement in the primary outcome measure. The excellent adherence and positive feedback 
about the app suggest a fully powered trial is warranted. 

Adequate mobility in old age is important to maintain independence 
in activities of daily living and participate in leisure activities (Callisaya 
and Verghese, 2018). Gait speed is commonly used to measure mobility 
objectively, and slow gait speed is associated with a number of adverse 
outcomes including disability (Perera et al., 2016), falls (Callisaya et al., 
2011) hospitalisation and increased need for care (Montero-Odasso 

Word Association Test; FICSIT-4, Frailty and Injuries Cooperative Studies of Intervention Techniques test.

et al., 2005). There are a number of factors that contribute to slow gait 
speed, with two of the most modifiable being muscle weakness and poor 
balance (Callisaya et al., 2009; Tiedemann et al., 2005). Cognitive 
ability is also important for maintaining gait speed, having a role in 
responding quickly to perturbations, being able to carry out a secondary 
task, and analysing and decision-making in complex environments 
(Jayakody et al., 2020; Martin et al., 2013a). In line with this, poorer 
cognition, especially the domains of executive function and processing 
speed, are associated with slower gait speed (Martin et al., 2013a) and 
risk of falls (Muir et al., 2012; Martin et al., 2013b). Importantly, having 
subjective or objective cognitive impairment in combination with slow 
gait speed increases the risk of falls to a greater extent than slow gait 
speed alone (Martin et al., 2013b; Callisaya et al., 2016). 
In people with cognitive impairment, exercise alone or in combina- 
tion with cognitive training can improve mobility (Lam et al., 2018; 
Zhang et al., 2019). Technology may provide a novel way to deliver 
interventions and enhance adherence and enjoyment for older people in 
their own homes, with the additional benefit of incorporating behaviour 
reinforcements such as feedback on performance and goal attainment 
(Valenzuela et al., 2018). The StandingTall program is an app that de- 
livers a tailored and progressive balance and strength program to pre- 
vent falls in older people, with incorporated feedback and goal setting 
(Delbaere et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2020). Recently, the app was 
modified to include the addition of cognitive exercises (inhibition, 
working memory and task shifting) that are performed in combination 
with the balance exercises. However, the efficacy of the app on mobility 
in people with cognitive impairment has not been examined. 
Therefore, the aim of this study was, in people with subjective 
cognitive decline and/or objective cognitive impairment, to: (i) examine 
the efficacy of a 6-month StandingTall program on improving known fall 
risk factors – single-task gait speed (primary outcome measure), dual- 
task gait speed, balance, strength, reaction time and cognitive func- 
tion; (ii) examine the adherence, acceptability, safety and satisfaction of 
the program; and (iii) determine feasibility for a larger study examining 
efficacy on risk of falls. 


This was a two-arm parallel-randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 
6-months follow-up carried out in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. The trial 
was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (Tasmania) 
Network (H0016983) and prospectively registered on the Australian and 
New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12618001062213). 
Funding was provided by the National Health and Medical Research 
Council (1135761). 

Participants were recruited through general practitioners, hospital 
geriatric clinics, advertisements in the local newspaper, talks at retire- 
ment villages and other community organisations. Inclusion criteria 
included: >60 years of age; willing to adhere to the study procedures for 
6-months and attend the pre- and post-clinics; cognitive impairment (a 
subjective cognitive decline over past 5 years and/or a Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment [MOCA] scores between 19 and 26 and/or a 
medical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment); ability to walk in own 
home without a gait aide or furniture. Exclusion criteria included de- 
mentia, a score of <19 on the MOCA or a MOCA between 19 and 26 and 
a score of >9 on the Functional Activities Questionnaire. Other exclu- 
sion criteria included an unstable medical condition precluding exercise, 
other neurological conditions (e.g. Parkinson's disease, multiple scle- 
rosis or stroke), residing in a nursing home, participating in another 
clinical trial that would bias the outcomes or participating in an exercise 
program designed to improve balance, and life expectancy <12 months. 


Participants were randomised after baseline assessment. Random- 
isation was stratified by age (<70 or ≥ 70 years) and sex with permuted 
blocks of ten. A research nurse not involved in the assessment of out- 
comes or the intervention carried out the randomisation using a central 
automated allocation procedure based on computer-generated random 
numbers. Outcomes assessors were blinded to study group assignment. 


Both the control and intervention group received monthly health 
information fact sheets via post on topics such as eyesight, diet, footwear 
and physical activity for the duration of the trial. Both groups also 
received a monthly phone call to ask about falls (see outcomes). 


Intervention group participants received an iPad with the Stand- 
ingTall program. The program consisted of progressively more difficult 
balance, strength and cognitive exercises tailored to the person. Par- 
ticipants were provided with an internet connection if they did not have 
one at home. An initial visit (1(cid:0) 2h) by an exercise physiologist or 
physiotherapist was undertaken to explain the use of the equipment, to 
ensure a safe location to exercise, to carry out an initial balance 
assessment via the app to tailor the program to the person's ability, and 
carry out one 10-min exercise session. Follow-up visits to review prog- 
ress and features of the app occurred in weeks 2 and 8 (<1 h) and then by 
monthly phone calls. The program built to a total of 2 h of balance ex- 
ercises per week (from 40 min in weeks 1 and 2, to 120 min from week 9 
onwards), with cognitive dual-tasking exercises added in week 8 (see 
Fig. 1 for examples of the exercises; range of >6000 exercise variations). 
Balance exercises incorporate movement of the centre of mass, nar- 
rowing of base of support, minimising upper limb support, turning and 
changing directions, ankle/hip and stepping strategies, challenging 
vision, sensation and vestibular systems and stepping up and over ob- 
jects. Cognitive tasks are added to balance exercises by using auditory 
and visual cues. Three core executive functions are engaged: inhibition 
(the ability to consciously override automated or dominant responses), 
working memory (the ability to hold, process, and manipulate infor- 
mation in mind) and task shifting (the ability to switch flexibly between 
tasks or mental sets). Safety measures included setting up the environ- 
ment (e.g. near a table or chair for support; appropriate footwear; 
exclusion of foam or box exercises if deemed unsafe; use of carer/partner 
if required; instructions to keep a phone nearby; information leaflet on 
what to do in the case of a fall). Participants were also provided with an 
instruction booklet that included information on safe exercise tips and 
use of the iPad and the app. The difficulty of the balance and cognitive 
exercises progressed (in complexity and length) automatically, based on 
participant's self-reported rating of each exercise. The app provided 
videos and instructions for each exercise. Each exercise was repeated 
three times. Participants could choose the time they wished to exercise 
(e.g. 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 min) to reach the weekly time goal. Feedback 
on adherence to participants was available through the app via a weekly 
counter and a graph, and to researchers via a dashboard following data 
transfer to a secure server kept by Neuroscience Research Australia. 
Other features of the app included exercise notification reminders and 
(optional) individualised goal setting. 







Gait speed (m/s) was measured on a 6.4 m Zeno electronic walkway 
(Zenometrics LLC, Peekskill, NY) with ProKinetics Movement Analysis 
Software (PKMAS). Participants completed four walks that started 1.5 m 
before and finished 1.5 m after the walkway to allow for acceleration 
and deceleration. 

Dual-task gait: Gait speed (m/s) was measured as described above 
while performing a secondary cognitive task (counting backwards in 3 s 
and alternating letters of the alphabet). Cognitive function was obtained 
with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery that included the 
Trail Making Test, Victoria Stroop task, Controlled Oral Word 
Association Test (COWAT) animals, Digital Symbol Coding tests and the 
Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (Lezak, 1995); Muscle strength with the 5 
sit to stand test; Balance with the 15 s step test and the Frailty and In- 
juries Cooperative Studies of Intervention Techniques test (FICSIT-4) 
(Rossiter-Fornoff et al., 1995); Balance confidence with the Activities 
Balance Confidence Scale and Mood with the Geriatric Depression Scale 
(Yesavage et al., 1982). Other information to describe the sample at 
baseline included age, sex, self-reported medical history, activities of 
daily living (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living – Prevention in- 
strument) (Galasko et al., 2006) and Lifespace with the Life-space 
questionnaire (how far and often a person goes outside of their home) 
(Baker et al., 2003). Falls were obtained monthly via a phone call for six 
months and were defined as ‘an unexpected event in which the 



participant comes to rest on the ground, floor or lower level’ (Lamb 
et al., 2005). 

In the intervention group, usability of the app was assessed with the 
System Usability Scale (Bangor et al., 2008) and feedback about the app 
features were obtained with a structured questionnaire developed by the 
researchers. The questionnaire included a five-point Likert scale 
regarding the overall rating of the program and friendless, as well as 
open ended questions about reasons for participation in the study, 
benefits of the app and what participants liked or didn't like about the 
program. Exercise adherence (volume, frequency) was monitored for 6 
months. Adherence was calculated as a percentage of the minutes pre- 
scribed for that week. If a participant withdrew then adherence was 
calculated until the date of withdrawal. Adverse events were defined as a 
fall or cardiac event during the exercise program or a musculoskeletal 
injury potentially or definitely due to the program. 


For the primary outcome of gait speed a sample size of 110 was 
calculated to provide sufficient power (90%, 2-tailed, p < 0.05) to detect 
a clinically meaningful difference of 0.1 m/s (SD 0.15) between groups 
allowing for a 10% drop out (Perera et al., 2006). For other measures a 
sample of n = 110, 80% power (2-tailed p < 0.05) provided power to 
detect effect sizes as low as 0.269 (using the F-test). 











Numbers of participants screened, eligible, having baseline and 
follow-up assessment, withdrawals and numbers included in the ana- 
lyses were reported in accordance with the CONSORT flow chart. The 
characteristics of the sample at baseline were summarised overall and by 
group using the means and standard errors for continuous measures and 
by frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Linear mixed 
effect models and intention-to-treat analyses were used to assess the 
effect of time for each group and group×time on outcomes reporting 
beta-coefficients and 95% confidence intervals in an unadjusted model. 
A second model was examined including age and sex and additionally 
any covariates identified as being clinically different between groups at 
baseline. In sub-analyses, we repeated the analysis for the primary 
outcome excluding those who adhered to less than 70% of the program. 
Open-ended questions were reported descriptively to highlight themes 
in responses. 

Over 12 months (April 2019–March 2020), 135 participants were 
screened for eligibility, of whom 93 (mean age 72.8 SD 7.0 years; 42% 
male) were randomised and assigned to the intervention or control 
group (Fig. 2 CONSORT statement). 

The planned sample size of 110 was not achieved due to COVID-19 
restrictions halting the ability to run face-to-face clinics and home 
visits. One participant allocated to the intervention was also unable to 
start due to social distancing restrictions. No follow-up clinics were able 
to run between the end of March 2020 and July 2020. Participants were 
invited to return for the final clinics in mid July 2020 after easing of 
some COVID-19 restrictions, but some participants declined due to on- 
going concerns. Recruitment did not recommence due to the on-going 
uncertainty of the pandemic. Fig. 1 provides reasons for withdrawal, 
with 77 participants returning to the final clinic. 

Baseline characteristics of the sample are summarised in Table 1. 
There were some notable clinical difference between groups for the 
proportion of past falls, diabetes and pain levels. Statistical tests be- 
tween groups for characteristics were not performed in-line with the 
CONSORT statement (Schulz et al., 2010). Table 2 provides the unad- 
justed means and standard errors for the primary and secondary out- 
comes at baseline and 6 months, the mean change over time in each 
group and the adjusted (Model 1 unadjusted; Model 2 adjusted for age, 
sex, pain, diabetes and past falls) between group differences. The results 
did not meaningfully differ between the unadjusted and adjusted results. 
There was no significant difference between groups for the primary 
outcome measure of gait speed (β 0.04 m/s 95% CI -0.01, 0.08; p = 
0.09). In sub-analysis excluding those whose adherence to the program 
was less than 70% (n = 9) did not meaningfully change the results (β 
0.04 95%CI -0.01, 0.08; p = 0.09). 

There was also no other significant differences for secondary 
outcome measures. Over the 6-month period, falls were reported by 29% 
(13.7% had multiple falls) of the intervention group and 22.4% of the 
control group reported a fall (8.1% had multiple falls). As the sample 
was heterogeneous in relation to cognition, we carried out an a-poste- 
riori analysis stratifying the sample by the MoCA (≥ 26; <26) (Nas- 
reddine et al., 2005). There was one significant finding (out of 19 
comparisons) of greater improvement in gait speed during the dual-task 
numbers test favouring the intervention group (Supplementary Table 1).

The overall adherence to the program in the intervention group was 
84.5%. Of participants completing the full intervention period (n = 30) 
the adherence was 91.5% over the 6 months. In those that did not 
complete the full period (n = 11) adherence was 69.5%. 
User experience questionnaire. 
The average score on the system usability scale was 76.7/100 (SD 
15.3). The percentage of participants reporting a subjective benefit of 
the program (yes/no) was 89.1%. Overall ratings on the program were 
as follows: 32.4% rated it as very good, 54.0% as good and 13.5% as 
neither good nor bad. User-friendliness of the program was rated as 
follows: 27.0% as very good; 54% good and 18.9% as neither good nor 
bad. No participants rated the overall program or user-friendliness as 
poor or very poor. 

There were 7 adverse events potentially or definitely due to the 
program. This included one non-injurious fall using the box (which was 
then turned off for this participant) and 6 complaints of new, or 
aggravation of existing, musculoskeletal pain (three definitely and two 
potentially related to the exercise program). Two musculoskeletal events 
(hip and knee pain) occurred in the same participant and one further 
event in a separate participant (knee pain). It was determined that the 
box exercises were the contributing factor and were subsequently turned 
off for these participants. 

Improving balance and memory, preventing falls and dementia, and 
supporting research were given as the main reasons for participating in 
the trial. Participants liked the commitment, discipline and flexibility to 
do the exercise at home, and the mental and physical challenges the 
program offered. Participants reported subjective improvement in bal- 
ance, confidence, memory and processing speed. Some participants 
noted that the program was somewhat repetitive and boring, others 
expressed that certain exercises were too difficult. Competing work or

This randomised controlled trial examined the efficacy of an inno- 
vative app that delivered a tailored and progressive physical and 
cognitive exercise program to older people with subjective and objective 
cognitive impairment. The StandingTall program resulted in a non- 
significant difference in the primary outcome of gait speed of 0.04 m/ 
s (95% CI -0.01, 0.08) in a group of older people with subjective and 
objective cognitive impairment. 
The StandingTall program targets balance, strength and cognition, 
factors associated with poor mobility and risk of falls in older people. 
Prior meta-analyses have found cognitive training alone (Marusic et al., 
2018) or physical interventions such as combined resistance, balance 
and endurance exercises can improve mobility (Van Abbema et al., 
2015). Further systematic reviews also support combined cognitive- 
motor training to improve mobility (Zhang et al., 2019; Gavelin et al., 
2020), with simultaneous better than sequential exercise (Tait et al., 
2017). The mean difference between groups of 0.04 m/s is clinically 
small (Perera et al., 2006), but similar to findings of a meta-analysis 
examining the effect of progressive resistance and balance training or 
multi-modal training on gait speed (Van Abbema et al., 2015). 
In many previous studies exercise was performed in groups or 
outside participants' home (Zhang et al., 2019), which may not suit all 
older people (Yardley et al., 2008). Reported barriers to exercise include 
time, self-efficacy, motivation and access to classes (Ziebart et al., 2018). 
Technology provides a feasible way for older people to exercise in their 
own home (Taylor et al., 2020; Daly et al., 2021; Simpson et al., 2020; 
Geraedts et al., 2017; van Het Reve et al., 2014), which has the potential 
to increase long-term adherence (Valenzuela et al., 2018). Adherence 
(obtained by the program itself rather than self-reported by the partic- 
ipant) was excellent, and similar or better than prior studies that used 
technology to deliver exercise over similar (Geraedts et al., 2017) or 
shorter periods (Daly et al., 2021). Participants knew that they were 
being monitored, and so this may have provided additional motivation/ 
discipline. However, adherence was lower in those who eventually 
withdrew from the program early. Motivation and self-efficacy are 
important factors to consider when starting an exercise program and 
some older people may require greater assistance in staying motivated 



and choosing programs that meet their needs and preferences (Ziebart 
et al., 2018). 
Participants reported subjective benefits in terms of balance and 
memory, and liked the discipline and flexibility of doing the program at 
home. The majority of participants also expressed that they wanted 
exercises to improve mobility and prevent falls and dementia, suggest- 
ing a need for such programs. There is potential for the StandingTall 
program to be offered to all older people with subjective cognitive 
impairment at a population-wide level. Alternatively, StandingTall could 
be prescribed by health professionals as a stand-alone intervention or in 
conjunction with face-to-face or group classes. Experience from this 
study suggests that an initial home visit is essential in people with 
subjective or objective cognitive impairment to ensure safety of the 
home set up and additional tailoring of the exercises. Follow-up visits 
were useful to reinforce safety, and also to assist those participants who 
were unfamiliar with using technology. Furthermore, engaging part- 
ners/family to supervise exercises and six-monthly reviews may be 
useful to check on safety, especially if a decline in cognitive function is 
expected. 
An unexpected aspect of the program was that for some people it 
highlighted their strengths and weaknesses with some perceptively 
reporting differences in left and right leg balance or in visual versus 
verbal recall ability. However, some participants found the time needed 
to commit to the program difficult, with five people withdrawing due to 
being too busy. Some reported the exercises often took them longer than 
the time chosen, and this was reported as a frustration. Others thought 
that the exercises were repetitive, although this was also recognised as 
important for improvement. Subsequent versions of the app may need to 
look at reducing the time between exercises. Feedback provided on the 
program will assist in developing the app for future widespread scale-up. 

In addition to the impact of COVID-19 on recruitment, six partici- 
pants did not return to the final clinic due to COVID-19 concerns, two 
participants dropped out of the intervention due to medical conditions 
(stroke and total hip replacement), and five reported they were too busy 
to complete the program. In addition, musculoskeletal events were re- 
ported by 5 participants. The box exercise aggravated some participants 
pre-existing hip and knee pain and therefore this exercise may need to be 
modified by starting with a smaller step or strengthening provided using 
alternative exercises. Older people are likely to have medical problems, 
and it is a balance between excluding those with chronic conditions and 
generalisability. The majority of participants already had Wi-Fi at home, 
and it is possible technology naive older people may require greater 
training than provided in this study. Finally, feedback on the program 
was obtained via a questionnaire. Qualitative interviews may have 
resulted in richer information about the intervention and its delivery 
method. 
In conclusion, although we did not find significant differences be- 
tween groups, participants found the StandingTall app easy to use and 
reported subjective benefits from the program including improved 
functioning. The program appears feasible in terms of recruitment and 
adherence for people with subjective and objective cognitive impair- 
ment and warrants a larger definitive trial to determine efficacy.
