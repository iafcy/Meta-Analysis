Abstract 
Background The effectiveness of computer-based cognitive training (CCT) remains controversial, especially in older adults 
with neurodegenerative diseases. 
Aims To evaluate the efficacy of CCT in patients with Parkinson’s disease and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). 
Methods In this randomized controlled trial, 53 patients were randomized to receive CCT delivered by means of CoRe 
software, traditional paper-and-pencil cognitive training (PCT), or an unstructured activity intervention (CG). In each group, 
the intervention lasted 3 consecutive weeks (4 individual face-to-face sessions/week). Neuropsychological assessment was 
administered at baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1). Outcome measures at T0 and T1 were compared within and between 
groups. The Montreal Overall Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was taken as the primary outcome measure. 
Results Unlike the PCT group and the CG, the patients receiving CCT showed significant medium/large effect size improve- 
ments in MoCA performance, global cognition, executive functions, and attention/processing speed. No baseline individual/ 
demographic variables were associated with greater gains from the intervention, although a negative correlation with baseline 
MoCA performance was found. 
Conclusion CCT proved effective in PD-MCI patients when compared with traditional PCT. Further follow-up assess- 
ments are being conducted to verify the retention of the gains and the potential ability of the tool to delay conversion to 
PD-dementia.

Cognitive training (CT) is a non-pharmacological interven- 
tion that has long been used to target cognition in a range 
of neurological disorders, including age-related cognitive 
decline [1–3]. CT can be delivered using traditional paper- 
and-pencil techniques (PCT) or by means of more innovative 
computer-based solutions (CCT). With respect to traditional 
PCT, CCT provides real-time feedback, allows modulation 
of task complexity and response time during and across ses- 
sions, requires less exercise preparation (therefore saving 
therapists time), and allows recording of all session param- 
eters. Finally, CCT, requiring less face-to-face training, can 



 
be delivered remotely, as a telemedicine intervention, to 
patients at home [4]. 
CCT seems to be efficacious in the early phases of cog- 
nitive decline, and particularly in cases of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) [5, 6]; however, this evidence refers 
mainly to MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease. To date, few 
studies have focused on Parkinson’s disease (PD) (see [7–13] 
for review), and even fewer on PD patients with MCI (PD- 
MCI) [2, 14]. Since motor difficulties can potentially inter- 
fere with PD patients’ participation in cognitive interven- 
tions, CCT may be particularly suitable for them, as the tools 
used can be developed to be user-friendly even for patients 
with motor and visuo-spatial difficulties [2, 14]. However, 
more and better-designed RCTs are needed to examine the 
usability and usefulness of CCT in PD-MCI patients. 
In recent years, we implemented a software tool for cog- 
nitive rehabilitation called “CoRe” [4, 15, 16]. CoRe is an 
adaptive CCT program for individual face-to-face sessions 
between patient and therapist. In a previous study, we pre- 
liminarily tested its usability and safety as a clinical tool in 
dementia-related disorders with a view to optimizing it and 
making it easier for patients to use [16]. In another study, 
we demonstrated its effectiveness in single-domain train- 
ing targeting logical-executive functions in PD-MCI inpa- 
tients [4]. However, considering the importance of multi- 
domain interventions, designed to produce broader effects 
across different cognitive domains [2], we here adopted an 
extended version of CoRe. The new version is a patient- 
tailored, multi-domain CT tool targeting logical-executive 
functions, attention/processing speed, working memory, and 
episodic memory. 
The main aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of this 
extended version of CoRe in PD-MCI patients using an RCT 
design. To this end, we compared this CCT intervention with 
the same stimulation activities delivered using a traditional 
PCT approach, and with an active control group (CG). The 
comparison of the CCT with the PCT group was intended 
to provide evidence on the efficacy of computer-based ver- 
sus paper-and-pencil activities, and the comparison of these 
two groups with the CG to provide useful information on 
the importance of structured versus unstructured cognitive 
activities. Finally, we also explored the role of individual 
differences (e.g., age, education, cognitive reserve) in train- 
ing gains to predict which patients may benefit most from 
CCT [17]. 



at the C. Mondino Foundation. The protocol was approved 
by the local ethics committee and all patients gave written 
consent before being enrolled in the study. The inclusion 
criteria were: 
• a diagnosis of idiopathic PD according to the UKPDBB 
criteria and a Hoehn & Yahr scale score ≤ 3 [18, 19]; 
the presence of single- or multiple-domain PD-MCI [20]; 
• 
• age between 50 and 85 years; 
• educational level ≥ 5 years. 





• concomitant severe non-neurological comorbidities (e.g. 
cardiovascular, metabolic and/or endocrinological dis- 
eases); 

with the intervention; 
• deep brain stimulation. 
All patients were treated with dopamine agonists or 
L-DOPA and had been on a stable therapeutic regimen for 
at least 3 months. No changes in medication were allowed 
during the training and follow-up period. In accordance with 
the Movement Disorder Society Task Force guidelines (level 
II criteria) [20], the PD-MCI diagnosis was formulated on 
the basis of a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation 
designed to assess, using the instruments listed below, the 
following five cognitive domains: 
1. global cognition: Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) and Montreal Overall Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA) [21, 22]; 
2. episodic long-term memory: Logical Memory Test, 
immediate and delayed recall [23, 24], Rey’s 15 word 
test, immediate and delayed recall [25], and Rey Com- 
plex Figure, delayed recall [26]; 
logical-executive functions: Raven’s Matrices 1947 [25], 
the Frontal Assessment Battery [27], semantic fluency 
[28], phonological fluency [25], and Rey Complex Fig- 
ure, copy [26]; 





Patients with idiopathic PD were recruited (March 
2017–December 2019) from the Neurorehabilitation Unit 
At post-intervention (T1), we used the same neuropsy- 
chological battery; parallel versions were applied when 
available. All the raw scores were adjusted for age, sex, and 

 

education, and compared with the values available for the 
Italian population; the adjusted scores were then transformed 
into equivalent scores [30]. 
At baseline (T0), we also assessed mood using the Beck 
Depression Inventory (BDI) [31], functional status using the 
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL) [32], 
and cognitive reserve using the Cognitive Reserve Index 
questionnaire (CRIq) [33]. 

This study is a prospective double-blind 3-arm RCT. All 
PD-MCI patients recruited underwent T0 assessment per- 
formed using the above-listed tests. Patients who met the 
inclusion criteria were enrolled and randomized to one of 
three groups: CCT, PCT, or CG. For the patient allocation, 
we generated random numbers from a uniform distribution 
in the range 0–1, dividing the range in three equal intervals 
and assigning each patient to the group corresponding to 
the sampled number. In all groups, the intervention took 
place in the Neuropsychology Lab and lasted 3 weeks (4 
face-to-face individual sessions/week, each lasting 45 min). 
Cognitive outcomes were measured at T0 and T1 by a neu- 
ropsychologist who was blinded to the patient allocation. 
Further follow-ups will be conducted by December 2020. 
All neuropsychological assessments and training sessions 
were administered exclusively during “on” status. 

CoRe (acronym for cognitive rehabilitation) is a software 
tool developed within a research project. The extended 
version of CoRe (with respect to [4]) used in the present 
study administers 11 tasks targeting several cognitive abili- 
ties (e.g., logical-executive functions, attention/processing 
speed, working memory, and episodic memory; for details 
see Online Resource 1). Most of these tasks are computer- 
ized versions of existing paper-and-pencil exercises. Oth- 
ers were created to meet specific requirements expressed by 
the therapists and to exploit computer functionalities that 
would be particularly difficult to reproduce with a paper- 
and-pencil approach. During the dynamic generation of the 
exercises, the individual patient’s performance data (accu- 
racy and number of clues required) were analyzed to set 
the appropriate difficulty level. For each exercise and each 
level, thresholds are defined so as to allow difficulty levels 
to be progressively increased. Moreover, CoRe computed a 
performance indicator, the weighted score (WS) [16], which 
was calculated taking into account different parameters: type 
of exercise, difficulty level, accuracy, response time. The 
WS, used to assess both the overall outcome of a session and 
the global trend of the rehabilitation, served to summarize 
each patient’s performance in a single value. 
The PCT group followed the same training program as the 
CCT group, but using the paper-and-pencil version of the 
tasks. Computer tasks not reproducible in the context of the 
PCT approach were substituted by equivalent tasks training 
the same skills. In PCT, the dynamic aspect of the training 
(i.e. the increasing levels of difficulty) was managed by the 
therapist (who spent around 4 h/patient on preparation of 
appropriate PCT material). 
The CG subjects did unstructured activities (e.g., reading 
magazines, chatting, drawing) that served as a behavioral 
placebo treatment. 

The primary outcome measure was global cognitive func- 
tioning assessed using the MoCA, while the secondary 
outcome measures were performances in the five cognitive 
domains. To obtain a score for each domain, we calculated, 
in each group, the sum of the equivalent scores of all the 
tests and then divided the total by the number of tests. The 
sample size was based on the primary outcome. A power 
analysis indicated that a total sample size of 39 patients 
would be sufficient to detect an effect size of 0.3, with 90% 
power at 5% level of statistical significance. The data were 
analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle and 
including only those of participants who completed the 
study. Considering the small sample size, normality tests 
could not be expected to give reliable results, so non-par- 
ametric tests were preferred. The Kruskal–Wallis test was 
used for inter-group comparisons of participant character- 
istics and training gains (i.e., T1 minus T0). Significant dif- 
ferences were then evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed- 
rank test, which was also used for intra-group comparisons 
between T0 and T1. An effect size index (Cohen’s d) was 
calculated to measure the magnitude of the training effect 
for each significant difference within each group. The Wil- 
coxon signed-rank test was also used within the CCT group 
to evaluate changes in the WS from session 1 to session 12. 
Finally, Spearman’s correlations were used to detect associa- 
tions between individual characteristics and training gains 
in global cognitive functioning, as reflected in the MoCA 
score, our primary outcome measure. To this end, only the 
CCT and PCT groups were considered, given that the CG 
did no structured activity. All statistical analyses were per- 
formed using SPSS software ver. 23.0. 

Fifty-three PD patients were enrolled. Of these, 21 were ran- 
domly assigned to CCT, 14 to PCT, and 18 to CG activities. 
In the CCT and PCT groups, 3 and 2 patients, respectively, 
dropped out because they were discharged before the end

of the intervention (CONSORT diagram in Fig. 1). The 
CCT and PCT groups, thus, comprised 18 and 12 patients, 
respectively. 
Demographic and clinical characteristics at T0 are 
reported in Table 1. No baseline difference was found 
between the three groups: age (χ2 = 4.68, p = 0.10, df = 2), 
education (χ2 = 1.90, p = 0.38, df = 2), gender (χ 2 = 1.04, 
p = 0.59, df = 2), disease duration (χ 2 = 4.52, p = 0.10, 
df = 2), UPDRS III (χ 2 = 0.67, p = 0.72, df = 2), IADL 
(χ2 = 0.71, p = 0.70, df = 2), cognitive reserve (χ2 = 0.56, 
p = 0.76, df = 2), MMSE (χ2 = 0.20, p = 0.91, df = 2), MoCA 
(χ2 = 1.35, p = 0.51, df = 2). The only exception was BDI 
(χ2 = 11.13, p = 0.004, df = 2); the CG had significantly 
lower scores than the CCT (Z = 2.617, p = 0.009) and PCT 
(Z = 2.964, p = 0.003) groups, whose scores were similar 
(Z = 1.634, p = 0.10). 
Analysis of T0 data was carried out on mean performance 
scores for the five cognitive domains considered. Internal 
consistency for these domains (Cronbach’s α) was moder- 
ate, probably due to the multifaceted complexity of each 
ability: global cognition (α = 0.54), episodic long-term 
memory (α = 0.47), logical-executive functions (α = 0.51), 
working memory (α = 0.69), and attention/processing speed 
(α = 0.58). No baseline differences were found between 
groups: global cognition (χ2 = 2.38, p = 0.31, df = 2), epi- 
sodic long-term memory (χ2 = 3.50, p = 0.17, df = 2), logi- 
cal-executive functions (χ2 = 4.99, p = 0.08, df = 2), working 
memory (χ2 = 3.59, p = 0.17, df = 2), and attention/process- 
ing speed (χ2 = 1.99, p = 0.37, df = 2).

No significant differences were found in the episodic long- 
term memory or working memory domains. 
The PCT group showed no significant differences 
between T0 and T1 in any of the domains, and the same 
stable pattern was also found in the CG. 











































The analysis of training gains is reported in Table 4 (see 
Online Resource 2 for corresponding means and standard 
deviations). 
The three groups differed significantly in the MoCA, 
global cognition, and attention/processing speed domains. 
The CCT group, compared with the PCT patients, recorded 
significantly better MoCA and global cognition domain per- 
formances, whereas they showed similar training gains in 
the other domains. Compared with the CG, the CCT group 
recorded greater training gains on the MoCA and global 
cognition and attention/processing speed. These pairs of 
groups showed similar training gains in episodic long-term 
memory, logical-executive functions, and working memory. 
When comparing the PCT group and the CG, no significant 
differences emerged, with the exception of attention/process- 
ing speed, where the PCT patients did better than the CG. 
With regard to the WS, computed by the CoRe software, 
the CCT group showed a significant improvement from ses- 
sion 1 to session 12 (Z = 3.724, p < 0.001) (see Fig. 4). 
On analysis of possible correlations between individual 
patient characteristics and training gains, MoCA gains cor- 
related negatively with baseline performance (r = − 0.54,

p = 0.004), whereas no associations were found for the other 
variables (age: r = − 0.25, p = 0.19; education: r = − 0.10, 
p = 0.60; disease duration: r = − 0.14, p = 0.52; UPDRS III: 
r = − 0.26, p = 0.24; IADL: r = 0.14, p = 0.47; BDI: r = 0.07, 
p = 0.73; cognitive reserve: r = − 0.06, p = 0.78). 

Our results showed positive effects of CCT compared with 
other interventions. On within-group analysis, the CCT 
patients showed medium/large effect size changes from T0 
to T1 both in global cognitive functioning (MoCA score), 
which was our primary outcome measure, and in some sec- 
ondary outcomes. No significant improvement was observed 
in the PCT or CG patients. Furthermore, the between-group 
analysis confirmed that the CCT-induced improvements 
were statistically different from the trends recorded in the 
other groups. In particular, the CCT patients had signifi- 
cantly larger training gains than the PCT ones on the MoCA 
and in the global cognition domain. When compared with 
the CG intervention, CCT induced significantly larger gains 
on the MoCA, and in the global cognition and attention/pro- 
cessing speed domains. On the other hand, the comparison 
of the PCT with the CG results confirmed the importance of 
structured cognitive activities with respect to unstructured 
ones, given that PCT was associated with significantly larger 
training gains in the attention/processing speed domain. 
Since our neuropsychological assessments included tests 
that were not part of the training activities, our results may 
reflect training-related effects rather than consequences of 
simple practice. With regard to the neuropsychological test, 
we used as the primary outcome, it is worth remarking that 
the MoCA is considered the most appropriate screening test 
for detecting global cognitive functioning in PD [34]. Some 
authors used the MMSE [35, 36], others the ACE-R [37, 
38]. In this research, we administered both the MMSE and 
the MoCA, which were considered as separate measures 
and also combined in a composite index of global cogni- 
tion. Our results showed an overall effect of CoRe on global 
cognitive level (both on the MoCA and on the composite 
index of global cognition), as also observed in [4]. It is 
noted that the baseline MoCA score in the CCT group was 
slightly, although not significantly, lower than that of the 
PCT group. The fact that the CCT also showed greater gains 
in other cognitive domains further reinforces the superior- 
ity of the computer-based training. Another consideration 
is that the CCT patients tended to have a shorter (albeit not 
significantly shorter) disease duration. It could, therefore, 
be argued that these patients might be more likely to show 
greater gains from cognitive training, independently of the 
treatment. However, the fact that disease duration was not 
found to correlate with training gains seems to confute this 
hypothesis. 
CoRe is a multi-domain training tool. Our analysis 
revealed training gains with large effect size mainly in the 
logical-executive functions and attention/processing speed 
domains, but less impact of the training on memory. In PD- 
MCI patients, executive functions are the most affected and 
probably the most sensitive to treatment effects. Further- 
more, different domains need different degrees of stimula- 
tion, in terms of duration and frequency. From this perspec- 
tive, it would be interesting to explore the effect of this CCT 
approach in other patients with different cognitive dysfunc- 
tion profiles. 
As for the influence of demographic/individual differ- 
ences [17], none of the variables considered correlated 
with training gains, except for a negative association with 
baseline cognitive status measured by MoCA. This is in line 
with the “compensation model”, which postulates that peo- 
ple with lower initial cognitive status tend to benefit more 
from the intervention because it allows them to compensate 
for their difficulties. In other words, participants with lower 
baseline performance and cognitive resources would have 
more room for improvement [39]. 
Our experience with CCT highlighted its multiple advan- 
tages, for therapists and patients, over traditional approaches. 
First, CCT allows more adaptive and patient-tailored train- 
ing. Second, it is time-saving for the therapist—the CCT 
tool was ready to use, whereas the therapists spent 20 min/ 
session per PCT patient on setting exercises, which amounts 
to about 48 h for just 12 patients. CoRe also records session 
parameters, whereas PCT per se does not allow recording 
of any session parameter. The time saved with CCT could 
be used to intensify the training sessions, or to provide more 
patients with treatment. Third, as CCT automatically records 
data, it offers the possibility of calculating a performance 
indicator (the WS) that summarizes the performance of a 
single patient or group. It is also worth noting the very high 
percentage of completed sessions, the good usability of the 
tool, and the patients’ confidence when using it, reported 
during the sessions. All these are points in favor of the sys- 
tem [16]. 
This study has some limitations. First, the number of 
patients randomized to the three groups was unbalanced. 
This is due to the relatively small total number of patients 
enrolled (n = 53). Randomized allocation of 53 cases to three 
groups is inherently very likely (the probability is around 
26%) to result in such an imbalance. Second, the study 
lacks follow-up assessments; therefore, we could not verify 
the retention of the effects of the treatment or the potential 
ability of CCT to delay conversion of PD-MCI into PD- 
dementia. Follow-up data are currently being collected and 
will be the topic of a future publication. Third, we observed 
selective drop-out in the CCT and PCT groups, due to the 

discharge of some patients before the end of the treatment. 
This might be considered a violation of the intention-to- 
treat principle, which may have biased the results. How- 
ever, these discharges were linked to routine clinical practice 
procedures or to personal reasons unrelated to the patients’ 
cognitive problems, and they were not due to the desire to 
discontinue the treatment. 
CoRe is currently a research tool, available for use by 
other health professionals with a view to sharing experi- 
ences. Cognitive training performed using the CoRe soft- 
ware could usefully be incorporated into routine clinical 
protocols as a non-pharmacological complementary ther- 
apy. With adequate adaptations, CoRe-based CCT could be 
repeated over time and also used remotely at home, thereby 
broadening its therapeutic potential and the number of 
beneficiaries.
