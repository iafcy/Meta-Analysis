Considering the high risk for individuals with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (A-MCI) to progress 
towards Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we investigated the efﬁcacy of a non-pharmacological intervention, 
that is, cognitive training that could reduce cognitive difﬁculties and delay the cognitive decline. For 
this, we evaluated the efﬁcacy of a 12-week computer-based memory-attention training program based 
on recognition in subjects with A-MCI and compared their performances with those of A-MCI controls 
trained in cognitively stimulating activities. The effect of training was assessed by comparing outcome 
measures in pre- and post-tests 15 days before and after training. To evaluate the duration of training 
beneﬁts, a follow-up test session was performed 6 months after memory and attention training or 
cognitively stimulating activities. 


Since the training program was exclusively based on recognition, our results showed a general- 
ization from recognition to recall processes, which are memory components that represent part of the 
core cognitive impairments in individuals at risk of converting to AD. Thus, cognitive training based 
on recognition holds promise as a preventive therapeutic method and could be proposed as a non- 
pharmacological early-intervention strategy. Future investigations need to focus on methodological 
constraints and delineating possible neuroplastic mechanisms of action. 



Cognitive enrichment early in life, as indicated by level of 
education, complexity of work environment, and nature of leisure 
activities, can promote better cognitive functioning that can be 
maintained into advanced age (Acevedo & Loewenstein, 2007; 
Brehmer et al., 2008). To combat age-related cognitive decline 
and prevent dementia, interventions based on increasing complex 
mental activity seem promising. Valenzuela and Sachdev (2006a, 
2006b) reported that individuals with higher levels of mental 
activity have a reduced rate of incident cognitive decline and are 
at only about half the risk of developing dementia. These effects 
reﬂect increased cognitive functioning, which depends on the 
ability of the brain to compensate for pathological changes 
associated with aging. This compensatory ability is referred to as 
cognitive reserve. The cognitive reserve hypothesis suggests that

cognitive enrichment promotes utilization of available functions 
(Christensen et al., 2008; Stern, 2009). The brain is malleable in 
response to one’s environment, and the central nervous system is 
continuously adjusting to environmental experiences. Beneﬁcial 
effects of environmental enrichment early in life have been 
observed in rodents and primates as structural correlates, which 
include more synapses in speciﬁc brain regions that lead to greater 
neuronal organization (for a review see Milgram, Siwak-Tapp, 
Araujo, & Head, 2006). 
Research on interventions based on augmenting complex mental 
activity postulates that cognitive training (CT) acts by stimulating 
neuroprotective mechanisms (Valenzuela & Sachdev, 2009), anchor- 
ing the theoretical foundation of CT in the concept of synaptic 
plasticity and cognitive reserve. Our previous works on rodents 
support this view. During entry to senescence (around 15 months 
old) or after cholinergic damage, rodents show a wide range 
of cognitive deﬁcits (McGaughy, Everitt, Robbins, & Sarter, 2000). 
We showed that housing in a long-term enriched environment 
had beneﬁcial effects on cognitive performance (Paban, Jaffard, 
Chambon, Malafosse, & Alescio-Lautier, 2005) and that this corre- 
lated with an upregulated gene expression of neurotrophic signaling

molecules in frontal cortex and hippocampus (Paban, Chambon, 
Manrique, Touzet, & Alescio-Lautier, 2011). Lambert, Fernandez, and 
Frick (2005) found that cognitive stimulation in mice increased 
synaptophysin levels in the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebel- 
lum. Electrophysiological measures of synaptic plasticity such as 
long-term potentiation are also increased (Artola et al., 2006). 
Interestingly, enrichment in transgenic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
mice has been associated with as much as 50% less amyloid 
pathology (Adlard, Perreau, Pop, & Cotman, 2005; Costa et al., 
2007). Studies in humans showed that CT in healthy older indivi- 
duals can increase levels of putatively neuroprotective metabolites 
in the hippocampus (Valenzuela et al., 2003) and increase frontal 
lobe metabolism (Small et al., 2006). It is unknown whether mental 
training can delay hippocampal atrophy in AD, but Valenzuela, 
Sachdev, Wen, Chen, and Brodaty (2008) reported that lifetime 
levels of mental activity are inversely correlated to the rate of 
hippocampal atrophy in healthy older adults. Thus, there is increas- 
ing evidence in humans and animals of the role of environmental 
and lifestyle factors as moderators in cognitive aging and as 
protective agents for the development of AD. Given the involvement 
of such factors in the outcome of aging, it is reasonable to assume 
that cognitive intervention and particularly CT may play a role in 
normal aging and AD. 
Persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) retain a large 
range of cognitive capacities and plasticity (Calero & Navarro, 
2004), which makes them ideal for studying CT and its underlying 
mechanisms. Moreover, CT might serve in persons with MCI who 
are at risk of developing AD or other types of dementia. 
To date, however, few studies have been conducted on CT and 
MCI. Memory strategies training resulted in limited improvement 
on objective memory and cognitive function (Rapp, Brenes, & 
Marsh, 2002; Troyer, Murphy, Anderson, Moscovitch, & Craik, 
2008), suggesting that impaired memory function may be resistant 
to the beneﬁts of a unimodal memory intervention. In contrast, 
multidomain CT in MCI showed positive effects on cognitive 
abilities and on mood and behavioral disturbances (Barnes et al., 
2009; Cipriani, Bianchetti, & Trabucchi, 2006; Galante, Venturini, 
& Fiaccadori, 2007; Gunter, Schafer, Holzner, & Kemmler, 2003; 
Rozzini et al., 2007; Talassi, Guerreschi, Feriani, & Fedi, 2007). 
Traditional pen-and-pencil CT exercises are progressively being 
replaced by computer-based programs, which are superior in many 
ways. The computer facilitates multimodal and multidomain 
training, which seems to be a key factor for functional efﬁcacy, 
and provides for individualized intervention, by gradually increas- 
ing task difﬁculty in a customized fashion. These features allow 
effective control of ceiling and ﬂoor effects, both important for 
successful cognitive exercise because individuals are continually 
cognitively challenged. 
The speciﬁc goal of the present study was to develop, for subjects 
with MCI, a computer-CT program based on memory functions 
known to be deﬁcient with the advance of AD but still preserved 
or slightly impaired in MCI, and then to conduct a pilot study to 
evaluate this program on episodic recognition and retrieval pro- 
cesses. The underlying hypothesis was that regular practice with 
speciﬁc tasks would strengthen the functioning of the targeted 
cognitive mechanisms, which are still relatively preserved, but 
vulnerable to AD. For this, we focused on median temporal lobe 
areas, which are vulnerable to early-stage AD (Braak & Braak, 1991; 
Delacourte et al., 1999) and developed training exercises to stimu- 
late these areas. Based on the reported neuroprotective effects of CT 
(Valenzuela et al., 2003) and on the demonstration that neuroplas- 
ticity exists in persons with MCI (Calero & Navarro, 2004), we 
postulated that the stimulation of the brain regions vulnerable to 
early-stage AD could generate neuroprotective effects by stimulating 
residual neuroplastic pathways, reduce cognitive difﬁculties, and 
delay the cognitive decline. 


Twenty-two subjects with amnestic MCI multiple domains subtype (A-MCImd) 
referring to the Behavioral Neurology Department of Sainte-Marguerite Hospital, 
(Marseille, France) were selected. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) 65–90 years of 
age and (ii) meet deﬁnition criteria for A-MCI-md (Petersen, 2004). All patients had 
memory complaint, usually veriﬁed by an informant. Memory performances and 
those in one or more other cognitive domains (i.e. attention or executive domain) 
were below the normative data (see subsequent section for the description of 
neuropsychological tests). The cut-off scores for abnormality were 1.5 SD below the 
mean score for the corresponding age and education group, (iii) have normal general 
cognitive functioning as determined by a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 
(Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) scoreZ24, and (iv) a global clinical dementia 
rating scale (Hugues, Berg, Danzinger, Coben, & Martin, 1982) score of 0.5. Exclusion 
criteria were (i) neurological, psychiatric, or medical disorders, (ii) moderate or severe 
depression as determined by a score411 (moderate depression) or419 (severe 
depression) on the Geriatric Depression Scale (Yesavage et al., 1983), (iii) relevant 
hearing, vision, motor or language deﬁcits, and (iv) recent participation in cognitive 
stimulation/training. 
All patients underwent a CT scan and routine biological screening. Activities 
of daily living were normal, as assessed through the Instrumental Activities of 
Daily Living (IADL, Barberger-Gateau et al., 1992). All patients underwent standard 
neuropsychological assessment. The neuropsychological battery assessed memory, 
attention, and executive skills. It included the following tests: The Rey Auditory 
Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT, Spreen & Strauss, 1998), the 16-item free and cued 
reminding test (RL/RI-16 test, Van der Linden et al., 2004), the copy and recall of the 
Rey Figure (Rey, 1959), the MMSE, the forward and backward digit span, the Trail 
Making Test (TMT, Reitan, 1958), Zazzo’s cancellation test (Zazzo, 1974), Stroop test 
(Golden, 1978), the semantic (animals) and phonemic (letter P) verbal ﬂuency test 
(Cardebat et al., 1990), the dual-task test of Baddeley (Baddeley et al., 1997), and 
the DO-80 naming test (Deloche et al., 1997). Behavioral assessment included the 
30-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS, Yesavage et al., 1983). 
The 22 patients were randomly assigned into two groups (11 patients per 
group): a group that performed training (Trained group) and a group that 
participated in stimulating cognitive activities (Control group). Baseline demo- 
graphic data are summarized in Table 1. 
This study was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki and the 
study was approved by the hospital research Ethics Committee. All patients 
provided written informed consent prior to participation. 



2.2.1.1. Theoretical foundations. Because MCI individuals have mainly episodic mem- 
ory deﬁcits and their recognition memory mechanisms are at least relatively intact, 
our CT program used a familiarity-based forced-choice recognition procedure. Neu- 
ropsychological studies on A-MCI patients reported prominent deﬁcits in episodic 
memory, characterized by impaired encoding and storage capacities in recall (for 
review, see Belleville, Sylvain-Roy, de Boysson, & Me´ nard, 2008), a pattern that is also 
characteristic in AD (for a review, see Lekeu & Van der Linden, 2005). These memory 
impairments are also reported for recognition (Alescio-Lautier et al., 2007; Dudas, 
Clague, Thompson, Graham, & Hodges, 2005; Perri, Carlesimo, Serra, Caltagirone, and 
the Early Diagnosis Group of the Italian Interdisciplinary Network on Alzheimer’s 
Disease 2005), which involves recollection and familiarity processes. Other A-MCI 
studies revealed a signiﬁcant deﬁcit in recollection-based recognition but a selective 
preservation of familiarity-based recognition (Anderson et al., 2008; Serra et al., 2010; 
Westerberg, Paller, Mayes, Holdstock, & Reber, 2006). 
Short-term memory is impaired in AD. In A-MCI-md, this deﬁcit appears as 
increasing time between the encoding and recognition phase (Gagnon & Belleville, 
2011), reﬂecting a difﬁculty in maintaining information, which consequently affects 
working memory. Subjects with A-MCI-md have preserved immediate memory and 
memory for short delays. To improve information maintenance during working

memory, training was based on increasing the maintenance time. For this, we gradually 
increased the blank interval between memorization and recognition. This technique is 
used in the spaced retrieval method (Laudauer & Bjork, 1978), which is efﬁcient for 
patients with mild AD (Camp & Stevens, 1990; Erk(cid:2)es, Raffard, & Meulemans, 2010). 
Because short- and long-term memory processes share similar neural mechanisms 
(Marklund et al., 2007; Nee & Jonides, 2011), we hypothesized that short-term memory 
training would help maintain information in long-term memory. 
Based on the notion that remediation is better if participants are prevented from 
reinforcing their own errors, we endorse the deﬁnition of ‘‘error reduction’’ proposed 
by Fillingham, Hodgson, Sage, and Lambon-Ralph (2003). In this context, before and 
during training exercise, we used a procedure that reduces errors. Prior to training, the 
subjects were invited to perform a guided procedure that forced them to provide a 
good answer. This guided procedure was repeated until the subjects had acquired the 
automatisms to properly perform the task. Then, during training we used an approach 
whereby the task was manipulated to reduce incorrect responses. Subjects began with 
very easy discrimination, and task difﬁculty was increased gradually by the neurop- 
sychologist (for more details see procedure section below). 
We also focused on the practical implementation of mnemonic strategies, for 
example naming, repetition, categorization, or association. Indeed, MCI individuals 
may beneﬁt from intervention programs to optimize their functioning through the 
use of cognitive and memory strategies (Belleville, 2008; Belleville et al., 2006). 
The CT program incorporates, in addition to memory training, training of focused and 
divided attention and processing speed. In fact, besides memory deﬁcits, A-MCI-md 
patients exhibit attentional deﬁcits, particularly in attentional focus (Levinoff, Saumier, 
& Chertkow, 2005; Tales, Snowden, Haworth, & Wilcock, 2005), divided attention and 
attentional control (Belleville, Chertkow, & Gauthier, 2007; Danhausser et al., 2005), 
and/or speed of processing (Gorus, De Raedt, Lambert, Lemper, & Mets, 2008; Levinoff 
et al., 2005). Memory and attention are highly interactive and interdependent 
processes, due to their functional association and their shared circuitry. Attention is 
composed of hierarchical sub-components. High in the attention taxonomy are 
complex attention abilities such as working memory, divided attention, and the ability 
to shift attention between different tasks (Sturm, Willmes, Orgass, & Hartje, 1997). To 
enhance attention performances throughout training, we repeatedly administered 
several attentional tasks in a hierarchy based on the model of Van Zomeren and 
Brouwer (1994), which highlights areas of strength and selectivity of attention. 
2.2.1.2. Training exercises. Training exercises were programmed in Java (Release 1.4) 
and conducted on a Microsoft Windows-based computer with a 12-in. tactile screen 
and a resolution of 1.024 (cid:2) 768 pixels. The stimuli were pictures belonging to various 
categories (e.g., animals, ﬂowers, objects of everyday life) and common words prono- 
unced by the computer. Each picture was 256 (cid:2) 256 pixels in size. Responses to trai- 
ning tasks were given using a tactile screen, a standard keyboard (using only 2 keys), 
and a computer mouse. For attentional training, we used response time tasks to yes/no 
choice; for memory training, we used recognition memory tasks with forced choice. 

Visual recognition task (v-RM)—The task lasted ﬁve minutes. Participants started 
the exercise with a number of pictures to memorize that was adjusted according 
to their performance in a pre-training session. There were three variants. In 
variant 1 (V1), participants were asked to memorize pictures and recognize them 
immediately after their presentation among distractors. Participants had to 
respond by clicking on the recognized pictures. Variant 2 (V2) was identical to 
V1 but memorization and recognition were separated by a blank interval of 10, 
20, or 30 s. Variant 3 (V3) was identical to V2 but a distractor (multiple-choice- 
questionnaire based on semantic knowledge) was introduced during the interval 
(10, 20, or 30 s). We determined the percentage of correct responses. 
Visuospatial recognition task (vs-RM)—The task lasted ﬁve minutes. Partici- 
pants started the exercise with a number of pictures to memorize that was 
adjusted according to their performance in a pre-training session. There were 
three variants. In variant 1(V1), participants had to memorize the position of 
identical pictures and recognize this layout among two proposals: one was the 
layout and the other not. Participants had to respond by clicking on the model. 
Variant 2 (V2) was identical to V1 but memorization and recognition were 
separated by a blank interval of 10, 20, or 30 s. Variant 3 was identical to V2 
but the multiple-choice-questionnaire distractor was introduced during the 
interval (10, 20, or 30 s). We determined the percentage of correct responses. 
Visual recognition Working Memory Training Task (v-RWM)—This task lasted ﬁve 
minutes. At the beginning of the task, participants had to memorize one 
picture and, in the next trial, they were asked to memorize a novel picture and 
then to click on the old picture. In the next trial, the new pictures became the 
old pictures. This procedure was repeated throughout the task. We deter- 
mined the percentage of correct responses. 
one after the other in the middle of the screen. Participants had to press on a key: 
‘‘enter’’ for yes, it is the target, and ‘‘esc’’ for no, it is not the target. Participants 
were instructed to respond as fast and as accurately as possible. Variant 2 (V2) was 
identical to V1 but pictures (50% distractor, 50% target) also appeared in the 
periphery of the screen. Participants were instructed to ignore these pictures, even 
if it was the target picture. Variant 3 (V3) was identical to V1 but the target was a 
category, i.e. animals. We determined the percentage of correct responses and the 
response time (s). 
Visuospatial Focused Attention Task (vs-FA)—The task lasted three minutes. There 
were three variants. In variant 1(V1), pictures (50% distractor, 50% target) 
appeared one after the other on the left or the right of the screen. Participants 
had to press a key: ‘‘enter’’ for yes, it is the target, and ‘‘esc’’ for no, it is not the 
target. They were instructed to respond as fast and as accurately as possible. In 
variant 2 (V2), two pictures appeared at the same time, one of which was 
pointed to by an arrow. The participants had to respond if the picture pointed to 
by the arrow was the target picture or not. They were instructed to ignore 
pictures that were not pointed to by the arrow even if it was the target picture. 
We determined the percentage of correct responses and the response time (s). 
Divided attention task—The task was limited to six trials. Variant 1 (V1) consisted 
in concurrently performing one auditory short-term memory task (words 
pronounced by the computer) and V1 of the v-FA task. The recognition test took 
place after the dual-task. The subject had to recognize pictures that corresponded 
to the words heard among distractors. Variant 2 (V2) was identical to V1 but with 
V2 of the v-FA task. Variant 3 (V3) was identical to V1 but with V3 of the v-FA 
task. We determined the percentage of correct responses for the auditory short 
term memory task and the percentage of correct responses and the response time 
(s) for the visual focus attention task. Modulated parameters and cognitive 
processes trained by each task are given in Table 2. 

Patients assigned to the control group were administered cognitive activities 
consisting of exercises in which they were asked to ﬁnd names of countries and 
corresponding capitals, organize a list of purchases in categories, ﬁnd similarities 
and differences, choose a newspaper article and bar all the letters ‘‘A’’, read a text 
and then answer questions, or tell a story or construct a sentence from a list of 
words in disorder, etc. All control patients performed the same sets of activities 
sessions. For training sessions, the control group was assigned the same number, 
frequency, and duration of cognitive activities sessions as the trained group. 

Training or cognitive activities sessions were supervised by a trained neurop- 
sychologist who gave the instructions and managed the execution time for each 
activity. Each session had the same structure including 1—a welcome and a 
reminder of what had been done at the previous session, 2—training with two 
cognitive exercises or two cognitively stimulating activities, 3—teaching of 
memory strategies that can be applied in daily demanding memory situations 
(e.g., store the objects in the same place, take notes, etc.), 4—information on the 
cognitive functioning and on the effects of aging on cognitive functioning, and 
5—a conclusion with feedback on performances or activities session. 
Training consisted of 24 sessions of approximately 1 h that involved a memory 
task and an attention task (detailed presentation in Table 3). Both memory and 
attention tasks were performed using the following schedule: (a) read general 
information: participants read information about trained memory or attention process, 
e.g., deﬁnitions, examples in everyday life; (b) read the instructions for the task to 
perform; (c) view an example of the task: subjects performed some trials in which no 
mistake is possible, (d) practice the task: participants performed some trials of the task 
and were informed when they made a mistake. This step is based on trial and error 
learning technique, and (e) perform the task: participants performed the task and were 
informed at the end about their performance. Training was individualized for each 
patient by the neuropsychologist who had the opportunity to increase or decrease the 
difﬁculty of each task by modulating parameters such as the duration of image 
presentation, the number of pictures or words to remember, the choice of the target, or 
the addition of a distractor. These parameters were adjusted by the neuropsychologist 
at the phases ‘‘view an example of the task’’ and ‘‘practice the task’’. As patients 
improved across sessions, these parameters were manipulated so that the tasks would 
continue to challenge their abilities but without putting them in distress because they 
failed. Because of the adjustment of the level of exigency and complexity of the training 
according to the skills of the patients and their progress during training, the 
performances were never inferior to 70% and the feedback was always positive. 


Visual Focused Attention Task (v-FA)—The task lasted three minutes. There were 
three variants. In variant 1 (V1), participants had to concentrate on the middle of 
the screen to detect a target picture. Pictures (50% distractor, 50% target) appeared 
Outcome measures included neuropsychological tests investigating verbal and 
visual memory. Verbal memory was assessed by the forward and the backward digit- 
span test, the 12-word-list recall test from the BEM-144 memory battery (Signoret, 
1991), the 16-item free and cued reminding test (16-FR/CR test) (Van der Linden et al., 
2004), and the subscore recall of the MMSE. Visual memory was assessed by the visual 
recognition subtest from the Doors and People memory battery (Baddeley, Emslie, &

Modulated parameters and cognitive processes trained for each task. Two types of modulated parameters can be distinguished: those that were invariant and 
distinguished the variants of a task, and those that varied between subjects for a variant. Thus, throughout training, parameters were adjusted to the cognitive level of the 
patients. For memory exercises, the variation of (i) the number of pictures permitted us to act on memory load according to the attentional cost of the task, (ii) the number 
of distractors played a key role in the resistance to interference, (iii) the duration of model presentation acted on the speed and the quality of information processing, and 
(iv) the time interval promoted information maintenance. For attention exercises, the choice of the target pictures served to modulate the similarity between the target 
and the distractors in order to favor information processes training tasks Modulated parameters Trained cognitive processes.

All participants attended 24 individual 60-min sessions of training, 2 times per 
week for 12 weeks. The training and cognitive activities sessions took place in our 
laboratory. The effect of training and cognitive activities was assessed by 
comparing outcome measures in pre- and post-tests 15 days before (t0) and after 
(t1) training. To evaluate the maintenance of training beneﬁts over time, a follow- 
up test session (t2) was performed 6 months after training or cognitive activities. 
Three trained neuropsychologists were involved in the study: one administered 
and scored the pre-tests, post-tests, and follow-up tests (this person was kept 
blind to the group membership of patients), one supervised training, and 
one supervised cognitive activities. Parallel versions were used at post-test and 
follow-up test for the 12-word-list recall test, the 16-item free and cued reminding 
test, and the MMSE (the list of words differed and semantic categories changed).

Organization of training. Training consisted of 24 training sessions. Memory and 
attention processes were concurrently stimulated. Each session included an 
attention task, either visual focused attention (v-FA), visuospatial focus attention 
(vs-FA), or divided attention (DA), and a memory task, either visual recognition 
memory (v-RM), visuospatial recognition memory (vs-RM), or visual recognition 
working memory (v-RWM). Training of memory promoted stimulation of visual 
and visuospatial modalities alternatively by using an adaptation of the spaced 
retrieval method. During these exercises, patients were encouraged to use 
mnemonic strategies like verbalization, association of ideas, and mental imagery. 
Training of attention was based on a speciﬁc approach that considered the sub- 
components of attention as being distinct, hierarchical, and independent. In this 
context, the hierarchical order was based on the theoretical model of Van Zomeren 
and Brouwer (1994), highlighting the intensity and selectivity axes of attention. 
With regard to the selectivity axis, we articulated our training on selective 
attention, divided attention, and working memory. For each hierarchical step of 
the selectivity axis, hierarchical steps of the intensity axis were embedded, i.e. 
alertness, vigilance, and sustained attention. Such hierarchies have been success- 
fully used by Sturm et al. (1997) in the training of attention only. For the training 
of memory and attention components, the levels of exigencies and complexity 
were constantly adapted to the patients’ progress during training. The advantage 
of using this procedure was suggested by Strache (1987) and was highlighted in 
the work of Sturm et al. (1997).

putting them in distress or causing them to fail. Examples of the 
evolution of the parameters manipulated are illustrated in Fig. 1A. 
The number of pictures to memorize during the training of the 
visual recognition task increased for V1, V2, and V3 (Fig. 1A1) for 
training performances (% of correct responses) between 85 % and 
95% (data not shown). Similarly, the number of distractors in 
the recognition test increased (Fig. 1A2) for V1, V2, and V3 for the 
same range of performance. In the same way, the number of 
words memorized during the training of auditory memory 
increased in both the single (Fig. 1A3) and dual task situation 
(Fig. 1A4) for training performances (% of correct responses) 
respectively between 100% and 90–96% (data not shown). These 
data show that patients with MCI are able to maintain a high level 
of performance despite the increased mental load. Thus, partici- 
pants improved their memory abilities during training. 
Recall that to customize training, parameters were speciﬁcally 
adjusted to the cognitive level of the patient. Consequently, the 
evolution of training performances lies in a narrow range, and a 
stabilized performance should be interpreted as an improvement 
of the cognitive component trained since the complexity of 
the training was gradually adjusted according to the skills of 
the patients and their progress. An example is provided with the 
training of focalized attention. Performances are illustrated in 
Fig. 1B. In this task, we asked the subjects to respond as quickly as 
possible: yes, it is the target, or no, it is not the target. Since the 
subjects had to respond correctly and quickly, training consisted in 
ﬁnding a compromise between response accuracy, indicated by the 
percentage of correct responses (respectively for the visual and the 
visuospatial focalized attention: Figs. 1B1 and 1B2), and the speed at 
indicated by the response times 
which the subject answered, 
(respectively for the visual and the visuospatial focalized attention: 
Figs. 1B3 and 1B4). Repeated measures ANOVA on the percentage of 
correct response for the visual focalized attention showed a sig-

post-hoc Newman–Keuls t-test (po0.05) indicated that training 
performances on sessions 17, 21, and 22 differed from those on 
sessions 12 and 13. 
Correlation analyses showed a signiﬁcant negative correlation 
between the percentage of correct responses and response times 
whatever the modality (visual vs. visuospatial) and the variant 
considered, V1–V3 (r¼ (cid:3) 0.465, p¼0.005; r¼ (cid:3) 0.377, p¼0.029; 
r¼ (cid:3) 0.423, p¼0.013 respectively from variants 1–3 of the visual 
focused attention task and r¼ (cid:3) 0.470, p¼0.005; r¼ (cid:3) 0.759, 
p¼0.0001 respectively for variants 1 and 2 of the visuospatial 
focused attention task). Thus, as the percentage of correct 
responses increased, the response times decreased, suggesting 
improved attentional focus and processing speed over training. 
Participants improved in all training tasks except for the 
visuospatial recognition memory task, which failed to train this 
modality of memory. For this task, it seems that training was too 
short to achieve positive results. 

Results are presented in Table 4. At pre-test (t0), the two groups 
did not differ signiﬁcantly in memory neuropsychological test scores 
(see Table 4, t0 column; Newman–Keuls t-test, po0.05).

training had a strong effect on recognition. However, this effect

that the number of cued recalled words was similar for the two

free recall than in free recall, since performances were still enhanced 
at t2 in delayed free recall (Fig. 2A) for the trained group, but not in 
total free recall. Then, to assess whether there was any performance 
gain between the last free recall and delayed free recall, a repeated 
measures ANOVA was performed on the third free recall and the 
delayed free recall for t1 and t2 (Fig. 2A). For t1, the analysis showed

performed worse on delayed free recall than on the third free recall 
whereas the trained group maintained its performance. For t2, 
statistical analysis did not reach signiﬁcance, due to the increased 
variability in the training group. 
The recall of the three words of the MMSE (Table 4) was improved 
in the trained group (group effect [F(1, 20)¼7.646, p¼0.012;

hoc Newman–Keuls t-test (po0.05) showed that the trained group 
performed better than the control group at both t1 and t2. 
No effect was found for the recall of Rey–Osterrieth Complex 
Figure, suggesting that our training did not have any effect on 
visuoconstruction abilities. 

Our study revealed a positive effect of a computer-based 
memory and attention training program in subjects with A-MCImd. 
Interestingly, although only recognition was trained, both recogni- 
tion and recall processes were improved, indicating a transfer of the 
training beneﬁts between different mechanisms, recognition vs 
recall. This promising result may serve to delay cognitive decline 
in the pre-clinical stage of AD since recall is one of the core 
cognitive impairments. In this line, Rozzini et al. (2007) showed 
that CT combined with anticholinesterase inhibitor therapy induced 
more cognitive beneﬁts than pharmacological treatment alone. 
Thus, the effect of training may be potentiated by the combination 
of a non-medicinal treatment and medication. This combination 
could be promising for preventing dementia. Surprisingly, despite 
the challenge, few studies have been conducted on the effect of 
CT in MCI subjects at risk of developing AD. Training of memory 
only has resulted in limited improvement (Troyer et al., 2008). 
In contrast, multidomain computer-based CT can signiﬁcantly 
improve most cognitive functions, e.g., learning (G ¨unther, Sch¨afer, 
Holzner, & Kemmler, 2003), behavioral memory (Cipriani et al., 
2006), episodic memory and abstract reasoning (Rozzini et al., 
2007), and long-term visual spatial memory (Talassi et al., 2007). 
However, these studies used a combination of several interven- 
tional approaches, which makes interpretation of results and 
comparison between studies difﬁcult. 

In the present study, the increased scores on neuropsycholo- 
gical tests assessing recognition might be expected since the CT 
program was exclusively based on recognition. However, note 
that according to dual processes models, recognition memory is 
supported by the dissociable processes of recollection and famil- 
iarity. Familiarity is thought to be spared in normal aging whereas 
recollection is not. The rare studies on this subject in patients 
with AD suggest the impairment of memory is due to deﬁcits in 
both recollection and familiarity (Smith & Knight, 2002). Studies 
on A-MCI reported an impairment of recollection processes (Serra 
et al, 2010). Regarding familiarity, the data are conﬂicting. Some 
reported a preservation of familiarity (Anderson et al., 2008; 
Serra et al., 2010; Westerberg et al., 2006), while others reported 
an impairment (Ally, Gold, & Budson, 2009; Wolk, Signoff, & 
Dekosky, 2008). We previously showed that impairment of 
familiarity could depend on the nature of the modality tested 
i.e. visual or visuospatial (Alescio-Lautier et al., 2007). It has been 
suggested that the impairment of familiarity depends on the MCI 
subtype. Indeed, deﬁcits were reported in A-MCImd (Ally et al., 
2009; Wolk et al., 2008) but not in A-MCI single domain 
(Anderson et al., 2008; Serra et al., 2010). Since patients were 
A-MCImd in the current study, the positive effects we observed 
after CT based on familiarity forced-choice procedure suggest that 
there is still sufﬁcient cerebral plasticity linked to this process to 
allow training. 
Our results support the hypothesis of Westerberg et al. (2006) 
that enthorinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices are 
partially damaged but can nonetheless continue to support 
familiarity in A-MCI. Recent works suggested that sparing of 
familiarity is associated with a compensatory increase in peri- 
rhinal activity (Daselaar, Fleck, Dobbins, Madden, & Cabeza, 
2006). Thus, it is likely that the CT, which focused on familiarity, 
increased compensatory perirhinal activities and consequently 
enhanced A-MCImd patients’ performances. Particularly note that 
training using a familiarity procedure can enhance performance 
in a task that involves recollection. This was the case for set B of 
the Doors and People test. This set, in contrast to set A, could not 
be resolved on the basis of only familiarity. It also requires 
recollection processes (Holdstock, Gutnikov, Gaffan, & Mayes, 
2000). According to this assumption, the improved performance 
in set B showed that our recognition training procedure was able 
to promote better recognition even though it requires, in addition 
to familiarity, recollection processes. 
Attention training with the visual focused attentional tasks 
improved information processing, as shown by the decreased 
reaction time in the training tasks while the percentage of correct 
response increased (Fig. 1B1, B3). This effect was probably due to 
perceptual facilitation and better ability to detect details through- 
out the training. Thus, the increased recognition in set B of the 
Doors and People test in trained A-MCImd could also reﬂect 
better information extraction when similarity between target and 
distractors were increased. Indeed, set B is based on processing, 
which involves a large investment in attentional 
focus and 
selectivity and speed of information processing. Distractors are 
highly similar in color and form; to recognize the target door, one 
must be able to fully and promptly analyze the image.

cognitive impairment. Neuropsychologia (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.04.012 



Higher scores were found in the forward digit span test in 
trained MCI relative to controls. This effect could come from the 
progressive increase in CT of the number of pictures or words to 
memorize. In contrast, scores were not improved in the backward 
digit span test, which requires active memory processing in 
addition to immediate storage. We interpret this lack of improve- 
ment as an absence of transfer of the beneﬁts of training from 
recognition to recall when the task is in working memory. 

Recall processes were improved in trained MCI. Remember 
that the CT program was exclusively based on recognition. Since 
recall was not trained, there was a generalization from recogni- 
tion to recall processes. Interestingly, recall was improved for 
short- and long-term processes in trained A-MCImd. 
Improvement of short-term retrieval processes in trained 
A-MCImd was shown by the increased scores in free recall. This 
is likely due to a deeper encoding through various strategies such 
as verbalization and association of ideas. In contrast, the lack of 
enhancement of cued recall suggests that training acts more on 
encoding than on retrieval processes. 

long-term retrieval processes in trained 
A-MCI-md was shown by the increased scores in delayed recall 
of the 16-item free and cued reminding test. Note that CT was 
mainly based on short-term memory training. Thus, it is likely 
that the enhancement of delayed recall could be explained by the 
use of the spaced retrieval method (Laudauer & Bjork, 1978), which 
promoted the maintenance of information. Belleville et al. (2006) 
reported improved delayed free recall of lists of words after 2-month 
multifactorial cognitive training. In this case, training was conducted 
in groups and focused on teaching episodic memory strategies such 
as visual imagery abilities, face-name associations, method of loci, 
and verbal organization like categorization and hierarchization. Note 
that delayed free recall is improved after many types of interven- 
tions: group or individual training, and training based on memory 
strategies or recognition processes. Because of the differences 
between the training by Belleville et al. (2006) and our training, it 
is likely that the positive effect was sustained by different cognitive 
mechanisms and consequently by different cerebral substrates. 

We found that improved recognition or recall lasted at least 
6 months after training, suggesting a resistance to memory decline 
in A-MCI-md. This result supports the idea that CT could favor 
compensation mechanisms. However, note that memory perfor- 
mances become vulnerable in the absence of training, as shown by 
the increased variability in some scores. This leads us to think that, 
as the disease progresses, compensatory mechanisms established 
during training decline thereafter, resulting in lower cognitive 
performance. If patients do not sustain training, the transfer gains 
dissipate over time. This means that longer training could enhance 
or maintain training-related cognitive beneﬁts over time and could 
generate a greater resistance to cognitive decline in A-MCI-md 
patients. Few studies have evaluated the maintenance of training. 
Long-term studies in healthy older subjects suggested that the 
positive effect of training is enduring. Willis et al. (2006) reported 
positive functional beneﬁts at 5-year follow-up. Such long delays 
have not been tested in subjects with MCI. For this population, 
Rozzini et al. (2007) reported beneﬁts in episodic memory at 
3-month follow-up in a combined CT and medication treatment 
group compared with the medication-only and no treatment control 
group. To conclude, the beneﬁcial effects we found on episodic recall 
at 6-month follow-up are encouraging, but future studies should 
fully document the long-term efﬁcacy of CT in subjects with MCI 
and the impact on conversion to dementia. 

Our results showed cognitive training improved episodic recall, 
one of the memory components in the core cognitive impairment in 
MCI patients at risk of converting to AD. These data are promising in 
view of developing training methods to delay cognitive decline in 
A-MCI patients. However, many points remain to optimize the 
effects of training. In particular, the training tasks that best predict 
improvement should be determined. We believe that the simulta- 
neous training of memory and attention is an important parameter 
that may explain the beneﬁcial effects of training. However, we are 
not able to specify whether the positive effects are the result of a 
particular memory and attention training task, or of several, or all. 
Note that parameters were manipulated so that training tasks would 
continue to challenge each patient’s abilities throughout training. In 
our opinion, this is a prerequisite to promote the effects of training 
but, in retrospect, we may have applied this rule too frequently. It 
might have been more appropriate to promote stabilization of 
training performance, i.e. increase the repetition of the exercise 
without modifying parameters, before increasing the level of difﬁ- 
culty. We could probably give more power to training. Moreover, 
longitudinal and imaging studies should be conducted in particular 
on the long-term maintenance of the beneﬁts of training, which may 
reﬂect a persistent change in the cerebral substrates involved. 
Finally, future research should focus on the effects of such training 
on participants’ quality of life. Another group of A-MCImd patients 
who completed the same cognitive training as that presented in this 
study reported a positive impact on their self-esteem measured by 
the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale (data not shown). It would be of 
particular interest to evaluate the effects of such interventions on 
objective measures collected in an ecological framework.
