Introduction: Evidence for the efﬁcacy of cognitive training in patients with subcortical vascular 
cognitive impairment no dementia is still lacking. 
Methods: A randomized, active controlled design using multidomain, adaptive, computerized 
cognitive training for 30 minutes, 5 days/week for 7 weeks. Assessments included global cognitive 
function and executive function (primary outcomes) and brain functional connectivity and structural 
changes (secondary outcomes). 
Results: Sixty patients were randomized across three medical centers in Beijing. At the end of the 
intervention, the cognitive training group showed signiﬁcant improvement in Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment relative to the active control group (P 5 .013) and signiﬁcantly increased functional 
connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, which 
was signiﬁcantly correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment change (P 5 .017). 
Discussion: Computerized cognitive training signiﬁcantly improved global cognitive function, 
which was supported by the improved brain plasticity. Incorporation of biomarkers should be 
implemented in cognitive training trials.

Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is one of the most 
common causes of acquired cognitive impairment, second 
only to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [1]. Vascular cognitive 
impairment no dementia (VCIND) 
refers to cognitive 
deﬁcits associated with underlying vascular causes that are 
insufﬁcient to conﬁrm a diagnosis of dementia. According 
to the China Cognition and Aging Study, VCIND accounts 
for 42.0% of cases of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in 
China, rendering it the most common subtype of MCI 
therein [2]. A 5-year follow-up of patients with VCIND 
revealed that 50.0% of the patients developed dementia, 
including AD [3]. 
Although VCIND is potentially a key stage at which early 
intervention may delay or prevent dementia, an approved 
method of intervention has yet to be developed. Recent 
advances in cognitive training, however, may inform 
strategies to treat VCIND. In a healthy elderly population, 
the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital 
Elderly trial led to improvement in targeted domains and 
daily function, which was maintained across long-term 
follow-up [4]. In addition, computerized cognitive training 
has demonstrated potential as an effective intervention for 
patients with MCI or early AD [5]. Despite the promise of 
such ﬁndings, far fewer resources have been allocated to 
nonpharmacological approaches 
to treating dementia, 
including cognitive training, than to the development of 
pharmacological disease-modifying therapies [6]. Evidence 
for the efﬁcacy of cognitive training in patients with VCIND 
is 
signiﬁcant 
heterogeneity of VCIND, research must address the dearth 
of data on the efﬁcacy of intervention trials with respect to 
VCIND subtypes. 

The present study focused on the most common subtype 
of the disorder, VCIND caused by subcortical ischemic 
small vessel disease (subcortical VCIND), as its relatively 
homogenous features render it a suitable target condition 
for intervention trials. We conducted a randomized, active 
controlled trial 
to determine the efﬁcacy of a 7-week 
multidomain, adaptive, computerized cognitive training 
regimen in patients with subcortical VCIND (the 
Cog-VACCINE study). As executive dysfunction is the 
primary impairment associated with subcortical VCIND 
[7], we used the Trail Making Test (TMT) in tandem with 
assessing global cognitive function via the Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as an additional primary 
outcome to conﬁrm whether cognitive training could 
attenuate executive dysfunction in patients with subcortical 
VCIND. Observed alleviation of cognitive dysfunction 
would likely be accounted for by changes to brain plasticity 
[8], including increased gray matter volume, improved white 
matter 
functional 
connectivity. To assess these secondary outcomes and 
elucidate the mechanism underlying a possible effect of 
cognitive training, we performed structural magnetic 


resonance 
resonance imaging (fMRI). 




The present randomized, active controlled clinical trial 
was conducted in accordance with both the CONSORT 
statement and the CONSORT statement for nonpharmaco- 
logical interventions. Participants with subcortical VCIND 
were recruited from three centers: Xuanwu Hospital; 
Beijing Friendship Hospital; and Fu Xing Hospital, Capital 
Medical University. All participants provided written 
informed consent. Ethical approval was obtained from the 
Ethics Committee of Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical 
University (2015010). The trial was registered under 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02640716) and its protocol has 
been published previously [9]. 


The diagnosis of VCIND was based on evidence of both 
cognitive impairment without dementia and small vessel 
ischemic disease. All patients were diagnosed by a 
consensus panel including three senior neurologists and 
met the following inclusion criteria: (1) literate in Han 
(.4 days/week); 
Chinese with a consistent caregiver 
(2) complaint and/or 
report of cognitive 
impairment 
involving memory and/or other cognitive 
domains with a duration of at least 3 months; (3) according 
to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fourth Edition, the patients were neither normal 
nor demented as indicated by a clinical dementia rating of 
(cid:1)0.5 on at least one domain, a global score of (cid:3)0.5, and a 
Mini–Mental State Examination score of (cid:1)20 (primary 
school) or (cid:1)24 (junior school or above); and (4) normal or 
slightly impaired daily living activities as deﬁned by a total 
score of (cid:3)1.5 for the three functional clinical dementia 
rating domains (home and hobbies, community affairs, and 
personal care). We excluded participants who exhibited 
completion of 
any condition that would preclude 
than 
neuropsychological 
subcortical VCIND that would affect cognition. 




The MRI-based inclusion criteria details were as follows: 
(1) multiple ((cid:1)3) supratentorial subcortical small infarcts 
(3–20 mm in diameter) with/without white matter lesions 
of any degree or moderate-to-severe white matter lesions 
(score of (cid:1)2 according to the Fazekas rating scale [10]) 
with/without small 
(2) absence of cortical or 
watershed infarcts, hemorrhages, hydrocephalus, or white 
matter lesions with speciﬁc causes (e.g., multiple sclerosis); 
and (3) no hippocampal or entorhinal cortex atrophy (score 
of zero according to the medial temporal lobe atrophy scale 
of Scheltens [11]). 

Exclusion criteria included the following: (1) severe 
aphasia or other factors that might preclude completion of 


neuropsychological assessments or MRI; 
(2) clinically 
signiﬁcant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, respiratory, or 
other systemic diseases; and (3) other disorders or use of 
medication that might affect cognitive functions. 

The participants were randomly assigned to training or 
active control group. The personnel involved in conducting 
the study and data analysis were masked to the patient 
randomization. Study participants, their caregiver, and all 
assessors were blinded to treatment assignment throughout 
the study. 






a 
intervention 
computerized, multidomain, adaptive training program for 
7 weeks. The training domains included processing speed, 
attention, perception, long-term memory, working memory, 
calculation, executive control, 
reasoning, and problem 
solving. The rigor with which each domain was trained 
differed according to each task and informed the grouping 
of the tasks. Participants were required to complete 30 min 
of training per day (ﬁve 2-min tasks completed thrice), 
5 days a week. Within each task, high accuracy (.80%) 
was required to upgrade to the next difﬁculty level. 
The active control group received ﬁve processing speed 
and attention tasks, whose duration totaled to 30 min each 
training day. However, these tasks were set to a ﬁxed, 
primary difﬁculty level across the study. 
The training of all participants was completed at home 
and supervised by an independent neurologist over the 
Internet (www.66nao.com) to guarantee the fulﬁllment of 
the training. 
The intervention began directly after randomization. All 
the outcomes were assessed at 
the baseline, end of 
intervention, and 6 months after randomization to measure 
long-term resilience of the effect. For the details of the 
interventions, see Methods in Supplementary Materials. 

The primary outcome measures were global cognitive 
function, measured by MoCA, and executive function, 
measured by TMT B-A; both were centrally assessed. 


studies, we hypothesized that 
cognitive training could enhance functional and structural 
connectivity and/or local morphometry. The secondary 
outcomes of the present study therefore included structural 
the gray-matter volume of the 
and functional 
hippocampus, a key brain structure linked with memory 
impairment [12]; and white-matter (WM) integrity, which 
is associated with cognitive decline [13]. Functional 
connectivity was assessed in the default mode network 
(DMN) and the executive control network (ECN), 
two 
neurocognitive networks critical to the cognitive functions. 
Prior research has shown that the DMN and ECN are 
associated with pathological disconnection in cognitive 
decline and the progression of dementia [14], and cognitive 
training was found to modulate them [15]. 
In addition to the primary outcomes, we conducted other 
the 
neuropsychological 
the Digit Span, 
evaluations: 
WHO-UCLA Auditory Verbal Learning Test [16], 
the 
Boston Naming Test (BNT), the Hachinski Ischemic Scale, 
the Geriatric Depression Scale, 
the Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory, and an assessment of activities of daily living. 


The MRI data were acquired via a 3.0 T Siemens scanner. 
High-resolution T1-weighted images of the whole brain 
were obtained using a sagittal 3D magnetization-prepared 
rapid gradient echo sequence. Resting-state fMRI was 
conducted 
imaging 
sequence. DTI images were acquired by using a diffusion- 
weighted double spin-echo-planar imaging sequence. See 
Supplementary Materials for sequence details. 




Volumetric analysis was performed using FSL-integrated 
registration and segmentation toolbox (FIRST; https://fsl. 
fmrib.ox.ac.uk). Followed the FIRST processing guideline, 
the volume of the bilateral hippocampus was extracted and 
compared across groups via the linear mixed effect model 
(see Supplementary Materials for details). 

DTI data preprocessing was implemented using PANDA 
software (a pipeline tool for analyzing brain diffusion im- 
ages; http://www.nitrc.org/projects/panda/) [17]. Following 
the processing guideline, 
the fractional anisotropy was 
estimated and calculated. Fractional anisotropy of WM 
tracts associated with cognitive decline in VCI [13,18] was 
then extracted for analysis (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for 
details). 



Resting-state fMRI data were preprocessed by using the 
DPARSF (a toolbox for Data Processing and Analysis of 
Brain 
the 
http://www.rfmri.org) 
guideline (see Supplementary Materials for details) [19]. A 
seed-based approach was performed ﬁrst for baseline data 
to identify the DMN (seed in the posterior cingulate cortex, 
PCC) and ECN (seed in the left dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex, DLPFC.L). Based on the identiﬁed network, the 
mean time courses were extracted from bilateral DLPFC, 
inferior parietal lobule in the ECN, medial prefrontal cortex, 
and PCC in the DMN (blue in Supplementary Fig. 2), and the 
functional connectivity (Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients) 
was calculated between each pair of regions for the baseline, 
end of intervention, and 6-month follow-up data. The 


Fisher’s Z transformation correlation coefﬁcients were then 
extracted for each pair in each time point and used as inputs 
for the corresponding linear mixed effect models. 

All data were analyzed according to intent-to-treat 
principles. The effects of cognitive training on neuropsycho- 
logical scores and MRI data were examined using linear 
mixed effect models nested within individuals. Time was 
assigned as the repeated variable. Group, 
time, and 
group-by-time were included as ﬁxed effects. We analyzed 
the changes in the neuropsychological scores and MRI 
data from the baseline to the end of intervention and from 
baseline to 6-month follow-up. A statistically signiﬁcant 
difference (two tailed, P , .05) for any of the two primary 
outcomes at the end of the intervention would be considered 
as preliminary evidence of efﬁcacy. Correlation analyses 
between 
and 
neuropsychological scores were then performed to explore 
a potential neural mechanism for cognitive functional 
changes. 









Participants were enrolled from December 22, 2015 
through November 
follow-up 
measurements were obtained in May 8, 2017. The ﬂow of 
participants through the study is shown in Fig. 1. A total 
of 212 individuals from the neurology and geriatric clinics 
were included and assessed for eligibility. Of these, 152 
were excluded and the present study therefore enrolled a 
total of 60 patients. They were randomly assigned to the 
cognitive training or active control groups. A total of 54 
participants (27 in each group) ﬁnished the trial with good 
compliance. A total of 44 participants (23 in the training 
group and 21 in the active control group) completed the 
6-month follow-up. Of the 16 participants (26.7%) who 
withdrew from the study, ﬁve reported health issues, four 
reported time constraints, ﬁve were dissatisﬁed, and two 
issues. Baseline characteristics and 
reported personal 
neuropsychological assessment data are shown in Table 1. 
We found no group differences in age, sex, or duration of 
education. Except for immediate recall, the neuropsycholo- 
gical testing scores were matched between the two groups. 
All participants completed more than 90% of the training 
requirement. There was no signiﬁcant group difference in 
both training days (P 5 .167) and training time per day 
(P 5 .134) (Table 1). 

The changes from the baseline to the end of the 7-week 
intervention and from the baseline to the end of the 
6-month follow-up for the primary outcomes are shown in 


Fig. 2 and Table 2. There was a signiﬁcant group ! time 
interaction in MoCA at the end of the intervention period. 
After 7 weeks, MoCA had signiﬁcantly improved in the 
cognitive training group (from 21.87 to 25.22) relative to

the active control group (21.23 to 21.15), with an effect size 
of 0.637 (95% CI 0.115–1.153) compared with the control 
group. This difference did not persist at 
the 6-month 
follow-up. We found no signiﬁcant group ! time interaction 
in the TMT B-A. 

Secondary outcome measures included hippocampal GM 
volume, WM integrity, and functional connectivity. There 
was no signiﬁcant group ! time effect for hippocampus 
GM volume (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1) or WM 
integrity (Supplementary Table 1). 
Critically, at the end of the intervention, there was a 
signiﬁcant group ! time interaction for the connectivity 
between the DLPFC.L and medial prefrontal cortex 
(Fig. 4). Furthermore, we found a signiﬁcant increase in 
connectivity from the baseline to the end of the intervention 
in the training group; this change was absent in the active 
control group. The enhanced connectivity across the 
intervention was positively correlated with MoCA changes 
(r 5 0.463, P 5 .017) in the training group but not in the 
active control group (r 5 0.08, P 5 .68). No signiﬁcant 
group ! time interaction for connectivity was found 
the 6-month follow-up 
between the other pairs or at 
(Supplementary Table 2). 



signiﬁcant 
group ! time interaction was observed in the BNT 
(Fig. 2) at the end of the intervention (effect size 5 0.560, 
95% CI 0.042–1.074, P 5 .028); this ﬁnding had also 
dissipated by the 6-month follow-up. No signiﬁcant 
group ! time interaction was observed in the activities of 
daily living, Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Digit Span, 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory, or Geriatric Depression Scale. 




VCIND features potential as an effective point at which 
interventions may delay or even prevent dementia. The 
Cog-VACCINE study is the ﬁrst registered randomized 
controlled trial to investigate the efﬁcacy of computerized, 
multidomain, adaptive cognitive training in patients with 
subcortical VCIND. The strengths of the present study 
include its active control design and use of both 
neuropsychological evaluation and sMRI and fMRI as 
outcomes. 
Concerning primary outcomes, we found that relative to 
the active control condition, cognitive training led to a 
signiﬁcant improvement in global cognitive function, as 
in executive function, as 
measured by MoCA, but not 
measured by TMT B-A, by the end of 
the 7-week 
intervention. This result is consistent with ﬁndings from a 
recent meta-analysis of computerized cognitive training 
[5]: although computerized cognitive training affected 
small-to-moderate improvements in the global cognition of 
patients with mild cognitive impairment, the meta-analysis 
reported a lack of efﬁcacy on executive function. This is 
further endorsed by another meta-analysis of 16 studies 
that showed a small but signiﬁcant effect of cognitive 
training among MCI patients; however, 13 of them failed 
to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect of cognitive training on executive 
functions [20]. Small samples or inadequate training of 
executive processes may account for the nonsigniﬁcant 
results in previous studies. Although processing speed, 
inhibitory control, and reasoning were included in our 
the inclusion of more 
multidomain training paradigm, 
executive tasks may have yielded stronger gains 
in 
the elderly 
executive function. The limited ability of 
participants, particularly those with relatively more severe 
cognitive impairment, to transfer gains from trained to 
untrained cognitive domains provides an alternative 
explanation [21].

Fig. 3. Training effect on the hippocampus volume. The hippocampus was deﬁned by FSL-integrated registration and segmentation toolbox (FIRST) following 
guidelines from FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk). No signiﬁcant training effect on hippocampus volume was found in either hemisphere. Red lines represent the 
cognitive training group, and the blue lines represent the active control group. 
yet no signiﬁcant group ! time interaction was found. 
Similarly, in line with a recent study showing that cognitive 
training in MCI induced no improvement in brain structure 
[22], no training effect on WM integrity was found [23]. 
The cognitive training group did, however, exhibit 
signiﬁcant increases in functional connectivity between the 
DLPFC.L and medial prefrontal cortex by the end of 
intervention. Evidence from AD studies showed that the 
anticorrelation between the DMN and ECN found in healthy 
adults was diminished in MCI and AD patients [14]. In 
agreement with the results found in the healthy elderly 
[15] and AD patients [24], our results suggest that the 
disconnection can be rebuilt by cognitive training [25].

anticorrelation connectivity was linked with larger MoCA

changes may suggest improvement in brain plasticity for 
cognitive improvement. The changes in both MoCA and 
functional connectivity disappeared at 6-month follow-up, 
possibly on account of the training duration having been 
too short to yield long-term effects on structural integrity 
markers detected via sMRI. Because these are the ﬁrst data 
concerning VCIND collected by an explorative analysis, 
this ﬁnding requires replication in an independent sample. 
The number of cognitive training studies has increased 
over the last few years [5]. Most of such studies have used 
neuropsychological assessments as outcomes to assess the 
direct 
intervention. However, 
of 
neuropsychological evaluation does not yield insights into 
changes.

Moreover, AD studies have shown that the incorporation 
of biomarkers, especially those reﬂecting the underlying 
pathophysiological mechanism of AD progression or targets 
of intervention, in clinical trials could help to reveal target

engagement and identify evidence of disease modiﬁcation 
[26], such as CSF Ab1–42 and amyloid PET for antiamyloid 
therapeutic trials [27]. Similarly, 
the incorporation of 
biomarkers should also be encouraged in cognitive training 
clinical trials, as brain plastic changes are expected to 
underlie functional gains achieved by cognitive training 
[28]; the combined use of sMRI and fMRI is a potential 
proxy of changes in brain plasticity [29]. Recently, clinical 
trials on cognitive training effects in AD have begun to 
consider the use of fMRI ﬁndings as markers to elucidate 
the mechanisms underlying clinical efﬁcacy [24]. We 
therefore included sMRI and fMRI indices previously found 
to be associated with cognitive decline in dementia 
conversion as secondary outcomes in the present study. We 
found 
functional 
training 
connectivity between the DMN and ECN, which was 
in global 
signiﬁcantly correlated with improvement 
cognitive function. Our study therefore suggests that

for 
cognitive training studies not only in AD [30] but also in 
VCIND. 





In addition to MoCA and TMT B-A, we analyzed the 
effect of intervention on other cognitive domains. Our 
results showed that cognitive training signiﬁcantly improved 
language function as measured by BNT. While one 
meta-analysis 
reported that cognitive training had a 
beneﬁcial effect on language function [20], another 
meta-analysis reported null ﬁndings on language function 
two 
in 
meta-analyses had different results for test statistics, they 
had similar effect sizes for language function (Hedges’ 
g 5 0.511 and 0.41, respectively). The inconsistent results 
are probably due to the high heterogeneity (I2 5 80.69% 
for the null ﬁnding). However, in patients with cognitive 
impairment after stroke, computerized training improved 
global function as well as the BNT scores [31], which 
supported the present ﬁnding. 




Although cognitive training affected a signiﬁcant 
improvement 
internetwork 
connectivity after the 7-week intervention, the improve- 
ment disappeared by the 6-month follow-up. Regarding 
the resilience of cognitive training gains, the literature is 
inconsistent. One previous 
investigation found that 
although cognitive training prevented memory decline of 
MCI patients during a 6-month intervention period, this 
effect had dissipated by the 18-month follow-up [32]. By 
contrast, the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent 
and Vital Elderly trial showed that, in cognitively normal 
older adults, 10–14 weeks of cognitive training with 
booster training induced signiﬁcant improvements in the 
trained domains that persisted up to 5–10 years [4]. 
Considered in the context of our ﬁndings, the maintenance 
of a training effect is less likely among those with some 
degree of cognitive impairment. For subcortical VCIND 
patients to sustain cognitive improvements, continuous 
training is recommended. 
The present study is subject to several limitations. First, 
the signiﬁcant attenuation of the improvements by the 
6-month follow-up suggests that a longer intervention period 
is needed to observe potentially sustainable beneﬁts of 
cognitive training. Second, although this 
study used 
well-deﬁned inclusion and exclusion criteria for subcortical 
VCIND, we cannot rule out 
the possibility of mixed 
such as concomitant AD. By excluding 
pathology, 
individuals with indications of atrophy of the hippocampus 
or entorhinal cortex, we likely excluded individuals with 
advanced AD pathology; however, prodromal stages with 
increased amyloid load could not be excluded. Future 
studies using AD biomarkers are needed to rigorously 
evaluate the efﬁcacy of cognitive training in patients 
with subcortical VCIND and to test whether different 
pathologies respond differentially to cognitive training. 
Third, as the ﬁrst registered randomized controlled trial 
study 
computerized 
cognitive training in subcortical VCIND, except for the 
mostly used primary outcome-global cognitive function, 
we also explored the training effect on the characteristic 
executive dysfunction in subcortical VCIND. Therefore, 
both MoCA and TMT B-A were set as primary outcomes. 
In the interest of an unambiguous outcome of the study, it 
that 
would have been preferable to declare a priori 
observing a statistically signiﬁcant difference in any of the 
two primary outcomes would provide preliminary evidence 
of efﬁcacy. 





In conclusion, the computerized, multidomain, adaptive 
cognitive training improved global cognitive function and 
the connection between two cognition-related networks, 
the DMN and ECN, in patients with subcortical VCIND. 
The signiﬁcant correlation between the restored connection 
and improved global cognitive function suggested that 
biomarkers of functional connectivity as proxy for effects 
of brain plasticity should be incorporated as outcomes in 
cognitive training trials. Although the efﬁcacy and good 
safety proﬁle of cognitive training in patients with 
subcortical VCIND recommend its adoption, more clinical 
trials are needed for further evidence.

1. Systematic review: We searched ClinicalTrials.gov 
and WHO’s International Clinical Trial Registry 
Platform up to August 31, 2018, 
to identify 
randomized controlled trials. Search terms were 
“vascular cognitive impairment no dementia OR 
mild vascular cognitive impairment OR mild 
vascular 
cognitive disorder” AND “cognitive 
training OR cognitive intervention.” The present 
study was the only identiﬁed randomized controlled 
trial. 
2. Interpretation: While the focus of dementia trials has 
shifted to presymptomatic and predementia stages, 
much less effort has been applied to patients with 
vascular cognitive impairment no dementia, which 
is a potential key stage to delay or prevent dementia. 
This approach is similar to a nonpharmacological 
intervention, a tractable and feasible way to improve 
the quality of life of patients with cognitive disorders. 
Except for the efﬁcacy of computerized cognitive 
training in subcortical vascular cognitive impairment 
study also provides 
no dementia, 
evidence for the incorporation of brain plasticity bio- 
markers into cognitive training trials. 

3. Future directions: Large, 
needed for further evidence.
