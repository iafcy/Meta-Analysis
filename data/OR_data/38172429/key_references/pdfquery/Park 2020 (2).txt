Abstract: The present study examined whether a culture-based virtual reality (VR) training program 
is feasible and tolerable for patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and whether 
it could improve cognitive function in these patients. Twenty-one outpatients with aMCI were 
randomized to either the VR-based training group or the control group in a 1:1 ratio. The VR-based 
training group participated in training for 30 min/day, two days/week, for three months (24 times). 
The VR-based program was designed based on Korean traditional culture and used attention, 
processing speed, executive function and memory conditions to stimulate cognitive function. 
The adherence to the culture-based VR training program was 91.55% ± 6.41% in the VR group. 
The only adverse events observed in the VR group were dizziness (4.2%) and fatigue (8.3%). 
Analysis revealed that the VR-based training group exhibited no signiﬁcant diﬀerences following 
the three-month VR program in Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) scores, working 
memory functions such as performance on the digit span test, or in Stroop test performance and word 
ﬂuency. We conclude that although the 12-week culture-based VR training program did not improve 
cognitive function, our ﬁndings revealed that the culture-based VR training program was feasible 
and tolerable for participants with aMCI. 


Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a condition of declined cognitive function that 
might indicate the early phases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or other dementias [1]. Patients with 
aMCI are considered to be in the stage between normal aging and dementia, and still have the ability

to perform daily errands [1,2]. Therefore, early intervention at the aMCI stage can allow patients to 
retain and even improve their cognitive function [3]. 
Innovative technologies have recently played an important role in cognitive assessment, cognitive 
modeling, and changes in the ﬁeld of neuropsychology [4,5]. In particular, virtual reality (VR) is a 
tool that allows subjects to be completely involved in an imitation of an actual situation, which is 
rich in temporal naturalistic and spatial contexts. VR helps to address a number of limitations in 
the research of cognitive function due to its distinct characteristics [6]. It is noted that VR shares the 
same basic mechanism with the human brain—embodied simulation—and thus with this embodied 
technology it is possible to facilitate cognitive modeling and change by designing virtual environments 
to simulate both the external and internal world [7]. Therefore, VR has emerged as a rising tool 
of cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive rehabilitation for aMCI and dementia [8]. Previous 
studies reported that performance in VR applications has been shown to correlate with subjective 
memory complaints [9], and VR applications have exhibited promising results during the assessment 
of cognitive functions [9,10]. A feasibility study targeting healthy older adults showed that participants 
were motivated by VR-based tasks and environment, and that these tasks and environments could be 
helpful to improve the participants’ memory in a laboratory setting [11]. 
However, previous studies are limited in several aspects. Firstly, a majority of previous VR 
studies has been conducted in Western countries, and limited studies have been conducted in the 
context of culture-based VR. In particular, culture-based VR training programs for subjects of diﬀerent 
cultural or environmental backgrounds are still needed. For example, a program can be designed 
based on a Korean traditional game, which may spur older Korean adults’ memory and increase 
their motivation to attend a VR training program. Secondly, previous studies were also limited by 
only focusing on memory. It remains unclear what the eﬀects of VR-based training programs are on 
diﬀerent domains of cognitive function, such as attention, executive function and processing speed. 
Finally, most previous studies were conducted in community-based settings [11], which may be limited 
by a lack of professionals to perform neuropsychological assessments. To ﬁll these research gaps, 
the present study used a clinical setting and aimed to examine: (1) whether a culture-based VR training 
program is feasible and tolerable for patients with aMCI; and (2) the eﬀect of a 12-week culture-based 
VR training program on diﬀerent domains of cognitive function among patients with aMCI. 


Patients aged between 50 and 80 years with a diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment 
(aMCI) were eligible in the present study. Based on the operationalized Petersen aMCI criteria [1], 
the inclusion criteria were as follows: 


2. Memory complaint: A subjective memory complaint that was conﬁrmed by an informant. 
3. 
Impaired memory: A delayed recall score on the Seoul Verbal Learning test < 1 SD below age- 
and education-adjusted normative means [14,15]. 
4. Not demented: A Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale of <0.5 [16]. 
5. Normal daily functioning: the Seoul Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) ≤ 7 [17]. 
All subjects were not diagnosed with dementia, had a Hachinski Ischemic Score of ≤4 [18], and a 
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan showing no other 
condition that could cause cognitive impairment. 
The exclusion criteria included the following: (1) The subject had a history of stroke or was being 
treated for a stroke or epilepsy; (2) the subject had other suspected degenerative diseases or mental 
illnesses; and (3), subjects who were depressed or abusing substances, had head injuries, thyroid 


malfunction or other medical abnormalities that could impair cognitive function. We conducted this 
study according to the International Harmonization Conference guidelines on Good Clinical Practice. 
The procedure of this study was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board of Dong-A University 
Hospital. All subjects or their legally authorized representatives provided written informed consent for 
the participation in the study. Finally, subjects were 21 out-patients with aMCI, who were randomized 

to either the VR-based training group or the control group. This study was registered in the University 
Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) Clinical Trials Registry (no. UMIN000030187). 







The patients who had been diagnosed with aMCI by a dementia clinician from a memory and 
dementia clinic at a university hospital were recruited. We used Statistical Analysis System (SAS) 
programming to randomly assign the participants with a 1:1 ratio to a VR group (n = 10) and a control 
group (n = 11) by the block randomization method. The VR-based training program was designed as a 
multicomponent restorative cognitive function training. Participants in the control group were asked 
to maintain their normal daily activities during the study, and were informed that they would be able 
asked to maintain their normal daily activities during the study, and were informed that they would 
to participate in the virtual reality (VR)-based training program after the end of the study. Assessments 
were performed before the start of the VR-based training program (baseline) and after the intervention 
(follow-up). The procedure of this study is shown in Figure 1.

in this study included general cognitive assessments, 
the assessment of depression symptoms and detailed neurocognitive function. According to 
standardized methods, neuropsychologists from a hospital performed the general cognitive assessments 
on the potential subjects, including the K-MMSE [12,13]. The 15-item Korean version of the Geriatric 
Depression Scale (SGDS-K) was utilized to measure the subjects’ depression symptoms [19,20]. 
The Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery, Dementia version (SNSB-D) was used to evaluate 
detailed neurocognitive function [14,15], which includes tests for attention, frontal lobe executive 
function and verbal functions. The digit span test (forward and backward) was used to assess the 
function of attention [21]. Moreover, the Korean color-word Stroop test was utilized to assess frontal 
lobe executive function [14,15]. Finally, word ﬂuency tests (category and letter ﬂuency) were utilized 
to measure verbal function [22]. 

The head-mounted displays consisted of a headset, two controllers and two infrared laser emitter 
units (HTC Vive, New Taipei City, Taiwan). The HTC Vive used an organic LED display and had an 
integrated resolution of 2160 × 1200 (1080 × 1200 per eye), with a refresh rate of 90 Hz and a ﬁeld of 
view of approximately 110 degrees. The weight of the head-mounted display is approximately 555 g. 
The head-mounted display had HDMI 1.4, DisplayPort 1.2 and USB 2.0 connections [23]. 
The VR-based training group underwent training for 30 min/day, two days/week for three months, 
corresponding to a total 24 times. The VR-based training program was conducted to aid attention, 
processing speed, executive function and memory conditions, in order to stimulate cognitive function. 
In each session, 10 min of warm-up and 20 min for two selected games (i.e., memory and/or attention 
and/or executive function, processing speed) were set for participants according to their level of ability 
(i.e., high, middle or low), requirements and choice. In VR games, neurologists prepared speciﬁc 
cognitive tasks such as memory function and processing speed while playing games for the elderly. 
An occupational therapist demonstrated the game controls and gave instructions to ensure that the 
participants understood how to control the system. The participants were asked to rest and stretch 
their eyes for a short time when their hypertonicity interfered with the control of the game. 
Attention was assessed using the “Crows and Seagulls” game. This game involves shooting 
crows among seagulls, and helps to improve the level of attention and perceptual space skills. 
The setting of this game is a traditional bridge in Korea. “Seek a Song of Our Own” is a game 
that involves participants hitting targets on a screen according to the rhythm and drumming of the 
“Janggu”, the Korean traditional drum. This game is for elderly participants, and aims to improve 
the participants’ level of attention. Processing speed was assessed using the “Automated Teller 
Machine (ATM) machine” game, which involves withdrawing money according to a given amount 
on the screen. This game aimed to improve numerical ability and perceptivity. To assess frontal lobe 
executive function, the “Shopping in the Mart” game was used; this game involves shopping in a mart 
for items needed by the participants’ family. This game aimed to improve the level of perceptivity, 
numerical ability and logical ability. Both the “ATM machine” and “Shopping in the Mart” games were 
designed based on activities of daily living. Korean Memory was assessed using the “Fireworks Party” 
game, which involves decorating a night sky by launching ﬁreworks in a numerical order. This game 
aimed to improve and train the memory of participants. The “Fruit Cocktail” game was also used 
to train memory, in which participants made a cocktail by answering questions. Table 1 shows the 
detailed protocols of the VR-based training program. Figure 2 shows examples of culture-based VR 
training tasks.

We used IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for data analysis in the 
present study. A Shapiro–Wilk test was used to test the assumptions of distributional normality, and 
showed that the distribution of all parameters did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from normal. The student’s 
t-test was utilized to compare the baseline variables. We also utilized a two-factor repeated-measures 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the interaction (group × time) eﬀects for all outcome 

variables. All results are shown as the mean ± SD. A signiﬁcant level was set at 0.05. 





The socio-demographic, physical, mental and cognitive baseline characteristics of the participants 
are shown in Table 2. At baseline, no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed in any of the characteristics 
between the virtual reality (VR) group and the control group. The results also showed that the adherence 
to the VR-based training program was 91.55% ± 6.41% in the VR group. The only adverse events 
observed in the treatment groups were dizziness (4.2%) and fatigue (8.3%) during the three-month VR 
program (data not shown). Table 3 shows the changes in the mental and cognitive function of the VR 

and control groups at baseline and after 12 weeks. At baseline, no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the SGDS-K 

scores between the two groups were found. For the SGDS-K scores, the two-way repeated-measures 
ANOVA indicated no main eﬀect of time and no interaction between time and group. Within-group 
analysis indicated that the SGDS-K scores did not change signiﬁcantly in either group after 12 weeks, but 
the values tended to be lower than the baseline values in the VR group after 12 weeks (95% CI = −0.87 
to 3.07 score, p = 0.240). For the K-MMSE scores, the two-way repeated-measures ANOVA indicated 
no interactions between time and group. Within-group analysis indicated that the K-MMSE scores did

This study ﬁlls a research gap, and is the ﬁrst that uses a clinical setting to examine the eﬀect 
of culture-based virtual reality (VR) training programs on diﬀerent domains of cognitive function, 
and their tolerability in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Our ﬁndings 
showed that the 12-week culture-based VR training program did not improve diﬀerent domains of 
cognitive function. Nevertheless, our results further revealed that the culture-based VR training 
was well-tolerated (negative event of dizziness was 4.2% and fatigue was 8.3%), and with good 
compliance (compliance rate: 91.55% ± 6.41%) during the three-month VR program in our study 
sample. Our ﬁndings may inform therapists and rehabilitation personnel that culture-based VR 
training programs can be a promising tool for future training programs for patients with aMCI in the 
context of culture-based. 
Contrary to our hypothesis, our 12-week culture-based VR training program did not improve 
cognitive function among patients with aMCI compared to the control group. Although existing 
literature shows that VR is an embodied technology that facilitates cognitive modeling and change by 
designing virtual environments to simulate both the external and internal world [7], there are several 
possible explanations for this inconsistency. Firstly, it is inconsistent with a previous study [24] that 
reported that long-term intervention (six months of VR memory training) in the elderly signiﬁcantly 
improved memory function. Moreover, a previous review also reported that short-term VR-based 
training programs are less eﬀective in improving cognitive function during aMCI or dementia [25]. 
The short duration of our study might explain this diﬀerence in results in patients with aMCI. Another 
possible explanation could be that our culture-based VR training program was designed to assess 
attention, executive function and memory conditions in order to stimulate cognitive function, but 
was not designed for dual tasks (i.e., both cognitive and exercise training). An important review 
has indicated that exercise plays a critical role in the prevention of dementia [26], and can improve 
cognitive function in aMCI patients [27]. Previous studies have shown that dual tasks (cognitive and 
exercise training) could have positive eﬀects on cognitive function among the elderly. For example, 
Anderson-Hanley et al [28]. found that older adults who participated in stationary cycling with virtual 
reality tours had improved cognitive function compared to traditional exercisers, which suggested 
that engaging in both cognitive and physical exercise could be eﬀective for the prevention of cognitive 
decline [28]. Therefore, future intervention studies may consider using VR-based exercise and cognitive 
training programs to further conﬁrm the eﬀects of these programs on cognitive function among patients 
with aMCI. 
The present study had some limitations. First, this study is a pilot study, and thus the sample 
size was small, which limits the statistical power to determine the signiﬁcance of our ﬁndings. Thus, 
it is still required for further studies using larger sample sizes to identify the eﬀectiveness of regular 
VR-based training. Second, the time spent in physical activity outside our study was not measured in 
our participants, and might potentially inﬂuence the results of the study. Third, potential confounders 
such as diet, physical activity, sleep and other cognitive activity were not controlled in this study, and 
these lifestyle factors, such as physiological and dietary/nutritional proﬁles [29], as well as physical 
activity [30] and sleep patterns, might aﬀect our results. Nevertheless, this study using a randomized 
controlled design could avoid bias, and truly allows for a direct comparison between two groups. 
Finally, there was only a VR-based intervention group and a control group in this study. Future studies 
with an ideal active control condition would be needed. 

In conclusion, the present ﬁndings demonstrate that the 12-week culture-based virtual reality (VR) 
training program did not improve diﬀerent domains of cognitive function during interaction, but the 
VR-based training was well-tolerated and showed good compliance. Finally, it would be valuable to 
investigate whether long-term modiﬁcations of the culture-based VR training program can help to 
slow the progression of dementia in a large population.
