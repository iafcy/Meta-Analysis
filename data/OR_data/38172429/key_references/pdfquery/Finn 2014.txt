with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. A randomized controlled 
trial

The results of a randomized controlled trial of repetition-lag training in older adults 
with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are reported. A modified repetition- 
lag training procedure with extended encoding time and strategy choice was used. The 
training required discriminating studied words from non-studied lures that were 
repeated at varying intervals during the test phase. Participants were assessed pre/ 
post using untrained measures of cognition and self-report questionnaires. Primary 
outcome measures were recall of unrelated word pairs both immediately following 
presentation and following a delay. Secondary outcomes were a measure of attention, 
cognitive flexibility, and visual working memory. Participants were also asked to report 
on the frequency of cognitive failures and mood before and after training. Participants 
(N = 31) were randomized into either the treatment or a no-contact control group and 
attended the clinic twice per week over a four week period. Twenty-four participants 
completed the study (twelve in each group). Results indicated that the training group 
improved at recalling unrelated word pairs after a delay. There were no significant 
effects of training on other outcomes, self-reported cognitive failures or mood. The 
results are discussed along with suggestions for future research.

Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) involves significant impairments on objec- 
tive measures of memory compared with age-matched peers but with intact activities of 
daily living (Petersen, 2004). Impairments can be restricted to memory alone or include 
deficits in other areas of cognition such as visuospatial ability, executive functions and 
language. The risk of conversion to dementia is high in this group (Ravaglia et al., 2006), 
which underscores the need to find ways to improve or maintain memory functioning. 
Attempts to improve memory in aMCI often involve teaching memory strategies (Troyer, 
Murphy, Anderson, Moscovitch, & Craik, 2008), an approach which may be well suited 
to a particular recall task, i.e., remembering the name of an acquaintance (Hampstead, 
Sathian, Moore, Nalisnick, & Stringer, 2008). While these interventions can be effective 
in providing a strategy for the intended situation, they may be limited in scope and rely on 
an unreliable memory for implementation. An alternative approach seeks to remediate 
underlying memory processes that are impaired in aMCI and which may contribute to

memory failures in a range of situations. By identifying these processes, it may be 
possible to provide training interventions that are both more efficient and more likely to 
transfer to other recall situations that rely on the trained process. 
There is an extensive literature on memory processes in both normal elderly and in 
memory-impaired groups. One area of investigation, dual-process theory (Jacoby, 1991; 
Mandler, 1980) has drawn a distinction between controlled (conscious, effortful) and 
implicit) processes. The recognition memory literature has 
automatic (unconscious, 
further distinguished between the automatic process “familiarity” (for example, knowing 
you have seen someone before without conscious recollection as to where) and a 
controlled process known as “recollection” (retaining memory of the contextual informa- 
tion, e.g., they were the person who sold you tickets to a concert). There is evidence that 
normal elderly, aMCI and Alzheimer’s disease groups (Adam, Van der Linden, Collette, 
Lemauvais, & Salmon, 2005; Jennings & Jacoby, 1997; Smith & Knight, 2002) are less 
able to engage processes underlying recollection, instead tending to rely more on famil- 
iarity. This suggests that recollection might be a suitable target for remediation via 
systematic training that encourages both deeper encoding and retention of this information 
over a period of time. 
Repetition-lag training 
One method of training recollection is repetition-lag training (RLT), a form of recognition 
memory training that encourages recollection over mere familiarity. The RLT procedure 
requires the learning of a series of words and subsequent discrimination of those words 
from unstudied lures. The task differs from a straightforward recognition task in that the 
lures are repeated at varying intervals known as lags, and the length of the lag increases as 
performance improves. 
Initial studies (Jacoby, Jennings, & Hay, 1996; Jennings & Jacoby, 2003) using RLT 
involved normal elderly and suggested that problems in recollection on the RLT were (1) 
related to self-reported memory complaints, (2) that recollection could be improved with 
training, and (3) the training effect was driven by incremented difficulty. Incremented 
difficulty occurs when the lags are systematically increased once a criterion level of 
performance is reached. This progressive increase in task difficulty is thought to force 
participants to develop and/or practice strategies to recollect at longer intervals. Jennings 
and Jacoby (2003) found that when intervals were systematically increased in this way, 
recollection improved more than when the intervals were varied randomly. 

There is encouraging evidence of transfer following RLT. For example, Jennings, Webster, 
Kleykamp, and Dagenbach (2005) reported gains on n-back task (a measure of working 
memory), the Source discrimination task (visual long-term memory), Digit-symbol sub- 
stitution (processing speed), and the Self-ordered pointing test (non-spatial executive 
working memory). In another study using a modified form of RLT (Lustig & Flegal, 
2008) gains were found on Trails B (cognitive flexibility) along with a reduction in self- 
reported memory errors as measured by the Everyday Memory Questionnaire. In a group 
with Alzheimer’s disease (Boller, Jennings, Dieudonné, Verny, & Ergis, 2012) transfer 
gains were seen on an n-back task (working memory), RL/R1 (episodic recognition 
memory), DMS 48 task (visual recognition memory), and the source recognition task 
(recognition memory). One conference report found gains in a group with aMCI on the 


California Verbal Learning Test – Second Edition (CVLT-II) measures of immediate and 
delayed, free and cued recall (Jennings et al., 2006). Encouragingly, the transfer effects 
observed in these studies do not appear to be due to expectancy effects or social contact, 
as active control groups completing a recognition practice task did not show similar gains. 
Potential transfer gains in aMCI following RLT are worthy of further investigation, given 
that recollection is impaired in this population and that successful training may have 
beneficial effects across a range of recall situations encountered in everyday life. 

Under the original RLT procedure, encoding time is limited to 2 seconds per word. 
Bissig and Lustig (2007) found that under a modified RLT procedure, with open-ended 
encoding time, the time spent on encoding was the major determinant of performance 
rather than factors such as age or crystallized intelligence. This appeared to be due to 
how the time at encoding was used. Participants who spontaneously utilized a self- 
generated strategy to aid learning performed better than those who did not or those who 
simply relied on repetition. The observation that a self-generated memory strategy may 
improve performance, echoes work by Derwinger, Stigsdotter-Neely, MacDonald, and 
Backman (2005), where elderly participants who came up with their own strategy 
information for longer periods compared with peers who were 
retained numerical 
given a specific mnemonic strategy to aid recall. This finding was subsequently tested 
by Lustig and Flegal (2008) who increased encoding time to 14 second, and instructed 
participants to either make a sentence out of each word, or to think about the meaning 
of the word, without offering a specific strategy. They found that allowing participants 
to choose their own strategy during extended encoding aided performance compared 
with being instructed on which strategy to use. Given this, it seems reasonable to 
suggest that optimizing performance of an aMCI sample on the RLT procedure could 
involve encouraging participants to think of some way to remember the words (while 
leaving the exact method for doing so open) and extending the encoding period for each 
word to allow sufficient time for this to occur. 
Taken together, the existing research literature suggests that RLT targets a process 
known to be impaired in aMCI, and that there is some evidence of transfer following 
training. The adapted procedure with extended encoding time allows time for participants 
to generate their own strategy. However, these effects have yet to be tested in an aMCI 
group despite calls to do so (Anderson et al., 2008; Ranganath, Flegal, & Kelly, 2011; 
Shumaker, Legault, & Coker, 2006). 

(1) To assess the ability of aMCI participants to complete a RLT program modified to 
allow extended encoding time and strategy choice. It was hypothesized that aMCI 
participants would be able to increase their lag level across the course of training. 
To ensure that improvements on the training task did, in fact, reflect improve- 
ments in recollection it was also hypothesized that there would be no change in 
either accuracy or response bias across training. If recollection alone is improving 
then accuracy (proportion of “hits,” i.e., saying yes to a studied word; minus 
proportion of false alarms, responding “yes” to a new word) should not change 
across training. Such a finding would suggest that improvements during training 
are due to a change in the ability to correctly discriminate studied words from 


repeated lures (recollection). Changes in response bias could indicate that parti- 
cipants simply learned to respond “no” more often without truly recollecting if the 
word was from the studied list or a new word. 
(2) To measure transfer gains in recollection following training. It was hypothesized 
that aMCI participants would show improved recollection following RLT. 
Recollection was operationalized as recall of unrelated word pairs, both immedi- 
ately following presentation and again after a delay. The Verbal Paired Associates 
Test (from the Wechsler Memory Scale – Fourth Edition, Wechsler, 2009) con- 
tains both related (“sock-shoe”) and unrelated word pairs (“laugh-stand”). This 
task is known to be sensitive to the kinds of memory impairment seen in aMCI 
(Perri, Carlesimo, Serra, & Caltagirone, 2005), and recall of unrelated word pairs 
may be a more sensitive measure of recollection than related word pairs (Amieva, 
Rouch-Leroyer, Fabrigoule, & Dartigues, 2000). 
(3) To extend findings by other researchers that RLT may improve working memory 
(measured here by Symbol Span) and cognitive flexibility (Trails B). Finally, we 
explored the effect of training on self-reported everyday cognitive failures 
(Cognitive Failures Questionnaire) and on mood (DASS-21). It was thought 
that RLT may result in reduced frequency of self-reported cognitive failures. A 
measure of mood was included to gauge the impact (either positive or negative) of 
RLT on mood. 
Method 
Participants 
Community dwelling clients of Aged Care Services at Royal North Shore Hospital who 
had been assessed for memory problems in the Memory and Geriatric Speciality Clinics in 
the previous 12 months were nominally eligible to participate. These clinical assessments 
typically involved a physical exam, clinical history, detailed neuropsychological testing 
and cerebral 
imaging. Participants were excluded due to reasons such as having a 
diagnosis other than aMCI, co-morbid psychiatric problems, having moved outside the 
boundaries of the area health service, progression to dementia, or recent commencement 
on a cholinesterase inhibitor. Participants gave written informed consent in accordance 
with HREA requirements. As aMCI is an unstable diagnosis, to ensure that all participants 
continued to meet the criteria for aMCI the remaining potential participants were further 
screened as per the following criteria: 
(1) Diagnosis of amnestic MCI (single or multiple domain). Participants with non- 
amnestic MCI were not eligible to participate. MCI was determined using stan- 
dardized diagnostic criteria (Winblad et al., 2004). All participants had a recent 
(<12 months old) neuropsychological evaluation that indicated objective impair- 
ments in memory (at least 1.5 SD below age and education related normative 
data). 
(2) Intact global cognitive functioning (score >23) on the Mini Mental State 
(Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975); absence of 
Examination (MMSE) 
untreated psychiatric illness or substance abuse problems; and absence of visual, 
auditory or motor impairment that would hinder use of a computer. Participants 
who were on stable doses of cholinesterase inhibitors for the duration of the study 


were eligible to take part, but participants who commenced taking these medica- 
tions during the study were excluded. 
Participants with both aMCI Single domain (n = 8) and aMCI – Multiple domain (n = 23) 
were included in the study. Demographic and neuropsychological data for the 31 partici- 
pants who were originally recruited into the study are shown in Table 1, as well as data for 
those who completed the study. Baseline comparisons (t-tests) revealed no significant 
differences between the treatment and control group on these variables. 
Twenty-four participants completed the study, twelve in each arm, with four treatment 
and three control group participants either withdrawing or being excluded. The four 
withdrawals all occurred after randomization but prior to commencing the study. The 
primary reasons for withdrawal were unrelated medical or personal issues. Those who 
withdrew did not differ from those who completed the study in terms of age, sex, 
education, or depressive symptoms. In the treatment group, 
two participants were 
excluded, one because his memory functioning was not sufficiently impaired to meet 
the study criteria, despite a clinical presentation in keeping with aMCI. Another 
participant was excluded as she was unable to complete the training within the five 
week time-frame permitted. In the control group, one participant was excluded due to a 
diagnosis of non-amnestic MCI. The flow of participants through the study to the posttest 
assessment is shown in Figure 1. Data collection took place over the period July 2012 to 
May 2013.

Design and randomization 
The study used a randomized controlled design. Participants were randomized in blocks 
consisting of eight participants, (four allocated to treatment, four allocated to controls). 
Randomization for each block was achieved by having an independent person place eight 
cards with either “Treatment” or “Control” (four of each one) written on them into opaque 
envelopes which were then sealed. At the completion of baseline testing, an envelope was 
selected and assigned to the next participant on a list of screened participants. A total of 16 
participants were randomly assigned to the treatment group and 15 to the control group. 
Materials and procedure 
The repetition-lag training procedure was broadly similar to that outlined by Lustig and 
Flegal (2008). Computer files that provided the repetition-lag training algorithm were 
kindly provided by Kristin Flegal. Words were sourced from the MRC Psycholinguistic 
database (located on UWA website http://www.psy.uwa.edu.au/mrcdatabase/uwa_mrc. 
htm). From this, word lists for the experiment were randomly generated via an Excel 
macro. Each list had 30 words and two lists were used for each round of training (30 
words to be studied, 30 words as lures). Word lists were balanced in terms of word length 
F(1,46) = .992, P = .489 and frequency F(1,46) = 1.232, P = .139. The experiment was 
generated using E-Prime software (version 2.0; Psychological Software Tools, Inc.). 
Within the constraints set by the lag-length, the rate of repeated lures was random, and 
was randomized uniquely for each participant. 
Each training session comprised four rounds of training with the exception of the final 
session which had three. Within each session there was an initial study phase where 30 
words were presented one at a time for 14 seconds each, followed by a test phase where

the studied words were re-presented, mixed in with non-studied lures. The lures were 
repeated at systematically varying intervals. All participants began with a lag of 1 + 2 (i.e., 
15 of the 30 lures were repeated after a lag of 1 intervening word, the other 15 lures were 
repeated following an interval of 2 words) and were able to work their way up to a 
maximum lag of 16 + 40. Instructions were given on-screen to think about the meaning of 
each word to help them remember it but participants were free to choose their own method 
of doing so. Participants were also warned that some words would be repeated in the test 
phase. To motivate participants, it was explained that the target to reach was a minimum 
of 85% studied words correctly recognized and 85% of unstudied words correctly 
rejected. Participants were instructed to write down their percentage score for both studied 
words and repeated lures on a scoresheet provided. However, 
the lag interval was 
programmed to increase each time participants were able to correctly reject repeated 
lures at the criterion level. Lags increased as follows: 1 + 2, 1 + 3, etc. At the end of each 
round percentage scores for both studied words and for lures were displayed on the 
screen. The lags for each level of training are displayed in Table 2. As initial piloting with 
a small sample (N = 4) of people with aMCI had indicated that the threshold levels of 
lures correctly rejected (96% and 93%) used in Lustig and Flegal (2008) to move up to the 
next lag were too high for this impaired group, modified criterion levels of 85% and 83% 
of unstudied words correctly rejected were used instead. 
After a practice round on the training task, training was then completed over the 
following six sessions. A final session was devoted to post-treatment measures. The 
control group attended twice to complete pre and post-treatment measures. 

The primary outcome measures comprised both immediate and delay scores from the 
Verbal Paired Associates Test (Wechsler Memory Scale – Fourth Edition, Wechsler, 
2009). While all participants had prior neuropsychological testing, none had previous 
exposure to this task. 
VPA I – This subtest assesses verbal memory for associated word pairs. After 10 word 
pairs are read to the participant, the first word of each pair is read and the participant is 
asked to provide the word that it was paired with. The same list of word pairs is presented 
over four trials, in a different order each time. If a participant responds incorrectly, the 
correct word pair is re-stated. Correct responses are affirmed (“That’s right”) by the 


examiner. Six of the word pairs are unrelated words, (e.g., “laugh-stand”) four of the 
word-pairs are related words (“sock-shoe”). Recall of unrelated word pairs was used as the 
measure of transfer of recollection. In our study, the score is the sum of correctly recalled 
unrelated word-pairs across all four trials. 
VPA II – The delayed condition assesses long-term recall of the word pairs. After a 
delay of 20–30 minutes, the first word of each pair is again read and the participant is 
asked to state the word that goes with it. Only a single trial is administered and no 
feedback is given during this test. 
Secondary outcome measures 
Symbol Span: taken from the Wechsler Memory Scale – Fourth Edition (Wechsler, 2009). 
This subtest assesses visual working memory using novel visual stimuli. Beginning with 
two symbols, abstract visual symbols are exposed for 5 seconds. In the test phase, the 
participant has to correctly recall not only the correct symbols from distractor items, but 
also the order in which they were presented from left to right. The number of symbols 
presented increases by one at intervals as the test progresses. Higher scores indicate better 
visual working memory. Responses to each item are scored either zero, one or two points 
in accordance with the manual and the total score is the sum of the item scores. 
Number Sequencing and Number-Letter switching: These tests are taken from the 
Delis–Kaplan Executive Function System Test Battery (D-KEFS; Delis, Kaplan, & 
Kramer, 2001) and mirror the well-known Trail Making Part A and Part B. In Number 
Sequencing, the participant is asked to draw a line connecting numbers in order from low 
to high as quickly as possible without making mistakes, and is a measure of attention. In 
Number-Letter switching, the task is to switch between connecting numbers and letters, in 
order, from lowest to highest, e.g., 1-A, 2-B, 3-C etc., and is a measure of cognitive 
flexibility. Data collected for each test is the time taken (seconds) to complete the task. 
Higher scores indicate poorer performance on these measures. 

functioning was measured by the Cognitive Failures 
Questionnaire (Broadbent, Fitzgerald, Cooper, & Parkes, 1982) which is a reliable and 
validated (Wallace, Kass, & Stanny, 2002) 25 item self-report measure of the frequency of 
various cognitive failures. In this study participants were asked to report on cognitive 
failures in the past week. Each item is scored on a five point scale indicating how often a 
specific problem has occurred ranging from 4 = “very often” to 0 = “never”. The scores 
are then added to arrive at a total score (Possible range 0–100). Higher scores indicate 
more frequent cognitive failures. 
Mood was measured using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (Lovibond & 
Lovibond, 1995) 21 item version. This shortened version has been shown to have excellent 
reliability (internal consistency for each subscale of at least .87) and concurrent validity, being 
highly correlated with well-established measures of depression and anxiety such as the Beck 
Depression Inventory and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Antony, Bieling, Cox, Enns, & 
Swinson, 1998). High scores indicate increased symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. 
Data analysis 
All analyses were carried out using SPSS Statistics – version 21. Planned analyses 
included the following: 








(4) Treatment effects were assessed using 2 (group) × 2 (pre and post) repeated 
measures ANCOVAs, for each of the primary and secondary outcome variables 
with diagnosis (single or multiple domain aMCI) included as a covariate. A 
treatment effect was defined as a significant group × time interaction. 

Training task data 
Data for hits, false alarms, accuracy and response bias are presented in Table 3. 
Training outcome 
To assess the effectiveness of recollection training, the RLT level reached (possible range 
1–11) after three rounds of the first training session (M = 1.41, SD = 0.66) was compared 
with the level reached by the end of the final session (M = 6.75, SD = 3.01) using a paired 
samples t-test. This showed a significant improvement in RLT level between the first and 
last day of training, t(11) =−6.65, P < .001. This indicates that participants improved on 
the task itself over the course of training. All participants were able to progress at least 
two further lag levels beyond the level reached at the end of the first session, and eight of 
the twelve participants progressed at least four levels. 
Accuracy 
To check that the task improvements were actually due to improved recollection rather 
than simply due to practice effects, i.e., increased accuracy, a one-way repeated measures 
ANOVA was conducted on accuracy across all six sessions of training. The results 
indicated no significant change in accuracy ratings over the course of training F 
(5,270) = .409, P = .842. 
Response bias 
As the probability of correct responses is not equally distributed between “yes” and “no” 
responses in our study, an analysis of response bias was conducted. There were 30 studied

words and 60 unstudied words (30 new and 30 repeated) implying that responding “yes” 
will be correct 1/3 of the time, while “no” will be correct 2/3 of the time. It could therefore 
be argued that changes on the task are not due to true improvements in recollection but 
merely reflect participants learning to press “no” more often. The statistic β was calculated 
as a measure of bias using the method outlined in Stanislaw and Todorov (1999). To 
assess for changes in response bias over the course of all six sessions of training a one- 
way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted on response bias as quantified by β. This 
indicated no systematic change in response bias by session F(5,270) = .615, P = .689. 
Outcome data 
All outcome variables were checked for outliers, normality and sphericity. There were no 
outliers detected using boxplots, and Mauchly’s test of Sphericity was non-significant in 
all cases. Where some variables were positively skewed, tests of skewness and kurtosis 
were within reasonable bounds (Skewness and kurtosis values were both within ± bounds 
set by multiplying std. error of the relevant statistic by two). 
Correlations between the baseline variables and the outcome measures were obtained. 
Baseline MMSE score was not significantly correlated with both primary outcomes and 
nor were other baseline variables such as age, years of education. While a chi-square test 
confirmed that diagnosis (single vs multiple domain aMCI) did not differ between groups 
χ2(2, N = 24) = 0.75, P = .38, point biserial correlations revealed that participants with 
single domain aMCI performed better on both primary outcomes as well as on a measure 
of cognitive flexibility, Number-Letter switching (correlations ranging from .413 to .423). 
It was then included in subsequent analyses as a covariate.

and interaction effects for all measures are provided in Table 5. On the measures of 
recollection, recall of unrelated word pairs immediately following presentation was not 
significantly affected by training. However, on the delayed measure, results of a repeated- 
measures ANCOVA revealed a significant group × time interaction with the training 
group improving their recall of unrelated word pairs, while the control group declined. 
The eta squared statistic (.17) indicated a modest effect size. Recall of related word-pairs 
(which were not expected to change) was not affected by training either immediately 
following presentation F(1,21) = 1.75, P = .200 or after a delay F(1,21) = .35, P = .361. 
Secondary outcomes 
There were no significant group by time interactions on measures of either attention or 
cognitive flexibility as measured by Number sequencing and Number-Letter switching. 
Nor was there a significant interaction on the measure of visual working memory (Symbol 
Span). Inspection of means suggested that the lack of significant group by time interac- 
tions on both Number sequencing and Symbol Span could have been due to low power, so 
further exploratory analyses were carried out. Paired samples t-tests revealed that for 
Symbol Span the training group improved their performance following training t 
(11) = −2.68, P = .021, while the control group did not t(11) = −.367, P = .720. 
Results for Number sequencing were non-significant for both groups. Both self-reported 
everyday cognitive failures and mood were unaffected by training, with no significant 
group by time interactions. 
Discussion 
To the author’s knowledge this is the first study using the modified RLT program 
described by Lustig and Flegal (2008) in a group of people with aMCI. The study builds 


on an existing body of research which suggests that RLT improves recollection on the task 
itself, and may also transfer to untrained measures. 
The modified RLT program proved effective as participants were able to increase the 
lag at which they could correctly discriminate unstudied from studied words to criterion 
levels of accuracy. These improvements cannot be attributed to practice effects nor to 
changes in response bias suggesting that training was effective at improving recollection 
on the task itself. Taken together, these findings suggest that the modified RLT procedure 
may be a robust method of training recollection in aMCI. 
This study aimed to test the efficacy of RLT in transferring to an untrained measure of 
recollection and found an improvement in delayed recall of unrelated word-pairs follow- 
ing training. This finding is preliminary and requires further research. However, it is 
notable as delayed recall is known to be significantly impaired in aMCI, more so than 
immediate recall (Perri et al., 2005) and problems with delayed recall are predictive of 
conversion to Alzheimer’s disease in memory clinic patients (Morris, Heyman, Mohs, & 
Hughes, 1989; Smith & Rush, 2006; Takayama, 2010). Thus, a group of aMCI partici- 
pants who are likely to be at increased risk of progression to dementia improved in an area 
of memory known to be impaired following just six sessions of RLT. However, the other 
primary outcome, immediate recall of unrelated word pairs, did not improve with training. 
While there are many differences in how the immediate and delayed trials of the VPA are 
administered and presumably in the cognitive processes engaged at these two phases, it is 
plausible to suggest that training effects occurred only on the delayed test because RLT 
emphasized delayed recollection over more short-term retention. The immediate recall 
task also appears to have been too sensitive to practice effects with both treatment and 
control groups improving. 
None of the secondary outcome measures showed strong evidence of transfer of 
training. Lustig and Flegal (2008) previously reported gains following RLT training on 
a measure of cognitive flexibility (Trails B). This was an unexpected finding and they 
it could be because RLT actually trains executive control processes 
speculated that 
mediated by the prefrontal cortex. However, it was not replicated in this study using a 
similar measure (Number-Letter switching) suggesting that it may have simply been an 
isolated finding. While previous research has reported gains in measures relating to 
working memory such as the Self-Ordered Pointing Test, n-back, and Digit Symbol 
Substitution Test (Jennings et al., 2005), we did not find strong evidence of transfer to 
a measure of visual working memory (Symbol Span), however there is evidence that this 
may have been due to low power. 
The self-report data showed no effect of training on either frequency of cognitive 
failures or on mood. As improvements in recollection are known to be related to everyday 
memory it was disappointing to observe no change in self-reported cognitive failures, 
despite training and transfer data indicating improved recollection. One possible reason is 
that the measure was not sensitive enough to memory lapses due to recollection failure, 
instead being designed to look at cognitive failures more generally (sample items include, 
“Do you have trouble making up your mind?” “Do you daydream when you ought to be 
listening?” “Do you drop things?” that may be unrelated to lapses in recollection). In our 
study mood was not affected by training. This suggests that while RLT did not boost 
mood, exposure to cognitive challenges via training does not appear to have an adverse 
effect on self-reported mood. 
This study had a number of strengths. It included independently diagnosed and 
objectively assessed aMCI participants who were re-screened on entry to the study. The 
study used a robust randomized controlled trial design to control for potential bias in 


observing treatment effects. Further, it made use of an established training procedure, 
optimized for older people and further adapted on the basis of piloting with an aMCI 
sample. The study was designed to test the hypothesis that RLT would improve recollec- 
tion not just on the task itself, but also transfer to an untrained measure of recollection. 
Primary outcome measures were carefully selected and a conservative number of analyses 
planned. Secondary analyses were conducted to assess the transfer to other cognitive 
domains reported in previous research and to provide some insight into the impact on 
frequency of cognitive failures in daily life. 
Despite these strong design features, several important qualifications remain. Firstly, 
although there were only a few outcome measures, a Type I error cannot be ruled out, and 
the results need to be replicated in a larger trial. Secondly, the size of the improvement is 
modest, and may not be clinically meaningful. On average following training participants 
were able to recall one more word pair than prior to training. Also, the improvement was 
not evenly distributed across all participants. A sub-group (those who scored 0 at baseline) 
did not improve, with the improvement occurring in those who scored between 1 and 5 at 
baseline. The other qualification is that a study of this size is necessarily limited in its 
ability to see effects (raised Type II error), due to low statistical power. Another limitation 
is that an active control group was not employed, meaning that the results could be due to 
factors such as experimenter contact. This latter concern is ameliorated by the finding that 
previous research with active control groups using RLT have found that recognition 
practice with an equivalent amount of contact time does not produce the same training 
or transfer gains as RLT (Boller et al., 2012). 
The effect of changing the criterion to move from one lag to another is uncertain. In 
piloting, four aMCI participants were unable to reach the criterion of 96% correct 
rejections after four rounds of training at entry level (lag interval of 1 + 2) so the threshold 
was reduced to 85%. In the training data this meant that all participants were able to 
progress to at least lag level 3 (2 + 4). An alternative to changing the criterion would have 
been to reduce the number of words in the studied list. However this was avoided as the 
extent of improvement on the RLT task itself in an aMCI group was unknown. Most 
studies reporting on this have used normal elderly participants, so reducing the number of 
words (which necessarily reduces the longest lag possible) may have created an artificial 
ceiling on training gains. This was borne out in our data where several participants 
reached the highest RLT level possible by completion of training. 
The findings here suggest that RLT may be useful for improving recollection in a 
group who are impaired in this ability. With the modified procedure, participants are 
encouraged to use deep meaning-based processing to encode novel stimuli in a way that 
should aid recollection. Ideally, future studies should assess transfer of recollection on a 
range of measures, including ones sensitive to everyday recollection failures experienced 
in aMCI. This may help to provide a clearer view as to which aspects of recollection 
memory are improved by RLT. Finally, the variable response to training highlights a need 
to further explore the role of impaired familiarity in response to training in aMCI. Studies 
with aMCI and Alzheimer’s disease groups have reported mixed findings with regard to 
whether or not familiarity is preserved. Some have reported problems with recollection 
alone (Guerdoux, Dressaire, Martin, Adam, & Brouillet, 2012; Serra et al., 2010), while 
others find problems with both recollection and familiarity (Ally, Gold, & Budson, 2009; 
Wolk, Signoff, & DeKosky, 2008). At the least, those who have impairments in familiarity 
(on top of problems with recollection) are likely to have more difficulty completing the 
RLT procedure. If so, the RLT procedure may need to be further adapted to cater for the 
level of impairment in familiarity at baseline, either by pre-training to improve familiarity, 


or by shortening the length of the word lists. Overall, there are several avenues to explore 
so that RLT can be more precisely targeted to the heterogeneous clinical presentations 
seen in aMCI.
