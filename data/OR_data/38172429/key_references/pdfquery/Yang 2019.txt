Background: memory training is a potential intervention for retaining memory and reducing dementia risk in older adults 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
Objective: this study examined the effect of virtual interactive working memory training (VIMT) in older adults with MCI. 
Design: single-blind, two-arm parallel-group, randomised controlled design. 
Setting: retirement homes, institutions, and communities. 
Subjects: a total of 66 older adults with MCI were recruited (mean age: 78.5 ± 7.6 years). 
Methods: participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (VIMT, n = 33) or active control group (n = 33). 
The VIMT program used the CogniPlus (includes four training modules). Both groups attended 45 min sessions 3 times 
per week, a total of 36 sessions. The primary outcome was working memory; secondary outcomes were immediate memory, 
delayed memory, subjective memory complaints and global cognitive function. All variables were measured at pre-test, post- 
test, and 3-month follow-up. 
Results: between group, the effect of working memory adjusted mean difference by 1.75 (95% CI: 0.56 to 2.94; P < 0.01) 
at post-test. The results were analysed by a generalised estimating equation, which indicated that VIMT group signiﬁcantly 
improved working memory at post-test (P = 0.01) relative to the active control group. 
Conclusions: the applied VIMT program can enable older adults with MCI to maintain their working memory and reduce 
the rate of cognitive deterioration. 
Trial registration: This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (no.: NCT02462135).

The risk of dementia is higher in older adults with Mild cog- 
nitive impairment (MCI) than in the general population, and 
the rate of conversion of MCI to dementia is estimated at 
5–20% [1]. Memory impairment is the most easily detected 
symptom of cognitive changes; thus, memory is a critical clin- 
ical representation of cognitive function decline [2]. 
Working memory is thought to be heavily dependent on 
attention-based processes and/or the storage to carry out 
tasks, and that’s been known generally considered a gateway 
between short-term memory and long-term memory [3, 4]. 
Immediate memory refers to the recall of information 
immediately after presentation and it is mainly used for 
measuring short-term memory. Delayed memory refers to 
the recall of material sometime after its presentation and is 
usually used for measuring long-term memory. Studies sug- 
gest that the risk of MCI and dementia in older adults with 
subjective memory complaints is 4.5 times higher than in 
those without such complaints; subjective memory com- 
plaints are also reported to be signiﬁcantly correlated with 
memory performance and global cognitive function [5–7]. 
Virtual interactive working memory training (VIMT) is 
relatively novel and scalable intervention that aims to main- 
tain memory in older adults. VIMT program is by means of 
training programs that simulate real-life situations, helps 
subjects to integrate their progress into everyday life using a 
typically without explicit 
multimedia approach. VIMT, 
teaching of memory or problem-solving strategies, which 
distinguish this training modus from other approaches for 
memory intervention. Recent meta-analyses of randomised 
controlled trials of memory intervention have found moder- 
ate effect sizes on cognition/memory in older adults [8–10]. 
A previous study indicated that 15–20% of older adults with 
MCI showed improvements in cognitive function or effective 
reductions in their risk of deteriorating cognitive function 
after receiving cognitive-related interventions performed 
1–2 years after MCI development [1]. 
Despite evidence that memory training is useful for 
deferring declines in memory function, previous studies 
have mostly recruited healthy older adults and not older 
adults with MCI. Furthermore, only 37% of previous mem- 
ory training studies were clinical trials and some did not 
provide detailed information regarding their randomisation 


and blinding [11–13].The effect of memory training on spe- 
ciﬁc memory functions has not been adequately discussed. 
The present 
trial was 
designed as an intervention study. The objective of this 
study was to examine the effects of a virtual 
interactive 
working memory training (VIMT) program on working 
memory, 
immediate memory, delayed memory, subjective 
memory complaints, and global cognitive function in older 
adults with MCI compared to an active control group. 


This study applied a randomised, single-blind, two-arm par- 
allel-group design to examine changes in working memory, 
immediate memory, delayed memory, subjective memory 
complaints, and global cognitive function in post-test and 
3-month follow-up between the two interventions. The 
Regional Ethics Review Board 
of Taipei Medical 
University’s Joint Institutional Review Board approved this 
study (approval no.:201301045). 

Older adults living in retirement homes, retirement institu- 
tions, or 
retirement communities were recruited and 
enroled as participants. All data were collected between 
August 2013 and July 2016. Inclusion criteria were: (1) self- 
reported subjective memory complaints; (2) detection of 
signiﬁcant memory impairment; (3) assessments of cogni- 
tive function using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA) (At an optimal cut-off of below 23 for MCI and 
below 17 for dementia) [14, 15] and (4) ability to perform 
activities of daily living independently (assessment using the 
Basic activities of daily living [BADL] and Instrumental 
activities of daily living [IADL]). Exclusion criteria were: 
(1) diagnosis of dementia; (2) severe mental disease or 
behavioural problems; (3) rapid decline in cognitive or 
physical function; (4) severe sensory function or commu- 
nicative impairment; and (5) receipt of related cognition 
or memory training in the preceding year. Before the 
screening, subjects were informed of the study goals and 
methods, and subjects who agreed to participate signed 
the study consent forms. After providing informed con- 
sent, participants were randomly assigned to either the 
experimental group (VIMT) or the active control group 
(Passive information activities [PIA]). 

The independent investigator generated a table of random 
numbers using a computer and used block randomisation 
(block size: 4), and placed the group assignment ﬁles in 
sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE) 
taken to conceal 
interventions were 
the sequence until 
assigned (allocation ratio = 1:1). Participants were informed 
beforehand that there were two intervention measures, they 
were not being able to determine whether they were ran- 
domly assigned to the VIMT group or the PIA group. The 
participants were not blinded, 
i.e. they knew what group 
they were allocated to and what treatment they were receiv- 
ing. The assessors cannot discuss any study information 
related to the participants with the therapists, and they do 
not know which participants are receiving a genuine treat- 
ment. The assessors only responsible for collecting data 
during the study. All were kept blindness about which 
group participants are in, until the data-collection phase of 
the end. 

Sample size was estimated using G-Power statistics software 
[16]. Participants were assigned either to the VIMT group 
or the PIA group (α = 0.05, power = 0.90, effect size = 
0.45, drop-out rate = 21%) [17, 18]. Hence, oversampling 
was performed to enrol 62 participants with MCI (i.e. 31 
participants per group). 

The VIMT program was used as an intervention in the pre- 
sent study. The VIMT program measures performance 
using CogniPlus software (Schuhfried GmbH, Vienna, 
Austria), which is a theory-based and scientiﬁcally-veriﬁed 
intelligent interaction system designed for training cognitive 
function. The training content was designed according to 
the working memory model [3, 4].The experimental group 
was subjected to a 45 min session 3 times per week for 12 
weeks, for a total of 36 sessions. The training programmes 
were implemented in an individual form. Each type of 
working memory training was conducted over nine sessions. 
The four working memory training modules applied in this 
study are as follows: 
(1) Updating—visual memory task: emphasises 
the 
training of the visual cache in the visual–spatial sketchpad. 
It is used to train the working memory monitoring function 
and improve the ability to retain information while continu- 
ously updating it. (2) Spatial encoding memory task: used to 
train and improve monitoring processes and spatial coding 
in the visual–spatial sketchpad. It is a basic working mem- 
ory mechanism that involves cognitive function control and 
coordination; it is regarded as the basis for complex cogni- 
(3) Rehearsal—visuospatial 
training task: 
tive processes. 

emphasises the training of the visual scribe in the visual– 
spatial sketchpad. (4) Updating—spatial memory task: used 
to train and improve the update function, a basic working 
memory mechanism that involves control and target stimu- 
lus repositioning. In this training module, three tasks must 
be completed, namely running memory, keep-track, and 
n-back. The four working memory training modules were 
performed in sequence (see the training content of the 
VIMT program in Appendix 1 of the online supplementary 
data). VIMT modules was used to improve rehearsal abil- 
ities and assist trainees to practice retrieval and re-encoding 
under self-control and attentional control. 
The active control group in the PIA intervention using a 
tablet computer. The contents of the control training pro- 
gram included reading online e-books and playing online 
games, such as puzzles, spot the differences, etc.…, and the 
training frequency was being identical (45 min sessions 3 
times per week for 12 weeks, a total of 36 sessions) [19]. 


The primary outcome was the working memory. Working 
memory was measured using the digit span (DS)—back- 
ward task to assess working memory [20]. Secondary out- 
comes were 
delayed memory, 
subjective memory complaints, and global cognitive func- 
tion. The immediate memory and delayed memory scores 
were calculated using the Wechsler Memory Scale—Third 
Edition (WMS-III) 
[20]. Immediate memory comprises 
immediate memory, auditory immediate memory, and visual 
immediate memory. Delayed memory comprises delayed 
memory, auditory delayed memory, and visual delayed 
memory. All scores were derived from age-standardised 
scores in the individual scales. Subjective memory complaints, 
which were determined using the Multifactorial Memory 
Questionnaire (MMQ). The MMQ consists of three subtests 
(ability, strategy, and contentment) [21]. Global cognitive func- 
tion was evaluated using the Mini-Mental Status Examination 
(MMSE) [22] and the MoCA [14, 15]. 

All analyses were performed according to the intention-to- 
treat (ITT) principle. Data from all randomly-assigned partici- 
pants were included in the ﬁnal statistical analysis [23, 24] and 
analysed using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 
Each participant had three time point measures: pre-test, 
post-test,and three-month follow-up. The data were analysed 
using independent t-tests and Chi-square tests. For all out- 
come measures, between-group differences in mean changes 
from baseline to each time point (post-test and three-month 
follow-up) were 
generalised estimating

was repeatedly measured using GEEs analysis, which were

Ninety-three adults participated in this study. Participants 
were randomly assigned to the VIMT group (n = 33) or 
PIA group (n = 33). The difference of age in baseline was 
adjusted using multivariate generalised linear models. No 
signiﬁcant differences were detected in other baseline data 
(Table 1). The total dropout rate of this study was 4.5%, 
1 (0.03%) participant from the VIMT group and 2 (0.06%) 
participants from the PIA group had dropped out. The rea- 
sons for dropping out were leaving the residence and hospi- 
talisation (Fig 1). None of the participants exhibited adverse 
reactions during the training. 

Table 2 presents the results of all outcome measures at pre- 
test, post-test, and three-month follow-up. At post-test, the 
VIMT group showed statistically signiﬁcant difference com- 
pared to the PIA group on working memory, subjective 
memory complaints (MMQ Strategy), and globe cognitive 
function (MMSE); At three-month follow-up, the VIMT 
group is statistically signiﬁcant different from the PIA 
group on the globe cognitive function (MoCA) (difference = 
2.27 points, 95% CI = 0.18 to 4.37, P = 0.03) (Table 2). 
The effectiveness of the interventions were observed in the 
GEE analysis results, where a signiﬁcant time × group inter- 
action effect was discerned in the effect of the VIMT program 
on post-test DS scores (P = 0.01), which were superior to 
those of the PIA group (Appendix 2 , available in Age and 
Ageing online). Therefore, VIMT engendered signiﬁcant 
improvements in working memory. The secondary outcome

speciﬁcally for older adults with MCI. Training software 
was applied to offer specialised training conditions depend- 
ing on each participant’s characteristics and enabled the 
researcher to immediately and objectively compare data 
using real-time feedback. Second, VIMT program is more 
cost-effective and personalised than traditional memory 
training. It is easy to operate. Subjects are required to press 
one button only to respond in the training procedure. Thus, 
the training doesn’t operate difﬁcult for older adults to 
accomplish and adapts task difﬁculty to individual perform- 
ance. Finally, this study applied a wide range of memory- 
related outcome measures for a detailed analysis of the 
effectiveness of intervention. This study has several limita- 
tions. The working memory training may beneﬁt older 
adults, but regarding training and transfer effects in older 
adults may be more complex and restricted compared with 
younger participants. Although an effective sample size was 
used in the study, 
the sample size should be further 
increased to examine the dose–response effect of training 
and transfer effects (e.g. training sessions, duration) [29, 30]. 
In addition, 
lack of blinding of participants in this study. 
Therefore, we were recommended that the groups are trea- 
ted as equally possible, such as provided the training fre- 
quency was being identical. 

(the VIMT program) 
applied in this study can be applied in institutions or commu- 
nities and incorporated into regular activities and long-term 
programmes to provide comprehensive care services to help 
delay the progression of cognitive and memory loss in older 
adults. Further research is required to conﬁrm these ﬁndings 
and establish if there is a clinically worthwhile beneﬁt.

subjective memory complaints and global cognitive function. 
The GEE analysis results did not show any effect of the 
VIMT program on all secondary outcomes at post-test and 
three-month-follow-up (Appendix 2 and 3, available in Age and 
Ageing online), but the means of these variables exhibited short- 
term stable trends and no signs of decline (Table 2). 

Working memory training relies on memory processes and 
strategies to strengthen recall capacity, which can be trained 
via two general mechanisms: enhanced working memory 
capacity or efﬁciency. Multiple factors may inﬂuence 
mechanisms mediating transfer effects and success of train- 
ing interventions, such as the training program and individ- 
ual differences [10, 11, 25]. Working memory is crucial for 
processing daily needs, particularly those needs pertaining 
to information retention, representations of cognitive pro- 
cessing, and task implementation, such as remembering a 
phone number or understanding long and difﬁcult sen- 
tences. DS-backward exhibited a higher correlation with 
working memory compared with DS-forward, as DS- 
backward requires individuals to recall a sequence in reverse 
order while coding the numbers that are heard, which is a 
relatively difﬁcult 
task. Immediate and delayed memory 
were found to be highly correlated with cognitive impair- 
ment; delayed memory was also conﬁrmed as an effective 
predictor of MCI progression to dementia. The results of 
the present study are consistent with previous ﬁndings, 
which concluded that memory training have signiﬁcant 
effects in older adults, suggesting that cognitive plasticity is 
preserved in old age [26–28]. However, participants of PIA 
group were signiﬁcantly older in this study, they may have 
exhibited lesser training gains and cognitive plasticity com- 
pared to VIMT group. 
In accordance with the Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, 
this rigorously 
designed study showed that working memory training (i.e. 
VIMT) can enable older adults with MCI to maintain their 
cognitive or memory status and reduce the rate of cognitive 
deterioration. By strengthening working memory, can help 
individuals memorise information more easily (e.g. phone 
numbers) when they are provided with information stimuli 
in daily settings. Older adults with MCI can further motiv- 
ate the continued acquisition of memory function and the 
use of new memory strategies by the training program. 
However, the study was followed only three-month follow- 
up, future studies were required with long term follow-up 
and more outcome measures of transfer effect, i.e. function, 
mood, quality of life, other cognitive domains such as: 
visuospatial abilities, attention etc…, which further veriﬁes 
the prevented progression to dementia and reduction of 
hazards in daily life. Booster sessions can be seen as one of 
the strategies to sustain the long-term effects of training. 
The main contributions of this study are as follows. First, 
this is the ﬁrst study in Chinese population to develop a
