Abstract.
BACKGROUND: There is no successful pharmacological treatment for cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s Disease,
therefore treatments capable of slowing down the progression of cognitive dysfunction are needed.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive training, supported by the CoRe computerized tool, in patients
with Parkinson’s Disease Mild Cognitive Impairment.
METHODS: This is a prospective, open-unblinded, randomized, controlled study. After baseline cognitive assessment (T0),
enrolled patients were randomized to receive motor rehabilitation plus cognitive intervention (G1) or motor rehabilitation
only (G2). Follow-up assessments were scheduled 4 weeks (T1) and 6 months after (T2). Global cognitive functioning scores
(MOCA and MMSE) were considered as primary outcome. Outcome measures at T0, T1 and T2 were compared within-
and between-groups. A percentage change score between T0 and next assessments was calculated to identify patients who
improved, remain stable or worsened.
RESULTS: Differently from G2, G1 showed a medium/large effect size improvement in primary (MoCA) and secondary
outcome, both between T0 and T1 and T0 and T2. Moreover, within G1, most patients improved their cognitive state compared
to the baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients trained with CoRe showed a better evolution of cognitive decline, while untreated patients tended
to get worse over time.
Keywords: Cognitive training, executive dysfunctions, parkinson’s disease, randomized controlled trial
1. Introduction
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is used to
describe cognitive deﬁcits that appear in the early
stage of the neurodegenerative diseases and repre-
sents a risk factor for the development of dementia
(Petersen et al., 1999). The MCI construct was intro-

duced also in Parkinson’s Disease (PD), similarly to
what happened in Alzheimer’s Dementia (AD) (Cavi-
ness et al., 2007; Litvan et al., 2012).
At present, there is no successful pharmacologi-
cal treatment for cognitive impairment in PD (Emre,
Ford, Bilgic¸, & Uc¸, 2014; Orgeta et al., 2015). An
extensive literature supports the beneﬁcial effects
of cognitive training (CT) in healthy elder peo-
ple (Lampit, Hallock, & Valenzuela, 2014), in MCI
and AD (Andrieu, Coley, Lovestone, Aisen, & Vel-
las, 2015; Coyle, Traynor, & Solowij, 2015; Rojas
et al., 2013). In the case of PD, evidence in favor

of the effectiveness of CT, using either computers
or in-person interventions, is still poor. A systematic
review and meta-analysis (Leung et al., 2015) iden-
tiﬁed only 7 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs).
Though these studies provided evidence on the effec-
tiveness of CT on cognition in PD patients, they
were based on small sample sizes and on different
modalities of CT. Therefore, larger RCTs or fur-
ther conﬁrmatory studies are necessary to examine
the usability and usefulness of CT programs as a
treatment for cognitive decline in PD. Moreover, it
is currently unknown whether CT affects cognition
on long term in PD, due to the lack of longitudinal
studies. Walton and colleagues (Walton, Naismith,
Lampit, Mowszowski, & Lewis, 2017) suggested two
options about the potential outcomes from CT in PD:
CT may brieﬂy stabilize cognitive decline, by delay-
ing the downward trajectory, or it can attenuate the
rate of decline. Furthermore, it is not clear whether
long-term effects of CT on both the above outcomes
are more likely obtained with booster sessions or with
long-term continued CT. In this regard, only one RCT
(Petrelli et al., 2015) provided a follow-up assessment
after 1 year in PD patients with normal cognitive pro-
ﬁle, in order to study the conversion process to MCI.
The authors observed that patients who received a
6-weeks CT program maintained their overall cog-
nitive functions, while those in the control group
showed a signiﬁcant decline. Moreover, some stud-
ies (Coyle et al., 2015; Walton et al., 2017) suggested
that computerized CT may be efﬁcacious at the early
phases of PD, or where PD-MCI is present, while
it may not be beneﬁcial at the Parkinson’s Disease
Dementia stage.
Computer-supported CT delivery overcomes some
limits of traditional paper-and-pencil approach. In
fact, computerized CT uses engaging motivational
cues and provides real-time feedback; task com-
plexity and response time demands may change
frequently during and across sessions, in accordance
with changes in individual performance. This allows
avoiding over- or under-stimulation and providing
more training time in areas of relative weakness.
Computer support also saves time for therapists in
the preparation of the exercises and allows to record
all session parameters for further statistics.
In the light of this background, we conducted a
prospective, open-unblinded RCT in order to assess
the effectiveness of a computer-based CT (CoRe
system) for the training of logical and executive func-
tions in inpatients with PD-MCI. The study did not
include a control group treated with paper-and-pencil
approach since, for the advantages of the computer
supportexplainedabove,wegavefor granted thenon-
inferiority of a computerized rehabilitation program
vs a traditional one.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants and measures
Inpatients with idiopathic PD were recruited from
the Neurorehabilitation Unit of the IRCCS Mondino
Foundation. Inclusion criteria were:
– diagnosis
of
idiopathic
PD
according
to
UKPDBB criteria (Hughes, Daniel, Kilford, &
Lees, 1992) and Hoehn & Yahr scale ≤4 (Hoehn
& Yahr, 1967);
– presence of PD-MCI single-domain (executive)
or PD-MCI multiple-domain with executive
involvement (Litvan et al., 2012);
– age between 50 and 85 years;
– education level ≥5 years.
Exclusion criteria:
– pre-existing cognitive impairment (e.g. aphasia,
neglect);
– severe disturbances in consciousness;
– severe sensory or motor disturbances that do not
allow the patient to control the trunk or to main-
tain the sitting position; in particular patients
withdisturbingrestingand/oractiontremor(cor-
responding to score 2–4 in the speciﬁc items
of Uniﬁed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS III) (Fahn,1987) were excluded;
– concomitant severe psychiatric or neurological
conditions;
– patients with Deep Brain Stimulation.
All the patients were treated with dopamine ago-
nists or L-DOPA; the therapy was stable for 3 months
and no variations were allowed during the training
and follow-up periods. The disease severity was rated
according to the Hoehn & Yahr Scale and UPDRS III.
The PD-MCI diagnosis was formulated on the
basis of a comprehensive neuropsychological eval-
uation (baseline cognitive assessment) according to
the guidelines (level II criteria) (Litvan et al., 2012);
the following standardized tests assessing different
domains were administered:
– global cognitive function: Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) (Folstein, Folstein, &

McHugh, 1975) and Montreal Montreal Overall
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (Nasreddine
et al., 2005);
– memory: verbal (Verbal Span, Digit Span) and
spatial (Corsi’s block-tapping test – CBTT)
span (Spinnler, 1987); verbal long-term memory
(Logical Memory Test immediate and delayed
recall) (Carlesimo, Caltagirone, Gainotti, &
Nocentini, 1995), (Rey’s 15-word test imme-
diate and delayed recall) (Caffarra, Vezzadini,
Dieci, Zonato, & Venneri, 2002); spatial long-
term memory (Rey Complex Figure delayed
recall – RCF-dr) (Laiacona, Inzaghi, De Tanti,
& Capitani, 2000);
– logical-executive functions: non-verbal reason-
ing(Raven’sMatrices1947–RM47)(Carlesimo
et al., 1995); categorical abstract reasoning
(Weigl’s Sorting test) (Spinnler, 1987); frontal
functionality (Frontal Assessment Battery –
FAB) (Apollonio et al., 2005); semantic ﬂuency
(animals, fruits, car brands), phonological ﬂu-
ency (FAS) (Carlesimo et al., 1995);
– attention: visual selective attention (Attentive
Matrices) (Carlesimo et al., 1995); simple
speed processing and complex attention (Trail
Making Test parts A - TMTA and part B
- TMTB) (Giovagnoli et al., 1996); selective
attention/susceptibility to interference (Stroop
test) (Amato et al., 2006);
– visuospatial abilities: Rey Complex Figure copy
– RCF-copy (Laiacona et al., 2000).
The same battery was also used at follow-up visits;
parallel versions were applied when available (ver-
bal long-term memory tests), in order to avoid the
learning effect. All the test scores were corrected for
age, sex, and education and compared with the values
available for the Italian population.
At the baseline, the patients’ functional status was
assessed using Activities of Daily Living (ADL)
(Lawton, 1988), to evaluate basic everyday activ-
ities (the score ranges from 0 to 6, with higher
scores corresponding to higher levels of indepen-
dence) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living
(IADL) (Lawton, 1969), to evaluate more complex
activities (the score ranges from 0 to 8, with higher
scores corresponding to higher levels of indepen-
dence). Score indicates preserved functions.
Moreover, mood were assessed using the Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck, Steer, & Brown,
2010) at the baseline and at the follow-up visits, while
quality of life were assessed using 8-Item Parkinson’s
Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) (Jenkinson & Fitz-
patrick, 2007) at the baseline and six months after
training.
The sample size has been calculated on the basis of
the global cognitive functioning measured by MoCA,
which is more sensitive to executive dysfunction in
PD with respect to MMSE. We considered a basal
value of MoCA equal to 24.9 ± 3.5, as reported in
Hu and colleagues (Hu et al., 2014). We considered
as a clinical signiﬁcant improvement an increase of
3 points. Using a statistical signiﬁcance threshold of
0.05 for type-1 error and a study statistical power of
80%, we obtained a sample size of 21 patients for
group.
The study was approved by the local Ethics Com-
mittee and conducted in accordance with the Helsinki
Declaration of 1975; all the participants provided
written Informed Consent.
2.2. Study design and procedures
This study is a prospective, open-unblinded RCT.
All the PD patients recruited underwent base-
line cognitive assessment (T0). Patients who met
the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled
and randomized to receive standard physical reha-
bilitation plus cognitive intervention with CoRe
(intervention group - G1) or standard physical reha-
bilitation only (control group - G2). The standard
physical rehabilitation was the same in the two groups
in terms of frequency, duration and number of ses-
sions. Standard physical rehabilitation comprises:
cardiovascular warm-up activities, active and pas-
sive exercises to improve the joints’ range of motion,
stretching of the abdominal muscles, strengthen-
ing of paravertebral muscles, postural changes, and
exercises operating on balance and postural control.
Neuropsychological evaluation and CoRe sessions
were administered exclusively during “on” status.
The randomization list was generated using a sim-
ple randomization method with “random number
generator” software. CoRe program consisted of 12
individual sessions (3 sessions/week) each lasting 45
minutes of computer-based logical-executive tasks.
All the patients were evaluated at the end of the
4-weeks training (T1) to detect the presence of a train-
ing effect (T0 vs T1) and subsequently at six months
from the end of CT (T2) to assess the persistence of
the training-related improvement (T1 vs T2). We will
also evaluate the medium-term impact of CT on the
evolution of cognitive decline (comparative changes
observed at T2 with respect to T0 in the two groups).

2.3. The CoRe system
CoRe (acronym for Cognitive Rehabilitation) is
an ontology-based software tool that allows several
degrees of personalization and the possibility to gen-
erate different patient-tailored exercises. The stimuli
database is created starting from the ontology, which
describes every entity trough a set of attributes and its
relation with other entities (a detailed description of
the ontology can be found in Leonardi, Panzarasa, &
Quaglini, 2011). This ontology improves the variety
and the personalization of the exercises, which play a
vital role in reducing the risk of boredom and increas-
ing the compliance. The exercises administered in
this study are the following ones in brackets the spe-
ciﬁc executive sub-abilities involved are described
(for a more detailed description see previous papers
(Alloni et al., 2017; Alloni, Quaglini, Panzarasa, Sin-
foriani, & Bernini, 2018):
1. FIND THE CATEGORY: the patient must
choose, between three textual options, the
belonging category of the three images
displayed (categorical thinking, conceptual
abstraction abilities);
2. FIND THE INTRUDER: ﬁve words are
displayed, four of which belong to the
same category, the patient must identify the
“intruder” element that belongs to a different
category (verbal-logical reasoning, cognitive
ﬂexibility, problem solving);
3. UNSCRAMBLE THE SENTENCE: scram-
bled words are displayed; the patient must
select them in the right order to compose a
sensible sentence (mental and verbal planning
and conceptual abstraction abilities);
4. UNSCRAMBLE THE IMAGES: the same as
above, the patient must put the scrambled
images in the right order to form a short story
(planning of activities, problem solving, tem-
poral sequencing, visual attention);
5. IMAGE AND SOUND: an image (small or
big) is displayed and a sound (with low or
high volume) is played; the patient must
evaluate whether size and volume match
(inhibitory control, multi-tasking, working-
memory, maintenance of attention over time);
6. WORD COUPLING: eight words are dis-
played, the patient must associate them in four
couples, identifying the relations that exist
between the stimuli (verbal-logical reasoning
based on previous knowledge);
7. LOGICAL SEQUENCES: a sequence of
images is shown, the patient must select,
among several options, the one that completes
the series (non-verbal reasoning, mental prob-
lem solving, decision making);
8. LOGICAL ANALOGIES: a “textual propor-
tion” is shown with one of the four elements
missing and named as X (ELEMENT#1 is
related to ELEMENT#2 as ELEMENT#3 is
related to X); the patient must identify the rela-
tion and select the right element among the
proposed options (logical reasoning, concep-
tual abstraction abilities);
9. FIND THE ELEMENTS: a matrix of ran-
dom text elements (letters or numbers) is
displayed, the patient must identify and select
the requested ones (sustained and selective
attention, visuo-spatial scanning, speed);
10. FUNCTIONAL PLANNING: the patient must
select, among the proposed options, the ele-
ments needed to perform the action displayed
(mental planning, decision making).
11. CoRe was previously tested on healthy vol-
unteers with different education levels and
different degree of familiarity with PC (Alloni
et al., 2017). Moreover, preliminary data from
the trial described in this paper were used
to verify the overall system functionality and
usability (e.g., in terms of completed sessions),
as well as to obtain initial results on its effec-
tiveness (Alloni et al., 2018).
2.4. Statistical analysis
Our hypothesis was that subjects in G1 had a higher
probability of maintaining or improving their cog-
nitive level than subjects in G2. The scores of the
neuropsychologicaltestswereconsidered asoutcome
measures. Particularly, the primary outcome mea-
sures were the global cognitive functioning scores
(MoCA and MMSE), while the secondary outcome
measures were the executive tests scores. Moreover,
non-executive test scores were also considered, as
explorative outcomes, to assess whether the treat-
ment effect could be transferred even into untrained
domains. The effects of the training measured at
T0, T1 and T2 were compared within- and between
groups. Considering the small sample size, normal-
ity tests cannot be expected to give reliable results,
so non-parametric tests are to be preferred. There-
fore, Friedman’s analysis of variance has been used
to compare the data obtained in the three cognitive

assessments, while Wilcoxon test was used to per-
form the group-group evaluations (T0vsT1, T1vsT2,
T0vsT2).Aneffectssizeindex(Cohen’sd)wascalcu-
lated to measure the magnitude of the treatment effect
for each signiﬁcant difference. Contingency tables
were used to investigate the association between the
intervention and the improvement (Fisher’s exact
test).
In order to detect the impact of CT on primary out-
comes, for both groups, the mean percentage change
scores for MMSE and MoCA were calculated and
compared between the baseline and the next eval-
uations (Wilcoxon test). Moreover, as suggested by
Binetti and colleagues (Binetti et al., 2013) for each
patient, the percentage change of the two primary
outcomes at T1 and T2 with respect to the base-
line value at T0 were calculated, i.e. 100x(T1 score
- T0 score)/(T0 score), and 100x(T2 score - T0
score)/(T0 score). Patients with a percentage change
equal to 0 were considered as being stable, those
with a percentage change greater than 0 were consid-
ered as improved; all the other patients were deﬁned
as non-responders, as described also in Petrelli’s
study (Petrelli et al., 2015). This allowed to identify
and compare (Fisher’s Test) the number of patients
who improved, retained or worsened their cognitive
state in the two groups between T0 and T1 and T0
and T2.
When two groups are compared, the results are
commonly considered signiﬁcant for p-values lower
than 0.05. However, since we also compared the
same variable at different times, and performed a
number of tests on multiple endpoint variables, we
adopted the FDR (false discovery rate) correction
method described in (Benjamini & Yekutieli, 2001).
We applied the correction both for the comparisons
at different times, and for the three time measures of
the multiple endpoints.
All statistical analyses were performed using R
(https://www.r-project.org/).
3. Results
Seventy-seven PD patients were recruited. Out of
them, 36 were excluded because they did not meet
the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The main reasons
for exclusion were absence of cognitive impairment,
presence of MCI without executive involvement, PD
dementia or Deep Brain Stimulation.
Among the 41 patients enrolled, 23 patients
were randomly assigned to G1 (7M/16F, mean
age 71.18 ± 7.04 years, mean education 9.06 ± 4.51
years) and 18 to G2 (11M/7F, mean age 69.33 ± 7.72
years, mean education 7.67 ± 3.50 years). Within G1,
6 patients dropped-out because they were discharged
from the hospital before the end of CT program,
therefore statistical analysis considered 17 patients
in G1 and 18 in G2 (see CONSORT diagram in
Fig. 1). In G1 11/17 and in G2 10/18 patients pre-
sented a prevalent rigid-akinetic form, while 6/17
and 8/18 respectively a prevalent tremorigenic form.
Four patients (2 in G1 and 2 in G2) presented a
moderate freezing. No patients presented impulsive-
compulsive disorders or hallucinations. Moreover,
patients with executive-single-domain PD-MCI were
2/17 in G1 and 2/18 in G2 respectively, the remain-
ingpatientspresentedmultiple-domainPD-MCIwith
executive involvement.
The demographic and clinical characteristics and
the mean neuropsychological scores at T0 are
reported in Table 1; no baseline differences were
found between the two groups. Table 2 shows the
mean (SD) neuropsychological scores and clini-
cal data at T1 and T2; Table 3 shows the results
(Wilcoxon test) of the intra-group and inter-group
comparisons of the neuropsychological scores at T0,
T1, T2. The results are presented with the indication
of the signiﬁcance with correction for the compar-
isons at different times (*) and for multiple endpoints
(∗∗).
Comparison between T0 and T1
– within-group analysis:
G1 showed statistically signiﬁcant improvements
at MoCA, Rey’s 15-word test immediate recall, Log-
ical Memory Test immediate recall, Weigl’s Test and
FAS, while G2 showed no statistically signiﬁcant
changes compared to the baseline scores.
– between-group analysis:
G1 performed signiﬁcantly better than G2 at
MoCA, Rey’s 15-word test immediate recall, Logical
Memory Test immediate recall, Weigl’s Test, TMTA,
RM47and Stroop Test time interference.
Comparison between T1 and T2
– within-group analysis:
G1 showed a signiﬁcant worsening at MoCA and
FAS.
G2 showed signiﬁcant worsening at MoCA and
FAS similarly to G1, but also at MMSE and FAB.

cant differences in the test scores variations between
the groups.

No signiﬁcant difference between the performance

in G2 most patients maintained their performance
between T0 and T1 and worsened between T0 and
T2.
As by the UPDRS III, both groups showed statisti-
cally signiﬁcant motor improvement between T0 and
T1 (G1 p < 0.04; G2 p < 0.05), while there was no
signiﬁcant difference in the scale variations between
the groups at T1 (Table 1). With regard to the mood,
there was no signiﬁcant group difference in BDI score
between the baseline and the follow-up visits. No dif-

4. Discussion
This prospective, open-unblinded RCT aimed to
evaluate the effectiveness of a CT supported by a
computerized tool (CoRe system) in PD-MCI. The
analysis of the results allows to draw several consid-
erations.
Cognitive intervention had positive effects imme-
diately after the end of training. G1 patients showed a
medium/large effect size improvement in the overall
cognitive performance score measured by MoCA (a
primary outcome measure) and in many executive
tests (secondary outcome measures). Furthermore,
inter-group analysis conﬁrmed that the improvement
in G1 was statistically different from G2 in several
executive and non-executive tests. Since the training
tasksdifferedfromthetestsusedduringtheneuropsy-
chological assessments and parallel test versions
were used, when available, on post-assessment, these
results may reﬂect learning of appropriate strategies
rather than simple practice effects.
A follow-up evaluation was scheduled 6 months
after the end of the training, with the aim of detect-
ing (1) if post-training improvement was maintained
over time and (2) how CT affects the evolution of
cognitive decline in medium-term. About the ﬁrst
aim, comparing the post-training assessment with the
last follow-up assessment, G1 behaved as G2 and
no post-training improvement was maintained six
months later. We can conclude that the beneﬁts of
the training are evident immediately afterward but
not at the six-month follow-up. The reason is prob-
ably related to the duration of the training program.

Literature suggests that the executive functions need
to be continuously stimulated over time since training
has a strong impact in the short term but not proba-
bly enough to maintain efﬁcient functioning in the
long term (Moro et al., 2015). A possible solution
would be to increase the number of weekly sittings
during the period of treatment and then encour-
age the patient to continue the treatment at home
(Alloni et al., 2018). To this concern, Walton and col-
leagues (Walton et al., 2017) highlighted the possible
role of boosters or additional CT after completion
to maintain the CT beneﬁt. Regarding the second
aim, both the intra- and the inter-group comparisons
showed that after seven months G1 performance was

signiﬁcantly better than the baseline in global
cognitive functioning measured by MoCA and in
several executive and non–executive test. As PD
is a chronic progressive disease, the worsening
observed in G2 can be interpreted as a cognitive pro-
ﬁle modiﬁcation due to natural disease evolution,
while G1 showed a better evolution of cogni-
tive decline, probably as a result of the cognitive
intervention.
Moreover, we can observe that, even if CoRe
focused on executive functions, the post-training
effects observed in our patients seem to be transferred
also into untrained domains, such as memory, thus
suggesting the presence of a generalization effect.
In fact, as suggested by Moro and colleagues (Moro
et al., 2015), a training concerning cognitive strate-
gies (e.g. task planning, inhibition of interference,
and divided attention) seems to have some impact
on the organization of the information that a patient
must remember, with a positive secondary effect on
memory.
In order to have a global measure of cognitive
functioning we used both MMSE and MoCA. While
the former is the most commonly used test in the
literature, it is known that the latter is more sen-
sitive and adequate to investigate logical-executive
dysfunctions in PD (Burdick et al., 2014; Dalrymple-
Alford et al., 2010). As a matter of fact, in our study
we observed a change in MOCA but not in MMSE.
In fact, comparing the baseline with the post-training
assessments, within G1 the global cognitive func-
tioning measured by MoCA signiﬁcantly improved,
as opposed to the decline in the control group. This
improvement was more consistent immediately after
the end of the training and decreased over time, but
even after seven months the performance was higher
than the baseline. Furthermore, the percentage of
patients that improved, remained stable, or worsened
at MoCA between the baseline and the next evalua-
tions, was signiﬁcantly different in the two groups:
in G1 most patients improved their global cogni-
tive level, while in G2 most patients maintained their
global cognitive level between T0 and T1 and wors-
ened between T0 and T2.
A comparison of our results with the literature is
difﬁcult because, to date, few studies used a global
measure of cognitive functioning in the analysis of
CT effects. Par´ıs (Par´ıs et al., 2011) did not ﬁnd
signiﬁcant effects on overall cognitive functions,
measured by ACE and MMSE, while Petrelli (Petrelli
et al., 2015) reported long-term effect after one year
using MMSE and Dem Tect. Further RCTs with
comparable global cognitive tests and longer follow-
up intervals are needed.
Moreover, some studies explored the interplay
between motor and cognitive aspects in PD reha-
bilitation. For example, a study suggested that
rehabilitative approaches involving cognition appear
to be the most effective and permit to achieve motor
beneﬁts (Ferrazzoli et al., 2018). Other studies sug-
gested that the combination of physical activity and
cognitive exercises may improve cognitive function
(memory and executive functions) in MCI (Teixeira
et al., 2012). A systematic review (Murray, Sacheli,
Eng, & Stoessl, 2014) suggested that physical exer-
cise improved not only motor symptoms, but also
cognitive impairments in PD; but the extent to which
physical exercise speciﬁcally impacts cognition in
PD, and how, is unclear. In our study, comparing the
UPDRS III scores between the baseline and the end of
physical rehabilitation program, both groups signiﬁ-
cantly improved and the size of this improvement was
similar; so we can conclude that no signiﬁcant effect
of CT on motor performance was observed. Further-
more, in our study only patients who also received
CT showed a better evolution of cognitive decline,
while patients who received motor rehabilitation only
tended to get worse over time. Therefore, our results
do not allow to hypothesize the presence of correla-
tion between motor and cognitive performances.
In conclusion, CoRe seems to be an effective treat-
ment in PD-MCI in the attempt of brieﬂy stabilizing
cognitive decline, delaying the downward trajectory
as suggested by Walton (Walton et al., 2017).
We are aware that this study has some limitations.
First of all, we were not able to analyze the num-
ber of patients (also because of drop-outs) calculated
from the sample size estimation. Thus, the statistical
power of the study slightly decreased. On the other
hand, our study is a prospective, open-unblinded RCT
performed on a homogeneous sample and we believe
that these characteristics balance the relatively small
sample size.
The follow-up interval was limited to 6 months;
however, to date few RCTs published follow-up data
of CT intervention in PD (Leung et al., 2015) and
onlyonewithalonger(12months)follow-up(Petrelli
et al., 2015). Therefore, the present data provide a
solid stepping stone for future RCTs and appear to
be largely conﬁrmatory that CT is safe and mod-
estly effective on cognition in patients with PD as
also suggested by Leung et al (Leung at al., 2015).
It should also be clariﬁed that the goal of this study
is not to demonstrate that computerized cognitive

S. Bernini et al. / Cognitive training in Parkinson’S disease
training with CoRe is better than traditional paper
and pencil cognitive training. Our results, in addition
to conﬁrming that cognitive training is helpful in PD,
allow to suggest that, in the hospital setting, the use of
a computerised version of the exercises offers bene-
ﬁts both for the operator and the patient: ﬁrst, the
possibility for an operator to follow more patients
simultaneously, with consequent saving in time and
costs; second, the availability of all the data, stored
in electronic format, related to the rehabilitation ses-
sions, which allow to perform sound statistics both at
individual and aggregated level; third, the possibility
for the patients to continue the treatment even after
discharge.
In the light of an approach characterized by com-
bination treatments for neurodegenerative disorders,
our data suggest that CoRe could be incorpo-
rated into clinical routine and recommended as a
non-pharmacological complementary therapy, to be
implemented also at home in order to maintain its
beneﬁts over time (Alloni et al., 2018). Core is cur-
rently a research tool, open for sharing experiences
with other health professionals. Our next step is to
use it as a telerehabilitation tool, for the provision of
remote rehabilitation treatments to home-patients.
