Background: Computerized multi-model training has been widely studied for its eﬀect on delaying cognitive
decline. In this study, we designed the ﬁrst Chinese-version computer-based multi-model cognitive training for
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Neuropsychological eﬀects and neural activity changes assessed by
functional MRI were both evaluated.
Method: MCI patients in the training group were asked to take training 3–4 times per week for 6 months.
Neuropsychological and resting-state fMRI assessment were performed at baseline and at 6 months. Patients in
both groups were continuously followed up for another 12 months and assessed by neuropsychological tests
again.
Results: 78 patients in the training group and 63 patients in the control group accomplished 6-month follow-up.
Training group improved 0.23 standard deviation (SD) of mini-mental state examination, while control group
had 0.5 SD decline. Addenbrooke's cognitive examination-revised scores in attention (p = 0.002) and memory
(p = 0.006), as well as stroop color-word test interference index (p = 0.038) and complex ﬁgure test-copy score
(p = 0.035) were also in favor of the training eﬀect. Diﬀerence between the changes of two groups after training
was not statistically signiﬁcant. The fMRI showed increased regional activity at bilateral temporal poles, insular
cortices and hippocampus. However, diﬀerence between the changes of two groups after another 12 months was
not statistically signiﬁcant.
Conclusions: Multi-model cognitive training help MCI patients to gained cognition beneﬁt, especially in memory,
attention and executive function. Functional neuroimaging provided consistent neural activation evidence.
Nevertheless, after one-year follow up after last training, training eﬀects were not signiﬁcant. The study pro-
vided new evidence of beneﬁcial eﬀect of multi-model cognitive training.
1. Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops from preclinical state, mild cog-
nitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. The prevalence of MCI ranges
from 3% to 20% in adults over 65 years old (Gauthier et al., 2006; Jia
et al., 2014; Ravaglia et al., 2008). However, approximate 50% of MCI
patients (roughly 12% per year) will progress to AD in the following
4–5 years. Dementia due to AD has caused a high medical and economic
burden on both community and families. If any interventions could
delay disease onset or slow its progression by 1 year, there would be
much fewer cases in 2050 with reduction by nearly 9.2 million, and
thus less expenditure on care and treatment (Brookmeyer et al., 2007).
Non-pharmacological interventions have shown advantages in de-
laying cognitive ability declining (Li et al., 2017). There are various
approaches, including cognitive training, physical exercise, and diet
modiﬁcation (Olazaran et al., 2010; Buschert et al., 2010). One famous

large-scale, randomized trial (the Advanced Cognitive Training for In-
dependent and Vital Elderly study, ACTIVE) in 2001 (Jobe et al., 2001)
had three models of cognitive training: speed of processing, memory,
and reasoning. Each intervention modiﬁed the corresponding ability,
and the eﬀect existed for 2 years. Donostia longitudinal study designed
a structured training program covering the cognitive functions of at-
tention, orientation, memory, language, visuo-constructive ability, ex-
ecutive functions, visuo-manual coordination, and praxis. The group
that received structured intervention got higher scores in nearly all
cognitive tests (Buiza et al., 2008).
Fewer cognitive interventions were specially designed for MCI pa-
tients. Memory training helped better memory performance in the fol-
lowing six months after training (Rapp et al., 2002). Rozzini et al.
treated a group of MCI patients with cognitive training and cholines-
terase inhibitors (ChEIs), and these patients showed greater improve-
ment in memory, abstract reasoning, and behavioral disturbances than
the only ChEIs group (Rozzini et al., 2007). Computerized cognitive
training has been considered as a convenient and ﬂexible method to
protect cognition (Barban et al., 2016). A meta-analysis suggested its
eﬃcacy on global cognition, select cognitive domains, and psychosocial
functioning for MCI patients (Hill et al., 2017).
Regarding the potential neural mechanism, it is suggested that
cognitive training would modulate neural plasticity by measuring re-
gional oxygen consumption or neural synchronization (Li et al., 2016;
Hotting et al., 2013; Chapman et al., 2015). These results were based on
healthy elders, while neural mechanism for MCI needs more evaluation.
In this study, we designed the ﬁrst Chinese-version computerized
cognitive training for MCI patients. The training program comprised
eight separate tasks: visual working memory, 30-second memory, epi-
sodic memory, speed of calculation, visual search, alertness, mental
rotation, and images re-arrangement task. Both neuropsychological and
neuroimaging assessments were performed to explore the training ef-
fect and related neural activities.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Study design and patients
The study was a randomized controlled pilot trial in Rui Jin Hospital
aﬃliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine,
Shanghai, China. All patients were screened by the Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE, Chinese Version) (Katzman et al., 1988), Zung
Self-rating Anxiety Scale and Zung Self-rating Depression scale ﬁrstly.
According to ATN criteria for MCI due to AD, our diagnosis was based
on a detailed medical history, neurological examinations, global score
of clinical dementia rating scale (global score = 0.5) (Morris, 1997) and
medial temporal lobe atrophy (Alberta et al., 2011). Exclusion criteria
included
evidence
of
stroke,
Parkinson's
disease,
human
im-
munodeﬁciency virus infection, and mood problems, as well as treat-
ment with benzodiazepines, antipsychotic or antiepileptic medications.
Patients with poor vision or hearing were also excluded.
We recruited MCI patients from January 2016 to December 2016,
and the last MCI patient was enrolled on December 20, 2016. A total of
160 MCI patients were ﬁnally enrolled in Shanghai. They were rando-
mized to the training or control group. All patients were of unrelated
Chinese Han descent with > 6 years of education. In order to minimize
Hawthorne eﬀect (McCarney et al., 2007), both groups were told the
study purpose as observation, follow-up and early diagnosis. Only the
training group was given the information about computer-based cog-
nitive training.
Neuropsychological assessment was done at baseline, 6-month, and
18-month. Baseline demographics included gender, age, education
level, occupation, concomitant diseases, and medications. A validated
neuropsychological battery for multiple cognitive domains was per-
formed by trained researchers (Y. Qiao and YZ. Lu) who were blind to
grouping. It included the Chinese version of Addenbrooke's cognitive
examination-revised (ACER) (Fang et al., 2014), the auditory verbal
learning test (AVLT)-Huashan version (Zhao et al., 2012), the shape
trail test (STT, including Part A and B) (Zhao et al., 2013), the Rey-
Osterrieth complex ﬁgure test (CFT) (Zhao et al., 2015), symbol digit
substitution test (SDS), and the Stroop Color-Word Test (SCWT).
After six-month training, some patients in the training group

stopped training and tended to be followed up continuously (Fig. 1).
During the follow-up period, medications for dementia (cholinesterase
inhibitors or memantine) were not prescribed.
Our study received ethical approval from the Research Ethics

Tong
University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. Informed consent was
obtained from all patients. The study was registered with Chinese Trial
Registry.gov (Register number: ChiCTR-IPR-16008383).
2.2. MRI acquisition and processing
At baseline and 6-month, repeated magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) was performed for neuroimaging evaluation. High-resolution T1-
weighted fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGR) sequence was acquired on
a 3.0 Tesla MR system (GE Signa HDxt; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI)
equipped with an eight-channel phased array head coil at the depart-
ment of radiology (sagittal slice orientation; matrix = 256 × 256; re-
petition time = 5.5 ms; echo time = 1.7 ms; inversion time = 450 ms;
ﬂip angle = 12°; voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm3). Resting-state blood
oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI using echo planar imaging (EPI)
weighted sequence (210 functional images, sagittal slice orientation;
35/37/39 slices; slice thickness = 4.0 mm; matrix = 64 × 64; repeti-
tion time = 2000 ms; echo time = 30 ms; ﬂip angle = 90°; voxel
size = 3.75 × 3.75 × 4 mm3) was also performed at baseline and 6-
months if patients consented.
Preprocessing procedures of BOLD included slice timing, realign-
ment, co-registration, normalization by T1 uniﬁed segmentation using a
modiﬁed MATLAB toolbox “Data Processing & Analysis of Brain
Imaging (version 3.0)” (Yan et al., 2016). After exclusion cases due to
head motion (translation or rotation head motion parameters larger
than 2 mm or 2°), 34 patients (15 in the training group and 19 in the
control group) were qualiﬁed for further analysis.
We calculated mean fractional amplitude of low frequency ﬂuc-
tuation (fALFF) from BOLD signals to represent individuals' regional
neural activities (Zou et al., 2008). Voxel based morphometry of gray
matter was also calculated as covariate volume.
2.3. Training
Cognitive training was carried out at patients' home online. Training
program is comprised of the following eight tasks.
Visual working memory task: In one session, patients were asked to
memorize several (2–8 cards, started from 2) playing cards (targets)
within some time (time (second) =2 × the number of targets). Then
they did a simple calculation, such as “4 + 6=” or “5–3=”. They
would be presented with another group of playing cards (probes) until
they calculated correctly. Then they needed to judge whether any card
(target) seen before was among the probes. The number of probes is
twice as many as targets. The diﬃculty level was self-adaptive. The
number of targets doubled (two successive correct responses), or re-
mained (one incorrect response) or decreased (two or more successive
incorrect responses) in the next session.
30-second memory task: It is similar to visual working memory task,
except for the calculation process. Patients enjoyed 30-second music
and scenery pictures instead of calculating. Self-adaptation was iden-
tical to visual working memory task.
Episodic memory task: Pictures (1–4 pictures) depicting an event
(e.g. Miss Wang is doing physical exercise in the morning in the park)
were presented for a few seconds. Then patients enjoyed 30-second
music and scenery pictures as an interruption. After music, patients
were asked questions about the event (e.g. What is Miss Wang doing in
the morning at the park: doing exercise? ﬁshing? sleeping?). Similarly,
the number of pictures doubled (two successive correct responses) or
remained (one incorrect response) or decreased (two or more successive
incorrect responses) in the next session.
Speed of calculation task: Flowers with arithmetic questions (e.g.
4 + 6 =? 5–3 =?, 6 × 5 =? 6÷3 =?) were moving downwards from
the top of the screen (one ﬂower with one question on it). Patients were
asked to answer these questions with keyboard as soon as possible. If
the answer was correct, the ﬂower (question) disappeared. If no correct
answer was given before the ﬂower moved to the bottom of screen, the
ﬂower stayed on the bottom. The task was over when the bottom line of
screen was fully occupied by the ﬂowers. The speed of ﬂowers gradually
increased during the task.
Visual search task: Patients performed a classic visual search task by
searching a letter “T” among “L”s. They were asked to choose “target
on” or “no target” as soon as possible (Horowitz and Wolfe, 1998).
Alertness task: In one trial, a red box was presented in the random
location as an alert for a while. After it disappeared, a golden coin was
presented in the identical location. The time between box dis-
appearance and presentation of the coin randomly varied. Patients were
asked to keep alert when box presented and press the “Enter” key as
quickly as they saw the coin.
Mental rotation task: Two “R”s (identical or mirrored “R”) of dif-
ferent angle were presented. Patients were asked to judge whether the
two letters were the same or mirrored as soon as possible.
Image re-arrangement task: The procedure of several daily activities
(e.g. shopping, washing) was separated into six steps depicted by six
pictures. All pictures were randomly sequenced. Patients were asked to
re-arrange the pictures into a reasonable sequence based on their
knowledge.
Patients in the training group were asked to perform all these tasks
3–4 times (about 120–160 min training in total) per week for 6 months.
Their login information and training performance on the web server
were checked weekly, and telephone interview was used to make sure
all participants in the training group got equally amounts of training.
2.4. Statistical analyses
We used per-protocol sets in order to strictly estimate the immediate
and late eﬀect of training. If patients were indicated cholinesterase
inhibitors or memantine, or they could not insist on training, their data
would be ruled out from analysis.
The diﬀerences of age, years of education, neuropsychological
score, gender, hypertension, and diabetes between two groups at
baseline were compared by the independent t-test or chi-square test.
We used mixed-eﬀect regression model with maximum likelihood
estimation to compare changes of cognitive scores between two groups.
The interaction eﬀect between time and group represented the training
eﬀect. In the training group, linear regression was used to estimate the
relationship between the training duration and the outcomes.
We deﬁned standardized change scores as changes between end-
point and baseline scores divided by standard deviation (SD) for all
patients combined. For comparison with other trials, we calculated
eﬀect size by subtracting mean standardized change scores in the
control group from those in the training group (Barnes et al., 2009).
Signiﬁcance of < 5% was used in all analyses, and SPSS 22 program
(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical data
analysis.
For the fMRI data analysis, a mixed model was also used to estimate
interaction between time and group. Standardized gray matter volumes
of the whole brain were used as covariates.
Regarding to multiple comparison correction, we used permutation
test (Winkler et al., 2016) with threshold-free cluster enhancement
(TFCE) to reach the best balance between family-wise error rate (under
5%) and test-retest reliability (Chen et al., 2018). In this way, the dis-
tribution of the maximum was used as reference, and the rank of a given
voxel in relation to that distribution was used to obtain p values. Sig-
niﬁcant voxels in the cerebral would be marked by BrainNet Viewer
(Xia et al., 2013).

3. Results
3.1. Clinical and cognitive results
A total of 141 MCI patients ﬁnished the 6-month follow-up. In the
training group, 78 patients completed the assessments at 6-month.
Among them, 3 patients (3.84%) converted to AD and 33 MCI patients
were continuously observed for another 12 months. In the control
group, 63 patients ﬁnished. Among them, 4 patients progressed to AD
(6.35%) and 30 MCI patients were followed up for another 12 months.
Dropout rate was higher in the control group (2.5% in the training
group and 21.25% in the control group). The main reason (10 patients
in 17) for dropout in the control group was that they contacted with
other physicians for medications.
The mean age of the population was 70.4 at baseline (SD 7.1), and
two groups were similar to each other (p = .1). Both groups were also
of similar level of education (p = .5), as well as hypertension and
diabetes. Global cognition assessed by MMSE was equivalent between
groups. Training group showed advantages in ﬂuency, language and
visuospatial ability assessed by ACER, recall in CFT and symbol digit
substitution test (p < .05, Table 1). In the training group, the averaged
training duration was 122.8 min every week, ranged from 100.0 to
158.6 min. The relationship between training duration and the eﬀect
size was found signiﬁcant in the following tests: MMSE, ACER, ACER
attention, ACER memory, CFT recall and AVLT 20-min recall (Fig. 2).
After six months follow-up, signiﬁcant beneﬁcial eﬀect of the
training was found for the primary outcome. The mean diﬀerence be-
tween groups in change of MMSE in the half year was 0.73 SD
(group×time interaction eﬀect, p = .002). MMSE improved 0.23 SD in
the training group compared to −0.5 SD in the control group (Fig. 3,
Table 2).
We also found signiﬁcant training eﬀects of ACER attention
(p = .002) and memory (p = .006), as well as SCWT interference index
(p = .038) and CFT copy (p = .035). Eﬀect size of verbal memory (5-
minute recall in AVLT) was marginally signiﬁcant in favor of the
training group (p = .080, range from 0.07 to 0.73 SD) (Table 2).
However, eﬀect size of ACER ﬂuency tended to favor the control group
(p = .073, ranged from −0.68 to −0.02 SD). Other diﬀerences of
changes in secondary outcomes between the groups were not statisti-
cally signiﬁcant.
Thirty-three patients in the training group and 30 patients in the
control group were observed for another 12 months. In this sub-popu-
lation, we ﬁrstly found similar improvement in the training group (33
patients)
at
6-month:
MMSE
(p < .001),
attention
in
ACER
(p < .001),
CFT
copy
(p = .05),
SDS
(p = .027),
SCWT-color
(p = .013) and STT-B (p = .020). However, in the following 12 months,
all diﬀerences between the changes in two groups were not statistically
signiﬁcant (Fig. 4).
3.2. fMRI results
The interaction eﬀect (group×time) in mixed model analysis was
depicted in the Fig. 5. It represented the diﬀerence between changes of
two groups at two time points (Diﬀerence = (training group at
6 months-training group at baseline)−(control group at 6 months-con-
trol group at baseline)). In fALFF results, clusters of positive diﬀerence
were detected at bilateral temporal poles, insular lobes and left para-
hippocampal gyrus (Fig. 5, corrected voxel level: p < .05). Clusters
found in bilateral temporal and insular lobes merged, with total size of
643 voxels. No signiﬁcantly negative diﬀerence was detected.
4. Discussion
In the trial, we estimated the eﬀectiveness of the Chinese-version
computer-based cognitive training in MCI patients. Regarding global
cognitive function, we observed an eﬀect size of 0.73 SD in MMSE and
0.31 SD in ACER in favor of the training group. MMSE decline in the
control group was about 1 point per 6-month. The Chinese-version
MMSE has been validated in China for > 20 years and its norm and
longitudinal changes in MCI patients are relatively more clear than
other cognitive tests. The only diﬀerence between the Chinses-version
MMSE and the original one is the phrase which should be repeated (“No
ifs, ands or buts”). It was replaced by a Chinese sentence. According to
MMSE studies in China, MMSE decreased by 0.6 to 2 per year in MCI
patients (Gao et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2006), which was consistent with
our data in the control group. Though eﬀect size of ACER was not
statistically signiﬁcant, it is similar in magnitude to other cognitive
training for normal aging (Lampit et al., 2014), MCI (Barnes et al.,
2009), and cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) for treatment of Alzhei-
mer's disease (Birks, 2006).
As for secondary outcomes, we observed eﬀect sizes for attention,
memory, visuospatial conﬁguration and executive function tests in
ACER consistently favored the training group. Attention test included
orientation (time and place), immediate memory, and successive cal-
culation. Memory test in ACER had a relatively short interval before
recall, which was similar to 5-minute recall in AVLT. It is suggested that
our training tended to beneﬁt short-term memory. In contrast, eﬀect
size of verbal ﬂuency test tended to favor the control condition. Since
the training program did not include verbal training, the result sug-
gested the hypothesis that training program may have domain-speciﬁc
eﬀects. The transfer eﬀect observed in other studies was conﬁned in
related abilities, such as visual working memory and spatial working
memory (Li et al., 2008), speed of processing and driving mobility (Ross
et al., 2016). No transfer eﬀect was observed between language and

other cognitive domains. Regarding to improvement of verbal ﬂuency
test of the control group, more studies are needed to determine whether
the eﬀect was due to random variation. In the subsample of patients
who tended to be followed up for another 12 months, similar eﬀects on
global cognition, attention, executive function, and visuo-spatial tests
were found immediately after the end of training. Nevertheless, after
one-year follow up without training, eﬀects were not signiﬁcant. The
results were partially consistent with other training studies. In a
memory training study, training eﬀect (working memory ability) and
transfer eﬀect were found improved immediately after training.
Nevertheless, after one-year follow up, both eﬀects were not signiﬁcant
(Buschkuehl et al., 2008). Spatial working memory task also has eﬀects
transferred to more demanding spatial tasks, with beneﬁts lasting only
for 3 months (Li et al., 2008).
In the resting-state fMRI, fractional ALFF (fALFF) approach, the
ratio of the power spectrum of low-frequency (0.01–0.08 Hz) to that of
the entire frequency range, is suggested better sensitivity and speciﬁcity
in detecting spontaneous brain activities (Zou et al., 2008). MCI pa-
tients showed decreased fALFF mainly in the medial prefrontal cortex,
posterior
cingulate
cortex/precuneus
and
hippocampus/para-
hippocampal gyrus, while there was increased activity in some tem-
poral regions (Wang et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2014; Han et al., 2011).

In a cognitive interventional study for healthy older adults, ALFF in
the middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and anterior cere-
bellum lobe was enhanced, corresponding to improved memory and
social support (Yin et al., 2014). Working memory training for young
adults increased fALFF in the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex,
frontopolar area and medial prefrontal cortex (Takeuchi et al., 2017).
These results suggested training-induced spontaneous brain activities
during the resting state. In our study, clusters in the bilateral temporal
lobes and insular cortices were enhanced measured by fALFF, as well as
clusters in the bilateral hippocampus.

We only observed positive interaction eﬀect, indicating positive
correlation between training and regional neural activity. The fMRI
results were partly consistent with neuropsychological outcomes im-
mediately after training. We observed that attention, short-term
memory, visuospatial conﬁguration, and executive function gained
from the training. Temporal poles were found as “semantic hub” of the
brain, and its neural codes were related with idiosyncratic patterns of
memory errors, as well as variation in true-memory performance
(Chadwick et al., 2016). Ventral regions of the temporal pole and para-
hippocampal gyri were also related to visual semantic representations
(Peelen and Caramazza, 2012). Besides, the integrity including bilateral
hippocampus and para-hippocampal gyri could enhance emotion in
memory processes (Kumfor et al., 2014).
The insular cortex has connections with the anterior cingulate
cortex, temporal pole, prefrontal cortex, frontal and parietal opercula,
visual association cortex, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex (Nagai
et al., 2007). Bilateral insular cortices and nearby angular gyri were
involved in various cognitive and mood processes, and its network with
hippocampus was related with attention (Loitfelder et al., 2012) and
visual cortex responses (Petro et al., 2017). Functional neuroimaging
studies have found insula hyper-activations for tasks including those
involving perception, intentional action, and consciousness (Gasquoine,
2014). It also demonstrated causal inﬂuences on all other frontal-cin-
gulate-parietal regions, serving as a major causal control hub during
multisensory attention (Chen et al., 2015). The neural activation in
insular cortex may help to explain the beneﬁt for visual and semantic
memory related tasks. Since insular cortex did not suﬀer injury in MCI
or early AD, it may also work as compensatory neural activities after
training.
Our study has limitation in the follow-up. MCI patients in the
training group may stop training if they suﬀer from more severe cog-
nitive decline, and patients in the control group will also drop out and
turn to other medical help when their symptoms get severe. The attri-
tion bias would obscure the interventional eﬀect if per-protocol sets
were strictly adopted. In further studies, an intention-to-treat analysis
would help minimize the bias. In addition, further studies should de-
termine the target population precisely and try to incorporate the
reason of dropout into ﬁnal eﬀect.
Beyond traditional cognitive stimulation, combined assessment and
training application by visual reality could be tried due to its more
convenience and high classiﬁcation rate for MCI patients (Zygouris
et al., 2017; D et al., 2015). In addition, multidomain intervention, as
well as physiological stimulation such as transcranial magnetic stimu-
lation, remains to be well investigated in clinical settings.
5. Conclusion
In summary, we designed the Chinese computer-based cognitive
training and found that it was eﬀective for delaying cognitive decline in
elders with MCI. The eﬀect was only observed immediately after
training and conﬁned to trained domains. Functional MRI suggested
corresponding increased local neural activities at bilateral temporal
poles, insular cortices and hippocampus.
