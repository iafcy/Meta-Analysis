T
he results of a pilot randomised controlled trial of computerised cognitive
training in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are reported.
Participants (N = 25) were randomised into either the treatment or waitlist train-
ing groups. Sixteen participants completed the 30-session computerised cognitive
training program using exercises that target a range of cognitive functions includ-
ing attention, processing speed, visual memory and executive functions. It was
hypothesised that participants would improve with practice on the trained tasks,
that the benefits of training would generalise to nontrained neuropsychological
measures, and that training would result in improved perceptions of memory and
memory functioning when compared with waitlist controls. Results indicated that
participants were able to improve their performance across a range of tasks with
training. There was some evidence of generalisation of training to a measure of
visual sustained attention. There were no significant effects of training on self-
reported everyday memory functioning or mood. The results are discussed along
with suggestions for future research.

BRAIN IMPAIRMENT 
VOLUME 12 NUMBER 3 DECEMBER pp. 187–199
Most cognitive training research in the elderly has
utilised either healthy samples or those with a
diagnosed dementia. A relatively neglected group
has been older people with mild cognitive impair-
ment (MCI). MCI is defined as cognitive decline
on objective tests relative to age-matched peers
but without functional impairment in activities of
daily living (Petersen et al., 1999) and is associ-
ated with an increased risk of dementia (Feldman
& Jacova, 2005). A distinction can be drawn
between two types of MCI, amnestic MCI with a
primary memory deficit, and nonamnestic MCI
where domains other than memory are affected.
Cognitive deficits reported in amnestic MCI
include deficits in episodic and semantic memory,
with difficulties encoding and storing information,
especially on nonverbal tasks. Apart from memory
difficulties, there can be deficits on tasks assessing
inhibition (Belleville, 2008), perceptual speed and
visuospatial abilities (Bennett et al., 2002).
These cognitive changes reflect pathological
changes in the brain. Neuroimaging studies reveal
both structural and functional changes in MCI
with progressive loss of both grey and white
matter, as well as reductions in cerebral metabolic
rate and cerebral blood flow. These changes begin
in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal regions
and later spread to the parietal, then temporopari-
etal and frontal lobes (Schuff & Zhu, 2007).
Until recently, treatment options have been
limited 
to 
either 
medications 
such 
as
cholinesterase inhibitors or compensation strate-

188

gies (e.g., the use of diaries, reminders, or associ-
ation). The teaching of memory strategies has
been aimed at compensating for functions that are
impaired by using external assistance and there is
an extensive literature on their application both in
healthy elderly and in early Alzheimer’s disease
(Clare & Woods, 2003; Papp, Walsh, & Snyder,
2006). These efforts to compensate (rather than
remediate) impairment have been the norm in
studies of older people with cognitive impairment
until quite recently. However, neither medications
nor compensatory strategies appear to be very
effective at either improving cognitive functioning
or at preventing dementia (Belleville et al., 2006;
Birks & Flicker, 2006; Petersen et al., 2005; Rapp,
Brenes, & Marsh, 2002).
An alternative approach draws on the concept
of neuroplasticity, the ability of the brain to change
in response to environmental stimulation through-
out the lifespan (Dinse, 2006). The processes
involved are not yet fully understood but are
thought to involve the growth of new brain cells,
the elaboration and strengthening of neural net-
works and the up-regulation of neurotransmitter
systems (Mahncke et al., 2006). It may be possible
to utilise these neuroplastic processes to train dis-
crete areas of cognition in the hope of maintaining
or improving cognitive functioning in MCI.
There are two lines of evidence to support the
utility of brain plasticity in this regard. The first is
data suggesting changes in brain structure and
functioning following cognitive training. In
animal studies, exposure to an enriched environ-
ment may result in both structural changes within
the brain and the prevention or delayed emergence
of neuropathology. For example, there are specific
changes in the brain such as neurogenesis, thick-
ened grey matter, elaboration of dendrites and
synapses when older rats are placed in stimulating
environments (Kempermann, Gast, & Gage,
2002). In transgenic mice, both the neuropathol-
ogy and the cognitive deficits associated with
Alzheimer’s disease are modulated by learning
and environmental enrichment (Billings, Green,
McGraugh, & LaFerla, 2007; Jankowsky et al.,
2005; Lazarov et al., 2005). In humans the evi-
dence is more limited. A study by Valenzuela et
al., (2003) found increased creatinine and choline
signals in the hippocampus after training healthy
elderly participants in memory strategies. Further,
there is some evidence that training on a working
memory task results in increased activation in the
frontal and parietal regions typically associated
with working memory tasks (Olesen, Westerberg
& Klinberg, 2004). The same training paradigm
may also increase the density of cortical dopamine
receptors in young adult participants (McNab et
al., 2009). However, changes noted in younger
adults following training, may not be found in
older adults (Nyberg et al., 2003).
The second line of evidence comes from treat-
ment studies using computerised exercises that are
designed to provide a progressive challenge to
participant’s cognitive abilities. In theory, these
exercises harness neuroplastic processes to pro-
duce changes in brain structure and function that,
over time, result in improved cognitive function-
ing (Mahncke et al., 2006). These exercises are
used to train a variety of cognitive domains, utilis-
ing tasks that may be either based on, or have sim-
ilarities to, established neuropsychological tests.
Computerised cognitive training has been shown
to improve the cognitive deficits associated with
schizophrenia, with reported medium effect sizes
across a range of cognitive domains (McGurk,
Twamley, Sitzer, McHugo & Mueser, 2006). An
adapted version of the on-line training software
used in this study has shown promise in improving
cognitive functioning in other populations such as
children with cancer-related brain injury (Kesler,
Lacayo & Jo, 2011), however, there is much less
research in older people with MCI. There are sev-
eral studies that use computerised cognitive train-
ing that report positive findings. For example,
Rozzini, Costardi, Vicini, Chilovi, & Franzoni
(2007) reported that MCI participants who were
also taking cholinesterase inhibitors showed
improved performance on measures of memory
and abstract reasoning after three month-long
blocks of training, interspersed with two months
of no training between each block, when partici-
pants were re-assessed three months after training
concluded. Talassi, Guerreschi, Feriani, & Fedi
(2007) found improved performance on visuospa-
tial ability and visual memory immediately fol-
lowing a three-week training computerised
training program. Cipriani, Bianchetti, &
Trabucchi (2006) noted improvements in
behavioural memory following two blocks of
training each lasting four weeks.
However, while these results are promising,
all these studies have methodological problems
such as nonrandom allocation to groups and inad-
equate control groups. A study by Barnes et al.,
(2009) that used an Randomised Controlled Trial
(RCT) design reported a trend toward significance
on measures of verbal learning and memory for
the treatment group but the results of the study
were difficult to interpret as the intended inert
control group also showed effects, albeit on differ-
ent measures. The study reported here seeks to
address some of those limitations by randomising

189
COMPUTERISED COGNITIVE TRAINING IN MCI
participants into either treatment or waitlist
groups and by using software designed to improve
a range of cognitive domains.
Mood and Cognition
The impact training may have on mood have also
been the subject of investigation. While it has
been suggested that training may adversely affect
mood by increasing participant’s awareness of
their cognitive deficits (Small et al., 1997), there is
no convincing evidence of either cognitive reha-
bilitation or training having any negative impact
on mood. Clare & Woods (2003) found no evi-
dence of any change in self-rated mood following
cognitive rehabilitation in their review of studies
carried out using participants with Alzheimer’s
disease, while in the treatment studies using MCI
participants cited above (Cipriani et al., 2006;
Rozzini et al., 2007; Talassi et al., 2006), the find-
ings suggested either improved mood or no
change following cognitive training.
Aims
This study was designed to examine the effects of
a computerised cognitive training program on
cognitive functions in a group of older adults diag-
nosed with MCI. The computer program was
broad based, with tasks designed to improve atten-
tion, processing speed, visual memory and cogni-
tive control. Consequently, it was hypothesised
that such training would lead to observable
changes on neuropsychological measures of sus-
tained attention, working memory, visual learning
and set shifting. Improvements following training
were also expected on secondary outcome mea-
sures such as perceptions of control of memory,
perceived performance of everyday memory tasks.
To gauge the impact of training on mood, a mea-
sure of mood was also included.
Method
The diagnosis of MCI was originally determined
by the consensus opinion of a Staff Specialist
Geriatrician, Psychogeriatrician and Clinical
Psychologist following a comprehensive Memory
Clinic evaluation including detailed neuropsycho-
logical testing, psychiatric assessment, physical
examination, blood pathology, Apolipoprotein
(APOE) genotype testing and cerebral imaging.
All participants were reevaluated on entry to the
study against standardised criteria (see later).
Participants who were on stable doses of
cholinesterase inhibitors for the duration of the
study were eligible to take part, but participants
who commenced taking these medications during
the study were excluded. Participants provided writ-
ten informed consent in accordance with HREA
requirements. Entry criteria were as follows.
Diagnosis of MCI — Amnestic (Single
domain) and/or Multiple domain. Participants
with nonmemory domain MCI were not eligible to
participate. MCI was determined using standard-
ised diagnostic criteria (Winblad et al., 2004) as
follows:
1.
Not normal, not demented (does not meet
DSM-IV, ICD-10 criteria for a dementia syn-
drome)
2.
Cognitive decline
(a) self and/or informant report and impair-
ment on objective tasks and/or
(b) evidence of decline over time on objective
cognitive tasks.
3.
Preserved basic activities of daily living / min-
imal impairment in complex instrumental
functions.
In addition, participants were required to have
intact global cognitive functioning (score > 23) on
the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE;
Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975); and absence
of untreated psychiatric illness or substance abuse
problems; and absence of visual, auditory or motor
impairment that would hinder use of a computer.
Sample
Twenty-seven community-dwelling older (age >
60 years) clients of the Department of Aged Care
and Rehabilitation Medicine Memory Clinic at
Royal North Shore Hospital, with a current diag-
nosis of MCI completed the baseline assessment.
Two participants were excluded at baseline due to
a MMSE score of < 24. Participants with both
MCI — Amnestic (n = 11) and MCI — Multiple
domain (n = 14) were randomised into the study.
Basic demographic data for the 25 participants
who were originally recruited into the study are
shown in Table 1. There were 16 females and 9
males who completed baseline testing.
Twelve participants were randomly assigned
to the treatment group and 13 to the waitlist group.
Randomisation was achieved by having an inde-
pendent person place slips of paper, with either
‘treatment’ or ‘waitlist’ written on them, into
opaque envelopes that were then sealed. At the
completion of baseline testing, participants were
then asked to select an envelope at random and
were assigned on the basis of the slip contained

190
MAURICE FINN AND SKYE MCDONALD
within. The treatment group commenced training
straightaway, and were re-assessed once training
was completed, whereas the latter waited approx-
imately six to eight weeks, and were then re-
assessed. Following this second assessment, the
waitlist group then commenced training and were
re-assessed at the completion of training. All post-
training assessments were carried out by trained
assessors who were blind to treatment group.
Due to attrition, 16 participants completed the
study, with 4 treatment and 5 waitlist group partic-
ipants either withdrawing or being excluded.
Noncompleters did not differ from those who
completed the study in terms of age, sex, educa-
tion, depressive symptoms or cognitive function
scores. The primary reasons for drop out included
unrelated medical or personal issues (7), or being
commenced on a cholinesterase inhibitor (2).
Participants took an average of 11.43 weeks to
complete the training exercises. The flow of par-
ticipants through the study to the posttest assess-
ment is shown in Figure 1.
Primary Outcome Measures
Selected tests from the Cambridge Automated
Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB,
2005) were used to provide measures of cognitive
functioning. The CANTAB is a reliable and well-
validated computerised neuropsychological test
battery, which automates data collection and scor-
ing. The tests included measures of the following
cognitive functions.
Visual Memory
Paired-associates learning (PAL — assesses visual
episodic memory). Normal performance on PAL
requires intact functioning of the medial temporal
lobe while Pattern recognition memory (PRM)
requires intact functioning of both the medial tem-
poral and frontal lobes (Owen, Sahakian, Semple,
Polkey, & Robbins, 1995). For PAL the outcome
measure used was the total number of errors
(adjusted). Errors are made when the participant
selects a box that does not contain the target stim-
ulus. The number of errors is adjusted to allow for
the number of stages attempted. For PRM, the
outcome measure used was percent correct on a
forced-choice recognition task.

COMPUTERISED COGNITIVE TRAINING IN MCI
Executive Functions
Intra-/extra-dimensional set shifting (IED —
assesses rule acquisition and attentional set shift-
ing). The extra-dimensional shift component of
IED has been shown to be sensitive to frontal lobe
lesions with a decrease in accuracy on this aspect
of the task. In contrast, patients with medial tem-
poral lobe lesions retain accuracy but exhibit
markedly slower performance compared with
normal controls (Owen, Sahakian, Semple,
Polkey, & Robbins, 1996). The outcome measure
used was total errors (adjusted), a measure of effi-
ciency in attempting the test. The number of errors
is automatically adjusted by the CANTAB scoring
program to allow for any stage not completed.
Spatial working memory (assesses working
memory and executive functions/ strategy use) is
primarily sensitive to damage to the frontal lobes
(Owen, Roberts, Polkey, Sahakian, & Robbins,
1991; Owen et al., 1995). The outcome measures
used were total errors, which is the number of
times a box is selected that is certain not to contain
the target; and strategy, which is the number of
times the participant begins a new search with the
same box (i.e., uses an efficient search strategy).
Attention
Rapid visual information processing (RVP) a mea-
sure of visual sustained attention. This test is sensi-
tive to damage in the parietal and frontal lobes
(Robbins, Elliot, & Sahakian, 1996). The outcome
measure used is RVP A’, a measure of sensitivity to
the target (range 0.00 to 1.00, bad to good), in this
case a measure of how quickly and accurately tar-
gets (three separate triple-digit sequences; e.g., 2–
4–8) are detected from among distractors. This
measure is sensitive to neurological damage associ-
ated with Alzheimer’s disease (Sahakian, Jones,
Levy, Gray, & Warburton, 1989).
Secondary Outcome Measures
Subjective memory impairment was assessed
using the Memory Functioning Questionnaire
(MFQ; Gilewski, Zelinski, & Schaie, 1990) a 64-
item questionnaire. Respondents rated all items on
a 7-point Likert scale. There are four subscales:
frequency of forgetting, change in functioning,
seriousness of problems, and use of mnemonics.
Higher scores indicate less memory problems.
Reliability of each the subscales is high (reported
alpha > 0.83). Concurrent validity studies indicate
that scores on the MFQ are related to performance
on psychometric measures of memory (Zelinski,
Gilewski, & Anthony-Bergstone, 1990).
Perceived control over memory was measured
using the Memory Controllability Inventory
(Lachman, Bandura, Weaver, & Elliott, 1995),
which consists of 12 items forming six subscales
(present ability, potential improvement, inevitable
decrement, effort utility, independence and
Alzheimer’s likelihood) and has acceptable relia-
bility (internal consistency of each subscale
reportedly ranges between alpha .58 to .77) and
validity (scores on the MCI subscales are associ-
ated with age, self-rated health, and performance
on memory tests). Respondents rated each item on
a 7-point Likert scale.
Mood was measured using the Depression
Anxiety and Stress Scale (Lovibond & Lovibond,
1995) 21-item version. This shortened version of
the DASS has been shown to have excellent relia-
bility (internal consistency for each subscale of at
least .87) and concurrent validity, being highly
correlated with well-established measures of
depression and anxiety such as the Beck
Depression Inventory and the Beck Anxiety
Inventory (Antony, Bieling, Cox, Enns, &
Swinson, 1998).
Computerised Cognitive Training Package
The training software was supplied by Lumosity
Inc. It consisted of 30 training sessions each con-
taining four or five cognitive exercises. There
were four broad cognitive domains targeted: nom-
inally attention, processing speed, visual memory
and cognitive control. All participants began at the
same level of difficulty. On each exercise, once a
predetermined criterion of performance was
reached, the level of difficulty was increased. The
six training exercises reported here are described
in detail.
Birdwatching
The silhouette of a bird appears briefly (initial
exposure time 400 ms) somewhere on the screen
while simultaneously a letter of the alphabet
appears for the same duration in a small box in the
centre of the screen. The participant has to firstly
click on the area where the bird appeared and, if
correct, is then asked to choose which letter
appeared from a choice of five alternatives. The
exercise commences at level one with a maximum
of ten possible levels. Once the participant reaches
a certain threshold level of performance, both the
duration of exposure and the location of the bird
stimulus are varied, with decreasing exposure time
and more distance between the bird stimulus and
the letter stimulus in the centre of the screen. These
parameters change systematically at each level.

192
MAURICE FINN AND SKYE MCDONALD
Colour Match
Two words appear adjacent to each other on the
screen, each of which is a colour. Participants
have to identify if the meaning of the word on the
left hand side matches the ink colour of the word
on the right hand side. The task is to give the cor-
rect answer as many times as possible in a 45-
second period.
Lost in Migration
A graphical depiction of a flock of five birds
appears. The participant has to press the arrow key
that corresponds to the direction of the bird in the
centre of the flock. The direction of the central
bird can be either the same of those of the other
birds or different. The task is to get as many cor-
rect as possible in a 45-second period.
Memory Match
Two symbols appear on the screen adjacent to
each other. The initial task is to identify whether
or not the two symbols match. Once this is done
the symbol on the far left is displaced by the
symbol from the right hand side, which is itself
replaced. As the task progresses, the symbol on
the left hand side gradually fades from view, forc-
ing the participant to rely on working memory.
The task is to complete as many correct in 45 sec-
onds.
Raindrops
Simple arithmetical equations appear inside
droplets that fall from the top of the screen
towards the bottom. The participant has to enter
the correct answer before the droplet reaches the
water at the bottom the screen. As the participant
solves more equations, the droplets fall towards
the bottom of the screen at increasing speed. The
task continues until three droplets reach the water
at the bottom of the screen.
Spatial Speed Match
A single symbol appears briefly in the centre of
the screen and is then replaced by another. The
task is to identify whether or not the new symbol
matches the previous one. The task is to get as
many correct as possible in a 45-second period.
The software provided feedback to partici-
pants as they completed each exercise and after
each session. The participants completed the
training at home using their own computers and
Internet access. All participants attended the clinic
and were provided with their own user identifica-
tion and password and shown how to access the
software. They were also given a demonstration of
how to use the software and observed completing
a training session. Participants were asked to com-
plete approximately four to five sessions of train-
ing per week. Adherence was monitored remotely
by visual inspection of the progress recorded on
the Lumosity web site. To promote training adher-
ence, all participants were followed up with
weekly telephone calls (and home visits as
required) during training. Participants who com-
pleted at least 80% of the sessions were eligible
for reassessment. The posttreatment assessments
were carried out by assessors who were blind to
treatment group.
Data Analysis
All analyses were carried out using PASW
Statistics -version 18. Planned analyses included
the following:
Pre/posttreatment effects for neuropsychologi-
cal tests (CANTAB), memory questionnaires
(MFQ, MCI) and mood (DASS) were examined
using 2 (group) × 2 (time) ANCOVA with MMSE
score as a covariate.
Trained Tasks
Data from all training sessions was consolidated
into four data points representing average perfor-
mance for 4 session blocks (e.g., sessions 1–4, 5–8,
9–12, 13–16). Learning effects were examined
using a repeated ANOVA. The training exercises
that were available for analysis were Birdwatching,
Colour Match, Lost in Migration, Memory Match,
Raindrops, and Spatial Speed Match.
Results
All data reported here are from the 16 participants
who completed training. Unless otherwise indi-
cated the data reported below are the comparisons
between the two groups at baseline and at posttest
(after the treatment group had completed training,
and before the waitlist group commenced train-
ing). At baseline, there were no significant differ-
ences between the two groups other than a trend
toward the treatment group being younger than the
waitlist group, see Table 2.
Preliminary Analyses
In order to determine whether treatment effects
were influenced by initial variability within and
between groups in demographic and cognitive fac-
tors, correlations were conducted between age,
years of education, MMSE scores, self-reported

193
COMPUTERISED COGNITIVE TRAINING IN MCI
memory functioning (MFQ subscales) and per-
ceptions of memory controllability (MCI sub-
scales) and posttraining outcome measures. On
this analysis, the only significant correlations
were between baseline MMSE score and all the
neuropsychological outcome measures (except
spatial working memory strategy score, Pearson’s
r range .553 to .706). Subsequently, all posttrain-
ing data were analysed using an ANCOVA with
MMSE score as a covariate. Results of the
ANCOVA for the primary and secondary outcome
measures are detailed in Table 3 showing overall
group differences, practice (time) effects and
treatment (group × time) effects. There were no
significant practice (time) effects for any of the
neuropsychological outcome measures.
Primary Outcome Measures: CANTAB
There was evidence of a treatment effect (group ×
time interaction) on a measure of visual sustained
attention (RVP A). No other treatment effects
were found on neuropsychological outcome mea-
sures. The interaction is shown in Figure 2.
Inspection of means (see Table 4) indicates
that the significant effect on visual sustained
attention was due to the combined effect of a gain
in the treatment group following training, and a
decline in the waitlist group scores on this task.
Secondary Outcome Measures: Self-
Reported Memory Functioning and Mood
There was no effect of training on self-reported
everyday memory functioning as measured by the
MFQ, or on perceptions of memory controllability
as measured by the MCI. There was no effect of
training on depression, anxiety or stress as mea-
sured by the DASS21.
Impact of training on waitlist group. After com-
pleting posttest, the waitlist group then com-
menced training and were re-assessed on
completion. There was no effect of training on the
waitlist group with all outcome measures non-
significant.
Performance on Trained Tasks
The data for the trained exercises for all partici-
pants (N = 16) are presented in Table 5. In order to
facilitate comparison across tasks, results are
shown as a proportion of the best obtained score,
with 1.00 representing the best score. As can be
seen, in each case a significant improvement

occurred on the trained tasks across learning trials,
although this varied across tasks. For example, on
the Birdwatching exercise participants achieved
only 35% of their best score initially and this
improved substantially with practice, whereas on
the Memory Match exercise they achieved 71.8%
of their best score initially, showing relatively less
improvement over time.
Relationship Between Trained Tasks and
Neuropsychological Measures at Baseline
Finally, in order to determine whether the training
exercises were, indeed, targeting the same
domains as measured by the primary outcome
measures, correlational analyses were carried out
to determine the relationship between each cogni-
tive training exercise in the first training session
and the CANTAB neuropsychological test scores
at baseline. The correlational matrix is presented
in Table 6 and the results did not suggest a singu-
lar relationship between individual domains.
Exercises deemed to train visual attention related
to visual working memory, but also to executive
functions and learning. The cognitive control task
(Colour Match) related to executive function but
also learning. Indeed, overall, data indicated that
all exercises were related primarily to measures of
visual working memory, and to a lesser extent
visual memory and executive functions. The pat-
tern of relationships suggests that each exercise
trains more than one cognitive domain.

COMPUTERISED COGNITIVE TRAINING IN MCI
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
effectiveness of a computerised cognitive training
program for older adults with MCI. Training was
broadly based, focusing on attention, processing
speed, visual memory and cognitive control. In
general, participants in the training program
demonstrated improved performance on the
trained tasks over time, although this varied
markedly across tasks. Using an RCT design, it
was found that the training program led to a sig-
nificant improvement on a measure of visual sus-
tained attention when compared with waitlist
control. No significant changes were noted on
other primary outcome measures. Nor was there
generalisation to self-reported memory function-
ing or perceptions of control over memory.
There are several possible reasons why gener-
alisation beyond that reported here was not seen in
this study, including factors such as the dose and
sequencing of training, variations in task difficulty
and the gap between the trained tasks and every-
day life. However, before considering those
issues, it could be argued that older adults with
memory loss are simply unable to generalise
trained skills of the kind utilised here. On this
view, any improvements on trained exercises
simply highlights a preserved learning capacity
that would be better utilised using a cognitive
rehabilitation approach applied to specific every-
day tasks. However, evidence from the ACTIVE
study (Ball et al., 2002; Willis et al., 2006) sug-
gests otherwise. While participants in that study
were nominally healthy elderly, Unverzagt et al.,
(2007) retrospectively identified a subset of par-
ticipants as memory impaired (those who had cog-
nitive test scores at baseline at least 1.5 SD below
that expected). While they reported that these par-
ticipants did not appear to benefit from training in
memory strategies, there was evidence of benefit
from other forms of training (e.g., reasoning train-
ing improved reasoning, processing speed training
improved processing speed), suggesting that
memory-impaired participants retain the capacity
to transfer trained skills, at least on nonmemory
domains.
Dose of Training
Another possible reason for the lack of generalisa-
tion across most outcome measures is that the
dose of training received was too low. The dose of
training is potentially an important issue as neuro-
plastic changes following cognitive stimulation
require a range of processes that occur over differ-
ent timeframes. Thus, a low dose of training may
stimulate only relatively transient processes such
as upregulation of neurotransmitters rather than
medium and longer term changes such as neuro-
genesis, synaptogenesis and the formation of new
neural networks (Valenzuela, Breakspear &
Sachdev, 2007). In the literature there is currently
no consensus as to what dose of training is required
in order to see effects and the amount of training
varies widely. Relatively brief cognitive training
(600 minutes), a similar dose to that used in this
study, has been shown to have transfer effects on a
healthy elderly sample in the large scale ACTIVE
study (Ball et al., 2002; Willis et al., 2006), whereas
other studies have used a significantly larger dose.
For example, the training program used by Barnes
et al., (2009) consisted of relatively long sessions
(100 minutes/day, 5 days/week) delivered in a
shorter duration (6 weeks) a total dose of approxi-
mately 3000 minutes.
It is possible there was a dose–response effect
in our study. As all the training exercises used here
require visual attention skills, participants may
have received a larger dose of visual attention
training (the only measure to show change follow-

ing training) when compared with other domains
such as visual memory, processing speed, or
divided attention. By implication, it is possible
that the dose of training received on those other
domains was simply too low to show effects in
this population.
Task Complexity
The training exercises used in this study appeared
to target several different cognitive domains as
can be seen by the correlations with baseline
CANTAB scores. This may have had unintended
consequences as participants were faced with
exercises that called upon a range of impaired
skills simultaneously. For example, the training
exercise that showed the least improvement with
training (Memory Match) relies on intact process-
ing speed, working memory and visual memory,
domains that were often attenuated or impaired in
this sample. Salthouse (1996) suggests that tasks
requiring effective encoding and retrieval rely on
intact working memory and processing speed, so
problems with these domains may have had detri-
mental effects on learning and recall exercises.
Sequencing of Training
The problems with task complexity suggest that
MCI participants may require training in non-
memory domains prior to tackling complex
memory exercises. In our study, memory tasks
were given in the same session with executive
tasks. This may have made participants more
aware of the contrast in difficulty between exer-
cises, leading to problems such as loss of motiva-
tion on those exercises or directing greater effort
at exercises they found easier to master. This sug-
gests that training may be better delivered in two
phases, an initial phase where training focuses on
executive skills (e.g., attention, processing speed,
working memory) and a second phase where
memory tasks are introduced. Training executive
skills potentially has a range of benefits as these
skills are useful for everyday tasks such as driving
and planning. Intact executive skills may also aid
individuals in compensating for memory loss.
Dissimilarity Between Training Exercises
and Everyday Activities
Another possible explanation for the lack of gen-
eralisation across tasks or in everyday life may be
the dissimilarity between training exercises and
everyday activity. Computer training may be more
likely to generalise if it focuses upon tasks that
closely resemble daily life rather than the game-
like environment of the cognitive training program
used here. For example, Foreman, Stanton-Fraser,
Wilson, Duffy, and Parnell (2005) asked a small
sample of healthy elderly participants to explore a
virtual shopping mall, and reported that this exer-
cise led to greater accuracy in how well they could
point out the direction in which certain locations

COMPUTERISED COGNITIVE TRAINING IN MCI
lay, perform tasks, navigate and make maps when
taken to the same shopping mall in real life. This
suggests that practising everyday memory tasks in
a virtual environment may enhance transfer of
training to real life.
Limitations and Future Directions
Some limitations of the study should be acknowl-
edged. Firstly, the study was small and underpow-
ered, which limited the ability to see real effects.
The extent to whether improvement in visual
attention was related to improvement in the treat-
ment group rather than a decline in the waitlist
group also requires replication. Given the small
number of participants and the number of analyses
conducted, the possibility of a Type I error cannot
be entirely excluded. Secondly, while the reported
improvement with practice on the trained tasks
indicated that computerised cognitive training
promotes learning, this promising finding awaits
comparison using a normal elderly control group.
This would enable us to quantify a normal level of
performance on the training exercises against
which the performance of our MCI sample could
be compared. For example, in a study reported by
Belleville et al. (2006), MCI participants were able
to improve their level of performance to that com-
mensurate with untrained normal elderly following
training on memory strategies. Thirdly, participants
completed the training at home, using their own
computers. A more structured and standardised
clinical environment may have enhanced the train-
ing experience. Adherence to the treatment sched-
ule was variable, with most participants taking
longer than anticipated to complete training (an
average of 11.43 weeks vs. an anticipated 6–10
weeks) which may have diluted any effects.
Conclusion
This research demonstrates that a sample of older
adults with MCI can improve their performance
significantly when given repeated practice on
computerised cognitive exercises. It also high-
lights some of the practical problems in delivering
this form of cognitive training. It suggests that
future research should examine more critically
issues to do with the dose and sequencing of train-
ing to turn this nascent area of research into a
valuable addition to clinical practice.
