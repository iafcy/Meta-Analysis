ABSTRACT
The purpose of the present study was to explore the effects of computer-based multidomain cog-
nitive training program on Greek patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Forty-six patients
with MCI were randomly divided into two groups; (a) the training group, which received a com-
puter-based multidomain cognitive training program with the use of the RehaCom software and
(b) the control group, which underwent standard-clinical care. The duration of the computer-based
training program was 15 weeks, administered twice a week for approximately one hour per ses-
sion. Analysis of the baseline versus endpoint performance of each group demonstrated that in
the control group delayed memory and executive function had deteriorated over the observation
period of 15 weeks, while improvement was observed in the training group’s performance on
delayed memory, word recognition, Boston Naming Test (BNT), Clock Drawing Test (CDT),
Semantic Fluency (SF), Trail Making Test-A (TMT-A) and Trail Making Test-B (TMT-B). Comparison
between the two groups presented asignificant effect of the intervention for most cognitive
domains. These findings are promising for the development of training methods designed to
delay cognitive decline in patients with MCI, which is considered to be the prodromal stage of
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).

Introduction
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) often appears in the pre-
cursor period between normal ageing and dementia and is
thus
considered
as
the
first
step
towards
dementia
(Dardiotis et al., 2019; Greenaway, Duncan, & Smith, 2013;
Jelcic et al., 2012; Manouilidou, Dolenc, Marvin, & Pirtosek,
2016; Stamati et al., 2019). Epidemiological studies have
shown that 8–15% of individuals with MCI will progress to
dementia every year, and up to 80% will progress to demen-
tia within six years. A group of MCI patients with memory
impairment is the typical prodromal stage of dementia and
carries a high conversion risk to Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
(Petersen et al., 2013). Indeed, the majority of patients with
MCI develop AD, although some do stay stable and a few of
them even get better (Schaefer, Dibble, & Duff, 2015).
Prior research has revealed that patients with MCI face
problems with memory (Ganguli, Dodge, Shen, & DeKosky,
2004; Olchik, Farina, Steibel, Teixeira, & Yassuda, 2013;
Savulich et al., 2017; Tsapanou et al., 2017), attention
(Herrera, Chambon, Michel, Paban, & Alescio-Lautier, 2012)
executive function (Barekatain, Alavirad, Tavakoli, Emsaki,
& Maracy, 2016; Huckans et al., 2013), verbal fluency (Taler,
Klepousniotou, & Phillips, 2009) and lexical decision tasks
(Taler & Jarema, 2004). Moreover, they have been found to
present less sensitivity to semantic violations when com-
pared to healthy controls (semantic priming) (Davie et al.,
2004) and to face difficulties categorizing the words based
on their meaning (Olchik et al., 2013) or rhyme (Dwolatzky
et al., 2003).
To date, no approved pharmacological treatment for cog-
nitive decline in MCI has been made available (Vlachos
et al., 2019). Consequently, research has focused on finding
effective, non-pharmacological interventions (Cooper, Li,
Lyketsos, & Livingston, 2013). Computer-based cognitive
training seems to be beneficial for individuals with MCI
since it can slow down their cognitive decline, or even, in
some cases, optimize their cognitive functioning (Mueller,
2016; Tsolaki et al., 2017). Several studies using computer-
based cognitive training interventions have reported that, at
the end of the intervention, the training group performed
better on working memory (Oskoei, Nejati, & Fathabadi,
2013), delayed memory (Herrera et al., 2012; Olchik et al.,
2013), executive function (Greenaway et al., 2013; Herrera
et al., 2012), episodic recall and recognition (Herrera et al.,

2012), semantic fluency (Olchik et al., 2013; Rojas et al.,
2013; Rozzini et al., 2007; Talassi et al., 2007) and naming
(Rojas et al., 2013) when compared to passive or control
groups with MCI.
Some computer-based cognitive training programs have
mainly focused on specific areas, such as memory and attention
(Han et al., 2014; Herrera et al., 2012; Hyer et al., 2016; Man,
Chung, & Lee, 2012; Mansbach, Mace, & Clark, 2017; Savulich
et al., 2017; Styliadis, Kartsidis, Paraskevopoulos, Ioannides, &
Bamidis, 2015), since these domains are considered to be the
first to be affected in the progression of the impairment. On the
other hand, other studies have pointed out the advantages of a
multidomain computer-based cognitive training, instead of a
domain-focused approach (Bahar-Fuchs et al., 2017; Barban
et al., 2016; Delbroek, Vermeylen, &
Spildooren, 2017;
Fiatarone Singh et al., 2014; Gooding et al., 2016). Ge, Zhu, Wu,
and McConnell (2018), in their recent review, observed that in
studies in which interventions were focused on a specific cogni-
tive domain, patients’ performance improved in this specific
domain (e.g., memory or attention) only, whereas in studies
where multiple cognitive domain intervention programs were
used, participants’ performance improved in most of the cogni-
tive domains (Bahar-Fuchs et al., 2017; Delbroek et al., 2017;
Ge et al., 2018; Gooding et al., 2016). This general improvement
of their cognitive ability is reported to have positively affected
their daily life as well and mood (Bahar-Fuchs, Clare, & Woods,
2013; Gooding et al., 2016; Savulich et al., 2017).
In the present study, forty-six Greek patients with MCI
were carefully chosen based on the criteria proposed by
Petersen et al. (2013). Almost half of them (25 patients)
received a 15-week, computer-based multidomain cognitive
training with the use of the RehaCom software. RehaCom
trains several cognitive domains, such as memory, attention,
logical thinking, visuo-motor disturbances, executive func-
tion and processing speed.
Although many studies have reported the benefits of
RehaCom in Parkinson’s disease (Diez-Cirarda et al., 2017;
Pena et al., 2014), mild AD (Nousia et al., 2018), multiple
sclerosis (Dardiotis et al., 2017; Nasios, Messinis, Kosmidis,
& Papathanasopoulos, 2018; Rilo et al., 2018), brain injuries
(Fernandez et al., 2012; Pantzartzidou et al., 2017) and
schizophrenia (d’Amato et al., 2011; Guerrero Pertinez &
Garcia Linares, 2015; Mak et al., 2013), its effect on MCI
has not been explored before. Moreover, RehaCom is a rela-
tively new intervention program for Greek researchers and
clinicians
(Dardiotis
et
al.,
2017;
Messinis,
Papathanasopoulos, Kosmidis, Nasios, & Kambanaros, 2018;
Nasios et al., 2018; Nousia et al., 2018; Pantzartzidou et al.,
2017; Yoo, Yong, Chung, & Yang, 2015). In particular,
Nousia et al. (2018), who explored the effect of RehaCom in
mild AD, a disease more closely related to MCI compared
to the other studies, reported its significantly beneficial effect
on attention, processing speed, naming, semantic fluency,
delayed memory, visuospatial ability and executive function.
As expected, the general cognitive improvement was con-
nected to patients’ higher quality of life.
Therefore, based on the outcomes of the aforementioned
studies, in which RehaCom was used, the training group of
the present study is predicted to demonstrate: (a) an
improvement
on
its
performance
in
several
cognitive
domains, compared to its performance before the interven-
tion and (b) better performance in most of the trained
domains compared to the controls.
Method
Participants
In the time period from January to June 2018, a total of 87
patients with MCI, native speakers of the Greek language,
attending the Clinical Laboratory of Speech and Language
Therapy of the University of Ioannina, were screened for
suitability of participation in the study. Forty-one patients,
however, were excluded for specific reasons (Figure 1) and
consequently, 46 MCI patients were enrolled in the study,
none of whom dropped out during the training period.
These patients were randomly divided into two groups; (a)
the training group which underwent multidomain cognitive
training intervention with the RehaCom software (Training
Group, TG; 6 males, 19 females), and (b) the control group
(CG; 5 males, 16 females), whose members received the
standard clinical care, namely they continued taking their
prescribed medication and receiving the needed treatment
(e.g., physiotherapy, psychotherapy etc). This group of
patients, for ethical reasons, was offered the opportunity to
undertake
cognitive
training
after
completion
of
the
study period.
The diagnosis of MCI was made in accordance with
Petersen’s criteria (Petersen et al., 2013). According to
Petersen et al. (2013), the diagnostic criteria of MCI are: (1)
memory complaints, (2) intact activities of daily living
(using

Theotoka, et al., 2007), (3) a score of 1.5 SD below the
mean on neuropsychological measures (which is considered
to be the standard cutoff point between healthy subjects and
subjects with cognitive deficits), (4) no dementia, (5) impair-
ment in at least one cognitive domain (e.g., complex atten-
tion, executive function, learning, memory). All patients
fulfilled all five criteria. Other patients’ inclusion criteria
were: (1) general cognitive function (MoCa score from 20 to
25) (Jak et al., 2016; Konstantopoulos, Vogazianos, &
Doskas, 2016), (2) age between 60–80 years and (3) at least
6 years of education, (4) the severity of functional impair-
ment with Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR; Golomb,
Kluger, & Ferris, 2004) to be 0.5 ¼ mild cognitive impair-
ment. The researcher submits the scores to a computer pro-
gram which presents each participant’s dementia rating.
On the other hand, exclusion criteria were: (1) presence
of an additional neurological (e.g., stroke, epilepsy, and trau-
matic brain injury) or psychiatric disorder (e.g., psychotic
symptoms or disorders, alcohol or illegal drug abuse), (2)
presence of depression, which was evaluated with Geriatric
Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15; Yesavage & Sheikh, 1986; for
Greek Foutoulakis et al., 1999); a score below 5 points on
the GDS-15 is suggestive of depression, (3) visual/hearing
impairment or writing/reading disability sufficient to impair

the performance in the assessment and the training. All par-
ticipants had undergone a clinical neurological assessment
with neurological examination, laboratory tests and brain
magnetic resonance imaging scans, which presented no evi-
dence of other neurological or psychiatric diseases.
The evaluation of the participants was performed separ-
ately by both a neurologist and an experienced neuropsych-
ologist pre and post the intervention program. Both the
neurologist and the neuropsychologist were blind to the
allocation of participants to groups (training and control).
All the collected data was reviewed, and diagnoses were
assigned using published criteria, after expert consensus
meetings, including the neurologists (who examined the par-
ticipants) and the neuropsychologists (who performed the
neuropsychological batteries). To sum up, the diagnosis of
MCI was based on Petersen criteria, additional inclusion cri-
teria and neurological and neuropsychological assessment.
All subtypes of MCI patients were included in the study,
namely with deficits in a single or multiple domains with
and without memory problems. Due to the relatively small
sample size, however, it was not able to assess the effects of
the intervention on the subgroups separately.
Participants’
neuropsychological
assessment
was
per-
formed via the use of the following measures:
1.
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Smith, Gildeh,
& Jolmes, 2007; for Greek Konstantopoulos et al., 2016):
A brief 30-question test. Scores range from 0 to 30,
with a score of 26 and higher generally considered nor-
mal. The cognitive areas and scoring breakdown is as
follows: visuospatial and executive functioning: 5 points,
animal naming: 3 points, attention: 6 points, language:
3 points, abstraction: 2 points, delayed recall (Short-
term Memory): 5 points, orientation: 6 points. One
point is added to participants’ score if (s)he has 12 years
or less of formal education.
2.
Clock Drawing Test (CDT; (Nair et al., 2010): The clin-
ician gives the person being tested a piece of paper with
a pre-drawn circle on it and asks him/her to draw the
numbers on the clock. Then the patients have to draw
the clock hands indicating 10 min past 11. The 15-point
range was divided into four subgroups: clock outline
(2 points), numerals (6 points), time setting (6 points),
and center (1 point).
3.
Recall, recognition and delay memory were evaluated
with the use of immediate word recall, word recognition
and
delayed
word
memory
test
(Kokkinins,
2019;
Kosmidou, Bozikas, & Vlaxou, 2012): A list of 10 words
is given to the patients and they have to repeat as many
as they can in every try (4 tries). Then, a new list with
twenty words is given verbally (10 words from the pre-
vious list and 10 new words). This time patients have to
recognize which word is new and which is not. In the
last task (delay memory), after 30 min, patients have to
recall as many words as they can from the first list
(10 words)

and rarely seen objects, each one in around 20 s. Every
correct answer is awarded with one point, thus the
maximum score is 15.
5.
Semantic Fluency measure (SF; Tombaugh, Kozak, &
Rees, 1999; for Greek Kosmidou, Vlahou, Panagiotaki,
& Kiosseoglou, 2004): The participants are given 30 s to
generate as many distinct words as possible for each of
three categories: fruit, vegetables and objects. The scores
for all the categories are summed.
6.
Attention and working memory were explored with the
use of the digit span forward (DSF) and digit span back-
ward (DSB) test (Richardson, 2007): It involves the oral
presentation of spans of digits. The measure has both a
7-item digits forward task and a 7-item digits backward
task, each one with its own individual score. As the two
paradigms measure distinct function, the disparate scores
allow for richer interpretation than that provided by
similar assessment instruments on the market.
7.
Visual attention, executive function and processing
speed were evaluated with the use of the Trail-making
Test, part A, part B (TMT-A & TMT-B; Tombaugh,
Rees,
&
McIntyre,
1998;
for
Greek
Vlachou
&
Kosmidou, 2012): Both parts of the Trail Making Test
consist of 25 circles distributed over a sheet of paper. In
Part A, the circles are numbered from 1 to 25, and the
patient should draw lines to connect the numbers in
ascending order. In Part B, the circles include both
numbers (1–13) and letters (A–L) and the patient has
not only to draw lines to connect the circles in an
ascending pattern, but also conduct the added task of
alternating between the numbers and letters (i.e., 1-A-2-
B-3-C, etc.). The patient, in both tasks, is instructed to
connect the circles as quickly as possible, without lifting
the pen or pencil from the paper. It is unnecessary to
continue the test if the patient has not completed both
parts after 5 min have elapse.
The
cognitive
status
of
the
participants
(attention-
processing speed, executive function, immediate and delayed
word, recall and recognition, naming, semantic fluency) was
measured before (at baseline) and one week after the com-
pletion of the computer- based multidomain cognitive train-
ing (endpoint).
Procedure
RehaCom
The TG received in total 30 60-min individual sessions over
a period of 15 weeks (i.e., two sessions per week). The multi-
domain cognitive training intervention program was based
on the use of the elderly-friendly software package named
RehaCom Cognitive Therapy Software which has been uti-
lized extensively in Europe over the last couple of years for
the
purpose
of
providing
computer-assisted
cognitive
rehabilitation. Moreover, the software which has over 20
modules is available in many languages, including Greek.
The RehaCom consists of a specially-designed input panel
and a large screen that helps patients be trained in several
cognitive domains, such as episodic and delayed memory,
verbal memory, attention, processing speed and executive
function. All participants began training at the beginner’s
level of the RehaCom software. The training modules auto-
matically adapted the training tasks to the user’s level of
performance, providing the opportunity to train patients on
several levels of difficulty and length of sessions and, accord-
ing to whether the patient succeeded or failed the task, the
difficulty levels were automatically adjusted to meet the
patient’s ability. All patients were trained on the same tasks
for
equal
duration
(min/task)
in
every
session.
Neuropsychological assessment included tests of attention,
processing speed, verbal fluency, working, delay and visuo-
spatial memory, recall, recognition, naming and executive
function. The cognitive training with the use of RehaCom
software was also based on those evaluated sectors.
The
research
protocol
was
approved
by
the
Ethics
Committee of the Medical School of Larissa, University of
Thessaly, and it was conducted in accordance with the princi-
ples of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written consent was
obtained from all the participants after having been informed
of the nature of the study they would take part in. Moreover,
the participants were informed of the option of terminating
the experiment at any time they wished without there being a
requirement to provide any justification for their decision.
Statistical analysis
In order for the differences in baseline characteristics
between the two groups to be examined, Independent
Sample T-tests were performed. A series of 2  2 mixed
ANOVAs, with Group as the between-subjects independent
variable and Time as the within-subjects independent vari-
able, was conducted to explore their interaction effects on
the dependent variables (Recall, Delayed memory, Word rec-
ognition, BNT, SF, CDT, DSF, DSB, TMT-A, TMT-B).
Further within group comparisons, using Paired Samples
T-tests, were obtained, in order for the performance of each
group before and after the intervention to be explored.
The effect of the intervention was estimated by comparing
the mean difference of the two assessments (baseline minus
endpoint in each group) between the groups (training group
vs. controls), with the use of Independent-Samples T-test.
Cohen’s d and the effect size of the intervention were calcu-
lated
according
to
the
site
https://www.uccs.edu/lbecker/.
Correction for multiple testing comparison was assessed we
used the false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini & Hochberg,
1995). The level of significance was set at 0.05 for all the anal-
yses. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS
(version 21) statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
Results
No statistically significant differences were found in baseline
characteristics between the two groups, apart from their per-
formance in the Semantic Fluency task, in which the CG
achieved higher scores compared to the TG [t(44) ¼ 3.363,
p ¼ 0.002]. Table 1 presents the demographic and clinical

characteristics of both groups, whereas the baseline scores in
neuropsychological measures of the training and the control
group are shown in Table 2.
The statistics revealed statistical significant main effect of
Time [F(1,44) ¼ 4.212, p ¼ 0.046], for the measure Recall, but
no significant interaction of Group and Time [F(1,44) ¼
0.750, pcorrected ¼ 0.488]. Although, both groups’ endpoint
performance was improved compared to their baseline per-
formance, this improvement was not statistically significant
[TG: t(24) ¼ 2.078, pcorrected ¼ 0.081; CG: t(20) ¼ 0.846, pcor-
rected ¼ 0.488]. As for the Delayed memory, no main effect
of Time was found [F(1,44) ¼ 1.394, p ¼ 0.244], but an inter-
action of Group and Time [F(1,44) ¼ 24.433, pcorrected
0.001] appeared. Further analysis, using Paired Samples
T-tests, revealed that TG’s performance was statistical sig-
nificantly improved [t(24) ¼ 4.272, pcorrecte ¼ 0.005], whereas
CG’s performance was statistical significantly decreased
between the two assessment times [t(20) ¼ 2.769, pcorrected ¼
0.024]. On the Word recognition measure, the ANOVA
demonstrated a statistical significant main effect of Time
[F(1,44) ¼ 9.065, p ¼ 0.004], but no significant interaction of
Group and Time [F(1,44) ¼ 2.293, pcorrected ¼ 0.216]. The
TG’ performance was statistical significantly improved after
the intervention, while CG’ performance remained almost
the same between the two assessment times [TG: t(24) ¼
2.823, pcorrected ¼ 0.019; CG: t(20) ¼ 1.420, pcorrected ¼
0.244]. As for BNT, there was no main effect of Time
[F(1,44) ¼ 3.015, p ¼ 0.089], but an interaction between
Group and Time was found [F(1,44) ¼ 6.326, pcorrected ¼
0.030].
TG’s
performance
was
statistical
significantly
improved [t(24) ¼ 5.316, pcorrected 0.001] after the interven-
tion whereas CG’s performance was only slightly decreased
[t(20) ¼ .396, pcorrected ¼ 0.720]. For the measure of SF, the
statistics revealed a statistical significant main effect of Time
[F(1,44) ¼ 22.855, p  0.001] and significant interaction of
Group and Time [F(1,44) ¼ 82.138, pcorrected 0.001]. TG’s
performance was statistical significantly improved [t(24) ¼
9.424, pcorrected 0.001], whereas CG’s performance was stat-
istical significantly decreased between the two assessment
times [t(20) ¼ 3.284, pcorrected ¼ 0.010]. The 2  2 ANOVA
showed a statistical significant main effect of Time [F(1,44) ¼
4.406, p ¼ 0.042] and significant interaction of Group and
Time [F(1,44) ¼ 7.292, pcorrected ¼ 0.017] for the CDT meas-
ure. Further analyses revealed statistical significant improve-
ment only for the TG, whereas CG’ performance remained
stable [TG: t(24) ¼ 2.854, pcorrected ¼ 0.019; CG: t(20) ¼ .698,
pcorrected ¼ 0.560]. For the DSF measure, no main effect of
Time [F(1,44) ¼ 0.151, p ¼ 0.700] and no interaction of
Group and Time [F(1,44) ¼ 1.386, pcorrected ¼ 0.319] was
found. Although no further analysis was needed, Paired
Samples T-tests were conducted for reasons of analogy [TG:
t(24) ¼ 0.499, pcorrected ¼ 0.666; CG: t(20) ¼ 1.420, pcorrected
¼ 0.244]. As for DSB, no main effect of Time [F(1,44) ¼
1.490, p ¼ 0.229], but an interaction of Group and Time
[F(1,44) ¼ 5.265, pcorrected ¼ 0.045] was found. In the TG,
participants’ improvement did not reach significance [t(24) ¼
0.679, pcorrected ¼ 0.560], whereas CG’s performance during
the second assessment was significantly decreased compared
to its performance during the first assessment [t(20) ¼ 3.202,
pcorrected ¼ 0.010]. In the last two measures (TMT-A and
TMT-B) the fastest performance is also the best one. The

significant interaction of Group and Time [TMT-A: F(1,44)
¼ 24.452, pcorrected <0.001; TMT-B: F(1,44) ¼ 9.646, pcorrected
¼ 0.010]. Further analyses demonstrated that the TG per-
formed significantly faster after the intervention in both
TMT-A [t(24) ¼ 5.487, pcorrected <0.001] and TMT-B [t(24) ¼
4.300, pcorrected <0.001], whereas no statistical difference was
found between the two assessment times in the CG on
either TMT-A [t(20) ¼ 1.316, pcorrected ¼ 0.276] or TMT-B
[t(20) ¼ 0.052, pcorrected ¼ 0.959].
Table 3 presents the mean scores (and standard devia-
tions) for each measure and each group in both assessment
times, as well as the difference between the two assessments
(p-values). As we can see, the TG improved its performance
in all the tested cognitive domains. In particular, the TG
patients’ improvement, after the intervention, reached sig-
nificance in, Delayed memory, Word recognition, BNT, SF,
CDT, TMT-A and TMT-B. In DSF and DSB, however, TG
patients’ improvement did not manage to reach significance.
On the contrary, the controls remained stable in most of the
neuropsychological measures over the observation period of
15 weeks. In three cognitive measures, however, their end-
point performance was statistically significantly lower, com-
pared to that of their initial performance (DSB, Delayed
memory, SF).
Comparison between the two groups (TG vs. CG) in the
mean difference of the two neuropsychological assessments
(baseline minus endpoint in each group) presented a signifi-
cant effect of the intervention; the TG’s improved perform-
ance was statistically significantly better on Delayed memory
[t(44) ¼ 4.943, pcorrected <0.001], BNT [t(44) ¼ 2.515, pcorrected
¼ 0.030], SF [t(44) ¼ 9.063, pcorrected <0.001], CDT [t(44) ¼
2.700, pcorrected ¼ 0.017], DSB [t(44) ¼ 2.295, pcorrected ¼
0.045], TMT-A [t(44) ¼ 4.945, pcorrected <0.001] and TMT-B
[t(44) ¼ 3.106, pcorrected ¼ 0.010] when compared to CG’s per-
formance. No significant difference, however, was noted
between
the
two
groups’
mean
difference
of
the
two
neuropsychological assessments on the Recall [t(44) ¼ 0.866,

rected ¼ 0.216] and the DSF [t(44) ¼ 1.177, pcorrected ¼ 0.319]
(see also Table 4). The absolute value of effect size correlation
of the training ranged from 0.42 for TMT-B to 0.80 for SF.
Discussion
Since in the AD continuum, the prodromal state of MCI
precedes AD (Dardiotis et al., 2019; Oltra-Cucarella et al.,
2018; Slot et al., 2019; Varatharajah, Ramanan, Iyer, &
Vemuri, 2019), being able to map and improve patients’

impairments in this early stage, is of significant importance,
as it might lead to an effective way to dramatically delay or
even prevent the appearance of AD.
Having this in mind, and based on systematic reviews on
cognitive
training,
which
have
demonstrated
promising
effects on subjects with MCI (Belleville, 2008; Cooper et al.,
2013; Gates, Sachdev, Fiatarone Singh, & Valenzuela, 2011;
Ge et al., 2018; Jean, Bergeron, Thivierge, & Simard, 2010),
especially
when
multidomain
computer-based
cognitive
trainings were used (Ge et al., 2018), we wanted to examine
the effects of the RehaCom software on Greek patients with
MCI and add to the existing evidence.
The RehaCom software has already been used on Greek
patients with mild AD (Nousia et al., 2018), multiple scler-
osis (Dardiotis et al., 2017; Messinis et al., 2018; Nasios
et al., 2018) and brain injuries (Pantzartzidou et al., 2017)
with positive results, but never before has it been used in
examining whether such an intervention can also positively
affect people with mild cognitive problems.
The present study provides evidence that individualized,
computer-based multidomain cognitive training in patients
with MCI being applied twice a week, for 60 min per session
improves all cognitive functions. In particular, our results
demonstrated that the RehaCom software had a significant
impact on delayed memory, word recognition, naming,
semantic fluency, attention, processing speed and executive
function. It is worth noting that, even though executive
functions scores were slow before and after the training, the
training group improved significantly compared to the con-
trol group. These low scores pre and post training are con-
sistent with previous studies for TMT-A (Guo, Zhou, Zhao,
Whang, & Hong, 2012; Wei et al., 2018; Zhao, Li, Lin, Wei,
& Yang, 2018) and TMT-B (Guo et al., 2012; Terada et al.,
2013; Wei et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018).
These findings confirm our hypothesis, according to which
the training group’s performance on standardized neuro-
psychological assessments was expected to be improved after
the intervention, when compared to its baseline performance.
Moreover, these results are in agreement with previous
research in MCI, according to which multidomain training
programs had a significant impact in delayed memory
(Hwang et al., 2012; Olchik et al., 2013; Savulich et al.,
2017), executive function and processing speed (Greenaway
et al., 2013), naming and semantic fluency (Gooding et al.,
2016; Rojas et al., 2013). On the other hand, the study by
Hwang et al. (2012) mentioned no statistical improvement
in patients with MCI, as far as recognition and working
memory is concerned (Hwang et al., 2012). Differences
regarding the intervention program, as well as the frequency
and the duration of the intervention sessions can possibly
account for the different findings.
According to our second hypothesis, the training group
was expected to demonstrate a better performance in most of
the trained domains compared to the controls. This hypoth-
esis was also supported, since the results revealed better per-
formance of the TG in all cognitive domains compared to the
controls, although in three out of the ten measures this per-
formance did not reach the significance threshold. These
results are in line with previous studies, where statistically sig-
nificant differences between the two groups were found in
some (Delbroek et al., 2017; Hwang et al., 2012) or even all
(Bahar-Fuchs et al., 2013; Gooding et al., 2016; Mansbach
et al., 2017) of the trained cognitive domains, with the trained
group revealing a better performance when compared to the
controls. Moreover, in order to evaluate the personal benefit
to each patient gained from the intervention, we informally
asked treated patients to provide feedback regarding the inter-
vention on verbal questions at the post intervention assess-
ment. Specifically, the TG mentioned positive feedback on
daily activities and functional communication.
Certain limitations, however, need to be acknowledged.
Firstly, the present study had a relatively short follow-up
period. Thus, a longer follow-up period would have allowed
for more robust and trustworthy results (Llewellyn-Bennett,
Bowman, & Bulbulia, 2016). Furthermore, considering the
relatively small sample size, our study might be underpowered
to examine the complete and absolute effect of computer-based
multidomain cognitive training on MCI. In addition, because
of the relatively small sample size, it was not feasible to assess
the effects of the intervention on MCI subtypes separately.
Future studies should examine whether patients with a specific
MCI subtype (i.e., amnestic MCI) may benefit more than other
subtypes from a multidomain cognitive training program.
Finally, a possible Hawthorne effect in the intervention cannot
be completely excluded (Sedgwick & Greenwood, 2015). Thus,
further studies applied to larger groups of patients are required
in order for the effect of computer-based multidomain cogni-
tive training and its clinical meaning on MCI patients to be
properly illustrated.
Conclusions
The present study demonstrates the beneficial impact of
computer-based multidomain cognitive training on the cog-
nitive performance of patients with MCI. Considering the
connection between MCI and AD, this data is promising for
developing training methods in order to restrict cognitive
decline or delay the progression of the disease to mild AD.
