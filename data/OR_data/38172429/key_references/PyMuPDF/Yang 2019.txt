Abstract
Background: memory training is a potential intervention for retaining memory and reducing dementia risk in older adults
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Objective: this study examined the effect of virtual interactive working memory training (VIMT) in older adults with MCI.
Design: single-blind, two-arm parallel-group, randomised controlled design.
Setting: retirement homes, institutions, and communities.
Subjects: a total of 66 older adults with MCI were recruited (mean age: 78.5 ± 7.6 years).
Methods: participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (VIMT, n = 33) or active control group (n = 33).
The VIMT program used the CogniPlus (includes four training modules). Both groups attended 45 min sessions 3 times
per week, a total of 36 sessions. The primary outcome was working memory; secondary outcomes were immediate memory,
delayed memory, subjective memory complaints and global cognitive function. All variables were measured at pre-test, post-
test, and 3-month follow-up.
Results: between group, the effect of working memory adjusted mean difference by 1.75 (95% CI: 0.56 to 2.94; P < 0.01)
at post-test. The results were analysed by a generalised estimating equation, which indicated that VIMT group signiﬁcantly
improved working memory at post-test (P = 0.01) relative to the active control group.
Conclusions: the applied VIMT program can enable older adults with MCI to maintain their working memory and reduce
the rate of cognitive deterioration.
Trial registration: This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (no.: NCT02462135).

Key points
• Memory impairment is the most easily detected symptom of cognitive changes in individuals.
• Memory is thus a critical clinical representation of cognitive function decline.
• Memory training, a theory-based method that entails providing adequate brain stimuli and boosting cognitive plasticity.
• This study examined whether virtual interactive working memory training (VIMT) program inﬂuence memory in older
adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
• VIMT program may be effective for improving working memory in older adults with MCI.
Introduction
The risk of dementia is higher in older adults with Mild cog-
nitive impairment (MCI) than in the general population, and
the rate of conversion of MCI to dementia is estimated at
5–20% [1]. Memory impairment is the most easily detected
symptom of cognitive changes; thus, memory is a critical clin-
ical representation of cognitive function decline [2].
Working memory is thought to be heavily dependent on
attention-based processes and/or the storage to carry out
tasks, and that’s been known generally considered a gateway
between short-term memory and long-term memory [3, 4].
Immediate memory refers to the recall of information
immediately after presentation and it is mainly used for
measuring short-term memory. Delayed memory refers to
the recall of material sometime after its presentation and is
usually used for measuring long-term memory. Studies sug-
gest that the risk of MCI and dementia in older adults with
subjective memory complaints is 4.5 times higher than in
those without such complaints; subjective memory com-
plaints are also reported to be signiﬁcantly correlated with
memory performance and global cognitive function [5–7].
Virtual interactive working memory training (VIMT) is
relatively novel and scalable intervention that aims to main-
tain memory in older adults. VIMT program is by means of
training programs that simulate real-life situations, helps
subjects to integrate their progress into everyday life using a
multimedia approach. VIMT, typically without explicit
teaching of memory or problem-solving strategies, which
distinguish this training modus from other approaches for
memory intervention. Recent meta-analyses of randomised
controlled trials of memory intervention have found moder-
ate effect sizes on cognition/memory in older adults [8–10].
A previous study indicated that 15–20% of older adults with
MCI showed improvements in cognitive function or effective
reductions in their risk of deteriorating cognitive function
after receiving cognitive-related interventions performed
1–2 years after MCI development [1].
Despite evidence that memory training is useful for
deferring declines in memory function, previous studies
have mostly recruited healthy older adults and not older
adults with MCI. Furthermore, only 37% of previous mem-
ory training studies were clinical trials and some did not
provide detailed information regarding their randomisation
and blinding [11–13].The effect of memory training on spe-
ciﬁc memory functions has not been adequately discussed.
The present single-blind randomised clinical trial was
designed as an intervention study. The objective of this
study was to examine the effects of a virtual interactive
working memory training (VIMT) program on working
memory, immediate memory, delayed memory, subjective
memory complaints, and global cognitive function in older
adults with MCI compared to an active control group.
Methodology
Study design
This study applied a randomised, single-blind, two-arm par-
allel-group design to examine changes in working memory,
immediate memory, delayed memory, subjective memory
complaints, and global cognitive function in post-test and
3-month follow-up between the two interventions. The
Regional
Ethics
Review
Board
of
Taipei
Medical
University’s Joint Institutional Review Board approved this
study (approval no.:201301045).
Participants
Older adults living in retirement homes, retirement institu-
tions, or
retirement communities were recruited and
enroled as participants. All data were collected between
August 2013 and July 2016. Inclusion criteria were: (1) self-
reported subjective memory complaints; (2) detection of
signiﬁcant memory impairment; (3) assessments of cogni-
tive function using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(MoCA) (At an optimal cut-off of below 23 for MCI and
below 17 for dementia) [14, 15] and (4) ability to perform
activities of daily living independently (assessment using the
Basic activities of daily living [BADL] and Instrumental
activities of daily living [IADL]). Exclusion criteria were:
(1) diagnosis of dementia; (2) severe mental disease or
behavioural problems; (3) rapid decline in cognitive or
physical function; (4) severe sensory function or commu-
nicative impairment; and (5) receipt of related cognition
or memory training in the preceding year. Before the
screening, subjects were informed of the study goals and
methods, and subjects who agreed to participate signed
the study consent forms. After providing informed con-
sent, participants were randomly assigned to either the

experimental group (VIMT) or the active control group
(Passive information activities [PIA]).
Randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding
The independent investigator generated a table of random
numbers using a computer and used block randomisation
(block size: 4), and placed the group assignment ﬁles in
sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE)
taken to conceal the sequence until interventions were
assigned (allocation ratio = 1:1). Participants were informed
beforehand that there were two intervention measures, they
were not being able to determine whether they were ran-
domly assigned to the VIMT group or the PIA group. The
participants were not blinded, i.e. they knew what group
they were allocated to and what treatment they were receiv-
ing. The assessors cannot discuss any study information
related to the participants with the therapists, and they do
not know which participants are receiving a genuine treat-
ment. The assessors only responsible for collecting data
during the study. All were kept blindness about which
group participants are in, until the data-collection phase of
the end.
Sample size calculation
Sample size was estimated using G-Power statistics software
[16]. Participants were assigned either to the VIMT group
or the PIA group (α = 0.05, power = 0.90, effect size =
0.45, drop-out rate = 21%) [17, 18]. Hence, oversampling
was performed to enrol 62 participants with MCI (i.e. 31
participants per group).
Interventions
The VIMT program was used as an intervention in the pre-
sent study. The VIMT program measures performance
using CogniPlus software (Schuhfried GmbH, Vienna,
Austria), which is a theory-based and scientiﬁcally-veriﬁed
intelligent interaction system designed for training cognitive
function. The training content was designed according to
the working memory model [3, 4].The experimental group
was subjected to a 45 min session 3 times per week for 12
weeks, for a total of 36 sessions. The training programmes
were implemented in an individual form. Each type of
working memory training was conducted over nine sessions.
The four working memory training modules applied in this
study are as follows:
(1) Updating—visual memory task: emphasises the
training of the visual cache in the visual–spatial sketchpad.
It is used to train the working memory monitoring function
and improve the ability to retain information while continu-
ously updating it. (2) Spatial encoding memory task: used to
train and improve monitoring processes and spatial coding
in the visual–spatial sketchpad. It is a basic working mem-
ory mechanism that involves cognitive function control and
coordination; it is regarded as the basis for complex cogni-
tive processes. (3) Rehearsal—visuospatial training task:
emphasises the training of the visual scribe in the visual–
spatial sketchpad. (4) Updating—spatial memory task: used
to train and improve the update function, a basic working
memory mechanism that involves control and target stimu-
lus repositioning. In this training module, three tasks must
be completed, namely running memory, keep-track, and
n-back. The four working memory training modules were
performed in sequence (see the training content of the
VIMT program in Appendix 1 of the online supplementary
data). VIMT modules was used to improve rehearsal abil-
ities and assist trainees to practice retrieval and re-encoding
under self-control and attentional control.
The active control group in the PIA intervention using a
tablet computer. The contents of the control training pro-
gram included reading online e-books and playing online
games, such as puzzles, spot the differences, etc.…, and the
training frequency was being identical (45 min sessions 3
times per week for 12 weeks, a total of 36 sessions) [19].
Outcome measures
The primary outcome was the working memory. Working
memory was measured using the digit span (DS)—back-
ward task to assess working memory [20]. Secondary out-
comes
were
immediate
memory,
delayed
memory,
subjective memory complaints, and global cognitive func-
tion. The immediate memory and delayed memory scores
were calculated using the Wechsler Memory Scale—Third
Edition (WMS-III) [20]. Immediate memory comprises
immediate memory, auditory immediate memory, and visual
immediate memory. Delayed memory comprises delayed
memory, auditory delayed memory, and visual delayed
memory. All scores were derived from age-standardised
scores in the individual scales. Subjective memory complaints,
which were determined using the Multifactorial Memory
Questionnaire (MMQ). The MMQ consists of three subtests
(ability, strategy, and contentment) [21]. Global cognitive func-
tion was evaluated using the Mini-Mental Status Examination
(MMSE) [22] and the MoCA [14, 15].
Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-
treat (ITT) principle. Data from all randomly-assigned partici-
pants were included in the ﬁnal statistical analysis [23, 24] and
analysed using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Each participant had three time point measures: pre-test,
post-test,and three-month follow-up. The data were analysed
using independent t-tests and Chi-square tests. For all out-
come measures, between-group differences in mean changes
from baseline to each time point (post-test and three-month
follow-up)
were
analysed

the differences between the two groups (Repeated measures

analysis provide estimations of changes from baseline.
Missing data will use multiple imputation (MI) of imputation
to estimate. The signiﬁcance level was < 0.05 (two-tailed).
Results
Sample characteristics
Ninety-three adults participated in this study. Participants
were randomly assigned to the VIMT group (n = 33) or
PIA group (n = 33). The difference of age in baseline was
adjusted using multivariate generalised linear models. No
signiﬁcant differences were detected in other baseline data
(Table 1). The total dropout rate of this study was 4.5%,
1 (0.03%) participant from the VIMT group and 2 (0.06%)
participants from the PIA group had dropped out. The rea-
sons for dropping out were leaving the residence and hospi-
talisation (Fig 1). None of the participants exhibited adverse
reactions during the training.
Outcome measures
Table 2 presents the results of all outcome measures at pre-
test, post-test, and three-month follow-up. At post-test, the
VIMT group showed statistically signiﬁcant difference com-
pared to the PIA group on working memory, subjective
memory complaints (MMQ Strategy), and globe cognitive
function (MMSE); At three-month follow-up, the VIMT
group is statistically signiﬁcant different from the PIA
group on the globe cognitive function (MoCA) (difference =
2.27 points, 95% CI = 0.18 to 4.37, P = 0.03) (Table 2).
The effectiveness of the interventions were observed in the
GEE analysis results, where a signiﬁcant time × group inter-
action effect was discerned in the effect of the VIMT program
on post-test DS scores (P = 0.01), which were superior to
those of the PIA group (Appendix 2 , available in Age and
Ageing
online).
Therefore,
VIMT
engendered
signiﬁcant
improvements in working memory. The secondary outcome

subjective memory complaints and global cognitive function.
The GEE analysis results did not show any effect of the
VIMT program on all secondary outcomes at post-test and
three-month-follow-up (Appendix 2 and 3, available in Age and
Ageing online), but the means of these variables exhibited short-
term stable trends and no signs of decline (Table 2).
Discussion
Working memory training relies on memory processes and
strategies to strengthen recall capacity, which can be trained
via two general mechanisms: enhanced working memory
capacity or efﬁciency. Multiple factors may inﬂuence
mechanisms mediating transfer effects and success of train-
ing interventions, such as the training program and individ-
ual differences [10, 11, 25]. Working memory is crucial for
processing daily needs, particularly those needs pertaining
to information retention, representations of cognitive pro-
cessing, and task implementation, such as remembering a
phone number or understanding long and difﬁcult sen-
tences. DS-backward exhibited a higher correlation with
working memory compared with DS-forward, as DS-
backward requires individuals to recall a sequence in reverse
order while coding the numbers that are heard, which is a
relatively difﬁcult task. Immediate and delayed memory
were found to be highly correlated with cognitive impair-
ment; delayed memory was also conﬁrmed as an effective
predictor of MCI progression to dementia. The results of
the present study are consistent with previous ﬁndings,
which concluded that memory training have signiﬁcant
effects in older adults, suggesting that cognitive plasticity is
preserved in old age [26–28]. However, participants of PIA
group were signiﬁcantly older in this study, they may have
exhibited lesser training gains and cognitive plasticity com-
pared to VIMT group.
In accordance with the Consolidated Standards of
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, this rigorously
designed study showed that working memory training (i.e.
VIMT) can enable older adults with MCI to maintain their
cognitive or memory status and reduce the rate of cognitive
deterioration. By strengthening working memory, can help
individuals memorise information more easily (e.g. phone
numbers) when they are provided with information stimuli
in daily settings. Older adults with MCI can further motiv-
ate the continued acquisition of memory function and the
use of new memory strategies by the training program.
However, the study was followed only three-month follow-
up, future studies were required with long term follow-up
and more outcome measures of transfer effect, i.e. function,
mood, quality of life, other cognitive domains such as:
visuospatial abilities, attention etc…, which further veriﬁes
the prevented progression to dementia and reduction of
hazards in daily life. Booster sessions can be seen as one of
the strategies to sustain the long-term effects of training.
The main contributions of this study are as follows. First,
this is the ﬁrst study in Chinese population to develop a
systematic
training
model
(i.e.
the
VIMT
program)
speciﬁcally for older adults with MCI. Training software
was applied to offer specialised training conditions depend-
ing on each participant’s characteristics and enabled the
researcher to immediately and objectively compare data
using real-time feedback. Second, VIMT program is more
cost-effective and personalised than traditional memory
training. It is easy to operate. Subjects are required to press
one button only to respond in the training procedure. Thus,
the training doesn’t operate difﬁcult for older adults to
accomplish and adapts task difﬁculty to individual perform-
ance. Finally, this study applied a wide range of memory-
related outcome measures for a detailed analysis of the
effectiveness of intervention. This study has several limita-
tions. The working memory training may beneﬁt older
adults, but regarding training and transfer effects in older
adults may be more complex and restricted compared with
younger participants. Although an effective sample size was
used in the study, the sample size should be further
increased to examine the dose–response effect of training
and transfer effects (e.g. training sessions, duration) [29, 30].
In addition, lack of blinding of participants in this study.
Therefore, we were recommended that the groups are trea-
ted as equally possible, such as provided the training fre-
quency was being identical.
The systematic training model (the VIMT program)
applied in this study can be applied in institutions or commu-
nities and incorporated into regular activities and long-term
programmes to provide comprehensive care services to help
delay the progression of cognitive and memory loss in older
adults. Further research is required to conﬁrm these ﬁndings
and establish if there is a clinically worthwhile beneﬁt.
