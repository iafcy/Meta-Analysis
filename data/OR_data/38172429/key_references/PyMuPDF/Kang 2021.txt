Abstract
Background: 
Cognitive training can potentially prevent cognitive decline. However, the results of recent studies using
semi-immersive virtual reality (VR)-assisted cognitive training are inconsistent.
Objective: 
We aimed to examine the hypothesis that cognitive training using fully immersive VR, which may facilitate
visuospatial processes, could improve visuospatial functioning, comprehensive neuropsychological functioning, psychiatric
symptoms, and functional connectivity in the visual brain network in predementia.
Methods: Participants over 60 years old with subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment from a memory clinic
were randomly allocated to the VR (n=23) or the control (n=18) group. The VR group participants received multidomain and
neuropsychologist-assisted cognitive training in a fully immersive VR environment twice a week for 1 month. The control group
participants did not undergo any additional intervention except for their usual therapy such as pharmacotherapy. Participants of
both groups were evaluated for cognitive function using face-to-face comprehensive neuropsychological tests, including the
Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT) copy task; for psychiatric symptoms such as depression, apathy, affect, and quality
of life; as well as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) at baseline and after training. Repeated-measures
analysis of variance was used to compare the effect of cognitive training between groups. Seed-to-voxel–based analyses were
used to identify the cognitive improvement–related functional connectivity in the visual network of the brain.
Results: After VR cognitive training, significant improvement was found in the total score (F1,39=14.69, P=.001) and basic
components score of the RCFT copy task (F1,39=9.27, P=.005) compared with those of the control group. The VR group also
showed improvements, albeit not significant, in naming ability (F1,39=3.55, P=.07), verbal memory delayed recall (F1,39=3.03,
P=.09), and phonemic fluency (F1,39=3.08, P=.09). Improvements in psychiatric symptoms such as apathy (F1,39=7.02, P=.01),

affect (F1,39=14.40, P=.001 for positive affect; F1,39=4.23, P=.047 for negative affect), and quality of life (F1,39=4.49, P=.04) were
found in the VR group compared to the control group. Improvement in the RCFT copy task was associated with a frontal-occipital
functional connectivity increase revealed by rsfMRI in the VR group compared to the control group.
Conclusions: Fully immersive VR cognitive training had positive effects on the visuospatial function, apathy, affect, quality
of life, and increased frontal-occipital functional connectivity in older people in a predementia state. Future trials using VR
cognitive training with larger sample sizes and more sophisticated designs over a longer duration may reveal greater improvements
in cognition, psychiatric symptoms, and brain functional connectivity.

Introduction
Dementia is a major neurodegenerative disorder, affecting
approximately 10% of older people [1]. Cognitive,
psychological, and behavioral deterioration are typical
manifestations of dementia, ultimately resulting in functional
impairments and disability [2]. The individual and societal
burden of dementia is accelerating rapidly compared to other
diseases [1,3]; however, due to the unclear mechanisms and
multifactorial pathology underlying the development and
progression of dementia, only symptomatic treatments are
currently available [4].
To date, many researchers have suggested that prevention is
crucial, and have identified risk and protective factors associated
with dementia, as well as preventive strategies [5]. According
to a recent large study, one-third of Alzheimer disease (AD)
cases are attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors such
as educational attainment, vascular factors, and depression [6].
Additionally, lifelong exposure to cognitively and mentally
engaging activities has been shown to protect against cognitive
decline [7], and performance of cognitively stimulating activities
in advanced age was associated with better cognitive function
[8]. Accordingly, recent cognitive training studies have shown
that repeated practice of exercises to restore brain and cognitive
reserves resulted in small to moderate positive improvements
in cognition in patients with mild to moderate dementia [9].
Advances in computer sciences and information and
communication technology (ICT) have resulted in increased
availability and accessibility of computerized cognitive training.
Although conclusive results have yet to be found, preliminary
studies have reported improvements in trained and nontrained
cognition, and enhanced brain activity in related regions after
computerized cognitive training in individuals with mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) [10-12]. Working memory training
was effective in improving verbal memory and hippocampal
activation in patients with MCI [11], and exposure to a driving
video game resulted in increased ability to control the vehicle
that was related to midline frontal theta power in older people
[12]. Moreover, emerging ICT applications using virtual reality
(VR) have resulted in evolutions in health care, including
cognitive and behavioral therapy [13]. VR can offer
interventions in flexible and real world–like environments,
facilitating visuospatial function through learning and
transference outcomes [14], highlighting a role for cognitive
training in a virtual environment in basic research and clinical
practice. Owing to the lack of knowledge and dearth of
experiments on VR-based cognitive training, especially the fully
immersive type [15,16], further studies are needed to ascertain
its potential therapeutic efficacy.
Recently, the number of neuroimaging studies attempting to
reveal the underlying neural mechanisms associated with
cognitive decline has increased [17,18]. Functional connectivity
studies using resting-state functional magnetic resonance
imaging (rsfMRI) have identified networks temporally
coinciding with spatially distant neurophysiological events that
are intrinsically coherent during a resting state such as the
default-mode network [19]. We considered that functional
connectivity studies using rsfMRI may be able to reveal the
neural mechanism, especially in the visual network, responsible
for the observed cognitive improvements following VR
cognitive training, as such training is based on the cognitive
reserve hypothesis associated with functional neural networks
[20].
To test this hypothesis, we performed a preliminary randomized
controlled trial to determine the efficacy and mechanisms of
VR cognitive training in a predementia state. We aimed to
ascertain the effects of VR multidomain cognitive training on
visuospatial function, comprehensive neuropsychological
function, and psychiatric symptoms in predementia. Moreover,
we examined the hypothesis that cognitive improvement could
be related to increased functional connectivity in the visual
network of the brain.
Methods
Participants
Participants over 60 years old in a predementia state (ranging
from subjective cognitive decline to MCI) were prospectively
recruited between May and December 2019 from the memory
clinic of Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Republic of
Korea. Among 58 individuals who were assessed for eligibility
using structured clinical interviews and brain MRI, four
participants were excluded due to cerebral infarction on MRI
(n=2), severe white matter hyperintensity on MRI (n=1), and
history of a recent dental implant surgery (n=1). Nine
participants voluntarily withdrew from the study due to an acute

medical condition (n=2), hospitalization of a family member
(n=1), scheduling conflict (n=1), and unknown personal reasons
(n=5). Finally, a total of 45 participants were randomly assigned
to either the VR group or the control group.
All participants had subjective cognitive complaints, including
memory decline, but did not meet the criteria for diagnosis of
a major neurocognitive disorder based on the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition) [2].
Participants were classified as having subjective cognitive
decline according to the corresponding research criteria and
five cognitive domain scores such as attention, language,
visuospatial, memory, and frontal executive functions above
–1.5 SD [21,22]. Participants were classified as having MCI
according to the Petersen criteria [23]. Screening evaluation of
the participants was performed by a board-certified psychiatrist
(JK) and a clinical neuropsychologist (SL).
The exclusion criteria for the participants were as follows: (i)
Korean version of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
score <20; (ii) impaired activities of daily living; (iii)
comorbidity of severe medical or surgical conditions; (iv) major
psychiatric disorders; (v) history of any kind of dementia; (vi)
history 
of 
neurodegenerative 
disorders, 
including
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Pick disease, Huntington disease,
Parkinson disease, inflammation associated with HIV, and
syphilis; (vii) structural abnormalities on MRI such as
intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral, cerebellar, or brainstem
infarction, hydrocephalus, traumatic brain injury, severe white
matter hyperintensity, tumors, multiple sclerosis, or vasculitis;
and (viii) inability to use the VR system.
Information on study objectives, group allocation, cognitive
intervention, brief study protocol, risks and benefits, and
confidentiality was given to all participants before enrollment.
All participants provided offline written informed consent, and
the Institutional Review Board of Gachon University Gil
Medical Center approved this study (GCIRB2018-396).
Study Design
This was an open-label, randomized controlled trial
(KCT0005243) that aimed to investigate the efficacy of a fully
immersive VR cognitive training program on visuospatial
function in older people with risk for dementia (Multimedia
Appendix 1). Participants were randomly assigned to either the
VR or the control group. The unblinded randomization was
performed by drawing lots with the participants present.
Participants in both groups were evaluated for visuospatial
function, comprehensive neuropsychological function, and
psychiatric symptoms, and underwent rsfMRI before and after
the 1-month cognitive training. The participants in the VR group
underwent VR cognitive training twice a week for a total of
eight sessions in addition to their usual therapy such as
pharmacotherapy for the prevention of dementia (eg, choline
alfoscerate and cholinesterase inhibitor); the participants in the
control group did not undergo any additional intervention except
for their usual therapy such as pharmacotherapy.
VR Cognitive Training
The multidomain VR cognitive training program was developed
between November 2018 and April 2019 by the authors who
are board-certified geriatric neuropsychiatrists and clinical
neuropsychologists with expertise. The VR cognitive training
program consisted of multiple games involving multidomain
cognitive tasks to assess: (i) attention (to find differences), (ii)
executive function and memory (to select items needed to
perform certain tasks), (iii) working memory and ability to
perform mathematical calculations (to prepare an exact amount
of money), (iv) visuospatial orientation (to find a path using a
memorized map), (v) visuospatial function (to spatially place
furniture exactly based on a memorized drawing), (vi) verbal
memory (to remember certain words), (vii) visual memory (to
remember specific flags and symbols), and (viii) processing
speed and working memory (to catch animals in a certain order).
All virtual environments were fully immersive 3D settings
allowing for feelings of increased presence and visuospatial
stimulation; training was accompanied by game elements to
increase the interest and motivation of the participants.
Representative images of the VR training program are presented
in Multimedia Appendix 2.
Each session lasted approximately 20-30 minutes. The VR
training took place using a head-mounted Oculus Rift CV1
display, with Oculus Touch controllers held in both of the
participant’s hands. Each training session was performed with
the participant in a seated position, and the difficulty level
increased throughout the study period from easy to difficult
(levels 1-4), with two sessions at each difficulty level. All
procedures were performed in the memory clinic of Gachon
University Gil Medical Center and were guided by a certified
clinical neuropsychologist (SL) in addition to automatic verbal
and visual messages from the program. There were no revisions,
updates, or breaches of the program during the study period.
This program was used exclusively in this study and is not
available for commercial use.
Procedures and Outcome Measures
All participants underwent face-to-face comprehensive
neuropsychological tests and evaluations using psychiatric
scales, as well as rsfMRI at baseline and after the VR cognitive
training period. Baseline evaluations of diagnostic criteria
included global and functional scales such as the Korean version
of the MMSE, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), CDR Sum of
Boxes (CDR-SOB), global deterioration scale, and instrumental
activities of daily living scales.
The primary outcome was the effect of the VR cognitive training
on visuospatial function measured by the Rey-Osterrieth
Complex Figure Test (RCFT) copy task, which has been
validated in the Korean population [24,25]. Basic components,
including a large rectangle (1 point), diagonal cross (1 point),
horizontal midline of a large rectangle (1 point), and vertical
midline of a large rectangle (1 point), were also evaluated
because they are considered important in qualitative aspects
[26,27]. The neuropsychologist (GP) who scored the RCFT
copy task was blinded to the randomization.
The secondary outcomes concerned the effect on comprehensive
neuropsychological function; psychiatric symptoms such as
affect, apathy, quality of life (QoL), and depression; and
functional connectivity in the visual network of the brain.

The neuropsychological tests consisted of the MMSE and
subtests from the comprehensive neuropsychological test battery
[25]. Attention was assessed by the digit span forward and
backward test and Trail Making Test (TMT) part A [25]. The
Korean version of the Boston Naming Test (K-BNT) was used
to assess language ability [25,28]. Memory was assessed by
measuring performance on three tasks of the Seoul Verbal
Learning Test (SVLT): immediate recall, delayed recall after
20 minutes, and recognition [25]. Frontal executive function
was assessed by phonemic word fluency testing, the TMT-B,
and the Stroop Color Test [25]. All neuropsychological test
results were adjusted for age and years of education, and are
presented as standardized z-scores.
Noncognitive psychiatric symptoms that typically start to decline
in the early dementia stage were also assessed [29]. Depressive
symptoms were evaluated by the validated 30-item Geriatric
Depression Scale (GDS), including questions pertaining to
mood, anxiety, energy, satisfaction, hopefulness, inattention,
and sleep quality [30,31]. The GDS comprises a series of binary
yes/no questions (scored as 1 or 0, respectively), with higher
scores indicating severe depression. Apathy was evaluated by
the validated 18-item Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), including
items pertaining to emotional affect, behavior, and cognitive
apathy [32,33]. Items of the AES are rated on a 4-point Likert
scale, with a low score indicating severe apathy. Affect was
evaluated by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule
(PANAS), which consists of 10 items to assess positive affect
(PANAS-P) measures such as alertness and enthusiasm and 10
items to assess negative affect (PANAS-N) such as lethargy
and feelings of sadness [34,35]. Each of the PANAS items is
rated from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much), with higher scores
indicating higher affect. Participants’ QoL was evaluated by
the QoL-AD scale, which has been validated for use in people
with dementia, including 13 subjective rating items to assess
physical health, living situation, relationships with friends, and
the ability to engage in leisure activities [36,37]. Items of the
QoL-AD are assessed on a 4-point Likert scale, with higher
scores indicating better QoL.
The Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) was administered
after each session to evaluate tolerability of the VR cognitive
training program [38]. Simulator sickness refers to side effects
from virtual environment usage, and is also called cybersickness
[39,40] and VR sickness [41]. The SSQ consists of 16 items
yielding three subscales (nausea, oculomotor, and disorientation)
and a total severity score, with high scores indicating increased
symptoms. The levels of interest and satisfaction were also
assessed on a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 100 after the period
of VR cognitive training in a face-to-face manner.
MRI Acquisition
A 3-Tesla whole-body Siemens scanner (TrioTim syngo) was
used for functional image acquisition with an interleaved
T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging gradient echo sequence
(repetition time/echo time=2500/25 milliseconds, flip angle=90°,
slice thickness=3.5 mm, in-plane resolution=3.5×3.5 mm, matrix
size=64×64) with a 12-channel birdcage head coil. For each
participant, 160 functional volumes were acquired at the
pretraining and posttraining time points. After rsfMRI, an
anatomical image was acquired using a high T1-weighted
3D-gradient echo pulse sequence with magnetization-prepared
rapid gradient echo (repetition time/echo time/inversion
time=1900/3.3/900 
milliseconds, 
flip 
angle=9°, 
slice
thickness=1.0 mm, in-plane resolution=0.5×0.5 mm, matrix
size=416×512). T1-weighted images were acquired only at the
pretraining time point.
Functional Connectivity Analyses With rsfMRI
Preprocessing of the rsfMRI data was performed using Statistical
Parametric Mapping software version 12 (Wellcome Trust
Centre for Neuroimaging). First, a slice-timing correction was
applied and the center of each image was relocated near the
anterior commissure. Second, rsfMRI and T1-weighted images
were imported into CONN FC toolbox v19c [42] for further
preprocessing. To correct for between-scan rigid body motion,
the functional images were realigned to the first image in the
time series. The functional images were coregistered with
anatomical images and spatially normalized to the Montreal
Neurological Institute space using a transformation matrix
derived from the T1-weighted anatomical image segmentation.
The functional images were then resliced to 2×2×2 mm and
spatially smoothed using an 8-mm full width at half maximum
Gaussian kernel.
All preprocessed rsfMRI images were bandpass-filtered
(0.008-0.09 Hz), and physiological and other spurious noise
sources in the blood oxygenation level–dependent signal were
removed using the anatomical component-based noise correction
strategy implemented in CONN [43]. Outliers were calculated
using the Artifact Detection Tools toolbox [44], and six motion
correction parameters obtained from realignment were also
modeled as nuisance covariates. The seed-to-voxel analyses
were performed in the visual network with four cortical seed
regions (right visual lateral, left visual lateral, visual medial,
and visual occipital cortices) with predefined regions of interest
based on the Harvard-Oxford atlas (fMRIB Software Library)
[45]. Seed-based analyses were adjusted for age, years of
education, sex, CDR-SOB, depressive symptoms, and
pharmacotherapy. The mean time series for each seed region
was calculated and then correlated with the time courses of all
other voxels in the brain for each participant.
Sample Calculation and Statistical Analyses
Sample calculation was based on a recent meta-analysis on the
effectiveness of VR for people with MCI or dementia that
produced small-to-medium effect sizes using a random-effects
model (effect size=0.29) from a total of 11 studies [15].
Assuming an attrition rate of 20%, a total sample size of 32
patients (16 per treatment group) would provide 0.8 power at
a two-sided α error of .05. Power analysis was performed with
G*Power software version 3.1.9.2.
Comparisons of demographic and clinical variables between
the two groups were performed using independent t tests, the
Mann-Whitney U test, or the χ2 test. The paired t test was used
in within-group comparisons of pretraining and posttraining
measures. Repeated-measures analyses of variance was used to
find the group interaction of the VR cognitive training on
neuropsychological function and psychiatric symptom scales

after adjusting for age, years of education, sex, CDR-SOB,
depressive symptoms, and pharmacotherapy. Age and years of
education were not adjusted in analyses with comprehensive
neuropsychological test results that are presented as age- and
years of education–adjusted z-scores. All statistical analyses
were performed with SPSS software version 23 (SPSS Inc),
with a significance level assessed at P<.05 (two-tailed).
For rsfMRI data, Pearson correlation coefficients were converted
to normally distributed scores using the Fisher r-to-z
transformation. Group-level comparisons between the VR and
control groups were performed using a general linear model in
which improved cognitive task score was used as an explanatory
variable and the posttraining minus pretraining z-transformation
value was used as a dependent variable after adjusting for age,
sex, years of education, CDR-SOB, depressive symptoms, and
pharmacotherapy. The statistical thresholds for significance
were set at voxel-wise uncorrected P<.001 and cluster-wise
corrected P<.05 to correct for false-positive rates.
Results
Participants
Of the 45 participants who were randomly allocated to the VR
(n=25) or the control (n=20) group, 41 participants completed
the study. After allocation, two participants of the VR group
dropped out of the study due to dizziness (n=1) and unfamiliarity
with the VR machine during the first session (n=1). Two
participants of the control group dropped out because of
hospitalization due to a traffic accident (n=1) and unknown
personal reasons (n=1). Ultimately, 41 participants were
included in the analyses. The trial flow chart is presented in
Figure 1.

Increased Functional Connectivity in rsfMRI
We investigated brain functional connectivity in the visual
network associated with the improvement in the RCFT copy
task. The areas with significantly increased connectivity in the
seed-to-voxel visual networks are presented in Table 6: (a) from
the right visual lateral cortices to the left paracingulate gyrus,
right paracingulate gyrus, left frontal pole, left superior frontal
gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, and white matter; and (b) from
the visual medial cortices to the right insular cortex, right frontal
pole, right frontal operculum cortex, right caudate, left caudate,
right putamen, left insular cortex, and white matter.
Figure 2 depicts the increased regional functional connectivity
in the brain cortices and the white matter that are related to
improvements in the RCFT copy task in the VR group compared

Discussion
Principal Findings
This study found that 1-month multidomain cognitive training
using fully immersive VR was effective in improving
visuospatial 
function 
and 
frontal-occipital 
functional
connectivity, as well as apathy, affect, and QoL in older people
in a predementia cognitive state.
The first major finding of this study is that VR cognitive training
resulted in improvements in the RCFT copy task. Despite the
inconsistent results reported in the literature, training-related
changes in cognition have been repeatedly found in older people
with cognitive disorders [9,10]. Neuropsychological test score
improvements after traditional pen-and-paper or computerized
cognitive training have been found in measures of global
composite cognition [46-48], verbal memory [11,46,49,50],
verbal letter fluency [46,47], verbal fluency [51,52], and
visuospatial function in the clock-drawing test [46,53]. It has
also been reported that VR cognitive training was effective in
improving frontal executive function in individuals with MCI
[54], as well as attention and visual memory in older people
[55,56]. In line with these previous studies, our results also
showed that multidomain cognitive training in a virtual
environment was effective in visuospatial function measured
by the RCFT copy task in total and basic components
comprising the gestalt of the feature showing the ability to
approach [26,27]. Although not significant, improvements in
naming ability, verbal memory delayed recall, and frontal
executive function were also found in the training group
compared to the control group. It is possible that the relatively
short 1-month training period might have resulted in the lack
of group difference, as a learning effect may have impacted the
posttraining neuropsychological test results in the control group.
However, the improvement in visuospatial function in the VR
group, even after the short period of cognitive training, might
be attributed to the ecological nature of the fully immersive VR
environment. In the enriched auditorily and visually stimulating
environment, processing of visual orientation, visuospatial
construction, and visual selective attention likely occurred
[57,58]. In recent studies with VR evaluation, investigators have
been able to effectively differentiate between the navigational
[59] and visuospatial deficits observed in patients with MCI
and healthy older people [60,61]. In studies with VR
interventions, VR cognitive training was found to be effective
[55,62] or ineffective [56,63] in improving visuospatial function

in older people or those in an early dementia stage. We believe
that the cognitive training performed in the maximally
immersive environment with the head-mounted display,
headphones, and hand movement trackers in our study might
have increased visuospatial functioning in those at a predementia
stage [64]. The immersion methods utilized in previous studies
investigating VR cognitive training in older people have
employed desktop-based systems [55,56], screen and sensors
[62], screen and glasses [65,66], and head-mounted display and
fixed joystick setups [63]. Although heterogeneity in study
populations and methodological differences among prior studies
have resulted in inconsistent findings, this study provides further
evidence to support the benefits of VR cognitive training in
eliciting improvements in visuospatial processing through the
repeated presentation of real-world, dynamic, multisensory, and
interactive environments.
Another novel finding was the increased functional connectivity
observed in the frontal-occipital cortical network after VR
cognitive training, which was associated with improved
performance in the RCFT copy task, consistent with the
associations between cognitive improvements and neuronal
plasticity that have been observed previously [67]. In patients
with MCI, significant associations have been observed between
verbal memory improvement and left hippocampal activation
in task-related fMRI after 8-week training to improve auditory
processing speed and accuracy [11]. Other studies have shown
that 6 weeks of episodic memory training in patients with MCI
resulted in the manifestation of new associations between
improved delayed word recall test performance and brain
activation in the right inferior parietal lobule in fMRI during
memory encoding [68]. In healthy older people, 8 weeks of
exposure to a cognitive control training program led to an
increased frontoparietal network related to cognitive control
ability [69]; another study found that verbal recall was associated
with an increased left hippocampal volume in healthy older
people after 8 weekly verbal recall memory training sessions
[70]. Thus, in this study, repetitive cognitive training in a novel
fully immersive environment might have increased the
frontal-occipital activation in accordance with improved
visuospatial function. We also observed increased functional
connectivity in white matter areas, which are known to exhibit
a lower hemodynamic response than the grey matter. Although
fMRI studies have focused on grey matter until recently, the
increased functional connectivity in the white matter close to
the grey matter supports the growing neural evidence of fMRI
white matter changes induced by VR cognitive training [71,72].
This evident link between visuospatial construction and
frontal-occipital functional connectivity might be explained by
the acquired cognitive system engagement induced by the RCFT
copy task, which requires the participant to copy a complex
geometric figure [73]. Visuoconstructive ability is based on the
Van Sommers model of drawing [74]; according to this cognitive
model, the RCFT copy task consists of (i) visual recognition of
a 2D Rey-Osterrieth complex figure; (ii) visual representation
of the figure in long-term or temporary memory; (iii) graphical
output processes such as those related to depiction decisions
(eg, context, orientation, viewpoint, details, and boundary) or
reproduction strategies (eg, copying orders, dimensions, shapes,
diagonals, crosses, line sets); (iv) graphical planning (eg, routine
or contingent planning); and (v) articulation and economic
constraints during motor output. Through these steps, multiple
brain regions have been found to be associated with performance
in the RCFT copy task, including the temporal, parietal,
occipital, and frontal cortices in both hemispheres or in the right
hemisphere alone [75-77]. Although we observed increased
activity only in the primary visual cortices (visual medial) and
the right associative visual cortices (right visual lateral)
connecting to the areas in the middle frontal cortices, these
regions are known to be involved in the visual recognition and
graphic output planning processes required to complete the
RCFT copy task [74], and are associated with visuo-motor
transformation and multistep object use in the task [77]. A recent
study reported that lesions in the right superior parietal lobe and
the middle occipital gyrus were associated with poor RCFT
copy task performance [78], which is in accordance with our
results. Furthermore, there have been reports on improvements
in nontrained cognitive functions, also known as transfer effects,
in memory training in older people with MCI [79,80]. Previous
studies have shown that repeated memory-focused training
might have enhanced the processing speed of memory retrieval
and the efficiency of working memory, assuming that frontal
executive function was the main recipient of the transfer effects
[79,80]. Although recent studies have applied cognitive training
with novel computerized tools and involvement of multiple
cognitive domains, existing programs have only applied
cognitive training in a 2D environment with an emphasis on
language abilities [9,53,79,81]. Since frontal executive function
plays a major role in all cognitive domains and higher-order
cognitive controls [82], the improved performance on the RCFT
copy task may be supported by increased functional connectivity
in the frontal-occipital network.
The psychiatric benefit of VR cognitive training in individuals
in a predementia state should be considered. In this study,
participants in the VR group showed improved apathy, affect,
and QoL scores after training compared with those in the control
group. A recent review reported that computerized cognitive
training resulted in long-term improvements in psychological
outcome measures [16]. Although methodologies vary across
studies, 3D VR cognitive training was effective in improving
depressive symptoms in patients with MCI compared with an
active control group receiving music therapy [63]. Moreover,
a few feasibility studies have reported improved alertness,
pleasure, apathy, and security following one-time exposure to
a less immersive VR environment [65,66]. We postulate that
apathy, affect, and QoL might be improved by the VR cognitive
training, as these are some of the early symptoms of dementia
[83]. Immersive virtual environments might facilitate the limited
functioning of patients with cognitive disorders that affect
communication, interaction, motivation, engagement, and
positive attitudes toward others [84]. Thus, the importance of
virtual environments should be considered in cognitive training
because the feeling of presence itself in a 3D space can enhance
volitional motivation, allowing one to constantly process
external stimuli and cognitively adjust to changing environments
[85].

Simulator sickness reported after every session was minimal in
the VR cognitive training group. In this study, the SSQ total
score (mean 12.86, SD 11.82) indicated minimal symptoms
(score 5-10) according to the suggested categorization
established in flight simulators [86]. Although the SSQ was
originally developed and validated in military personnel using
flight simulators, it is the most commonly used measure of
sickness in a virtual environment [40]. A recent meta-analysis
of the SSQ in virtual environments reported total and subscale
scores and dropout rates according to VR conditions (total 28.00,
SD 1.71; nausea 16.72, SD 0.77; oculomotor 17.09, SD 0.55;
disorientation 23.50, SD 1.17; dropout rate 15.6%) [87].
Compared to the results in a VR environment, our results on
the SSQ scores and dropout rates (8%) showed better
tolerability, with moderate interest and satisfaction. The SSQ
scores have been reported to be higher in VR than in a flight
simulator environment [86] and with gaming content than
without it [87]. Despite the characteristics of VR in this study,
such as fully immerse, game and training components, and old
users at an early stage of cognitive decline, these results may
imply that fully immersive VR can be a safe and interesting
method for cognitive training.
Limitations
Our study had several strengths and limitations. This is one of
the largest VR cognitive training studies to use a fully immersive
3D VR program. Compared to 2D or semi-immersive VR
programs, our results highlight the positive effects of employing
fully immersive 3D VR in cognitive training, as we found neural
evidence supporting the improvement in visuospatial function.
However, there are several limitations and lessons learned in
this study. First, the small sample size and short training period
were the main limitations. Although sample sizes in studies
investigating the effects of cognitive training are increasing
[88], most VR trials still rely on small sample sizes and are
performed over a short duration, especially those using fully
virtual environments [15]. Short clinical trial periods in previous
studies investigating the effect of computerized cognitive
training programs have also been a limiting factor in the field
as a whole [88]. Thus, future studies should aim to increase the
sample sizes and extend the duration of training to better
evaluate the effect of VR cognitive training. Second, we
considered that the per-protocol analysis could bias the results
of this randomized controlled trial, although the number of
participants who dropped out of the study was the same in both
groups. Third, the lack of an active control group in this study
is another limitation. Some previous trials have included active
control groups receiving psychoeducation, cognitive therapy,
face-to-face music therapy, or pen-and-paper cognitive training
for comparisons with the VR training group [15,63]. In the
future, various active control groups should be considered to
confirm the effectiveness of VR cognitive training. Fourth, the
lack of examination for AD biomarkers such as cerebrospinal
fluid analysis or brain imaging for amyloid detection can be a
limitation because it is unclear whether the participants in our
study will develop AD, which is the most prevalent cause of
dementia. Future studies involving AD biomarkers could clearly
explain the pure effect of cognitive training in individuals in a
preclinical or prodromal dementia state. Lastly, heterogeneity
among patients, practitioners, program content, and accessibility
to the VR system can limit the generalizability of the results to
other populations.
Conclusions
We found that fully immersive VR cognitive training improved
cognition and psychiatric symptoms in a predementia state.
Visuospatial function improved in such individuals relative to
controls, and this finding was supported by increased
frontal-occipital functional connectivity assessed by rsfMRI.
These findings suggest that VR training can enhance visuospatial
ability by exposing patients to an enriched virtual environment,
leading to improved apathy, affect, and QoL. Our results support
the neurotherapeutic use of VR cognitive training as an effective
nonpharmacological intervention for those who are at risk for
dementia; however, more rigorous trials should be performed
to confirm the effects and identify the associated neural
mechanisms.
