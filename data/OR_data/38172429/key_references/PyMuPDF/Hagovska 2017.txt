Comparison of Two Cognitive Training Programs With 
Effects on Functional Activities and Quality of Life
Magdaléna Hagovská, PhD; Oliver Dzvoník, CSc; and Zuzana Olekszyová, MD
ABSTRACT
The aim of the current study was to compare the effectiveness of two types of cognitive training in 
60 older adults with mild cognitive impairment by assessing the impact on functional activities, qual­
ity of life (QOL), and various cognitive functions. The primary outcomes were functional activity level 
and QOL. The secondary outcome was cognitive examination. Group assignment was random. Group A 
(n = 30) underwent CogniPlus, a computer-based, cognitive training. Group B (n = 30) underwent clas­
sical group-based cognitive training. Both programs comprised two 30-minute sessions per week for 
10 weeks. After training, group A had better QOL (p < 0.001, effect size [ES] = 0.69) and better attention 
(increased load score, p < 0.05, ES = –0.23; errors, p < 0.001, ES = –0.47); however, there were no group 
differences in functional activity level. Group A demonstrated larger improvements in QOL and atten­
tion than group B (i.e., classical cognitive training), but the transfer to functional activities was the same 
between groups.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes a mild de­
cline in one or more cognitive domains and is often associ­
ated with age. Cognition is considered to be worse than 
expected for age; however, basic activities of daily living 
(ADLs) remain unaffected (Albert et al., 2011). Prevalence 
estimates of MCI range from 16% to 20% for the majority 
of reviewed studies (Roberts & Knopman, 2013).
Individuals with MCI often have difficulty remember­
ing new information and maintaining their attention, or 
they may take longer than their healthy counterparts to 
perform more cognitively demanding, goal-directed ac­
tivities, such as calculations, operating a mobile phone, 
buying a train ticket, or completing documents (Aretouli 
& Brandt, 2010). In 2011, the United Kingdom’s National 
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE; NICE 
& Social Care Institute for Excellence [SCIE], 2011) rec­
ommended the use of various types of cognitive training to 
stimulate cognition in older adults with MCI. 
In recent years, there has been growing interest in 
cognitive training for older adults, resulting in an in­

Cognitive Training Programs for Mild Cognitive Impairment
crease in knowledge about the efficacy of the various 
forms of cognitive training, cognitive stimulation, and 
cognitive rehabilitation (Kueider, Parisi, Gross, & Re­
bok, 2012). These programs are intended to improve 
cognition as well as everyday functioning and quality of 
life (QOL). Studies of cognitive training programs sug­
gest that although performance on the trained tasks im­
proves, there is minimal transfer of gains to functional 
activities in older adults (Bheher, 2015). A meta-analysis 
concluded that individuals who underwent MCI cogni­
tive training interventions had moderate improvements 
in functional abilities and small improvements in QOL 
and ADLs (Li et al., 2011).
Cognitive video games may also increase older adults’ 
ability to learn new tasks and adapt to new situations; how­
ever, there is no clear evidence that such improvements 
are reflected in improvements in ADLs and QOL (Bahar-
Fuchs, Clare, & Woods, 2013). A study by Vidovich et al. 
(2015) found that a group-based program of cognitive ac­
tivity produced minimal improvements in attention and 
QOL. Thus, there is an urgent need to establish whether 
the various novel cognitive training programs and dual-
task exercises designed for older adults with MCI are ef­
fective not only in improving cognitive functioning, but 
also the ability to perform functional activities and QOL 
(Vidovich et al., 2015). 
The current study investigated the effectiveness of two 
types of cognitive training. The CogniPlus is a computer-
based individual training program that is based on up-to-
date, scientific knowledge about cognitive functions and 
the ways in which they can be trained (Schuhfried GmbH, 
2014). Standard group-based cognitive training interven­
tions are delivered in group contexts and their objective is 
to improve, maintain, or restore mental functions through 
repeated and structured practice of tasks (Walsh, 2005). 
The main differences between these two types of training 
are that CogniPlus is a computer-based program. The pro­
gram also allows physical exercises to be combined with 
cognitive exercises and this dual-task condition places a 
heavier demand on attention. The classical group-based 
cognitive program offers more opportunities for interac­
tion, is delivered in a more playful style, and demands less 
attention. Despite these differences, both programs were 
designed to produce improvements in cognitive function­
ing that would transfer to functional activities.
The purpose of the current study was to compare two 
types of cognitive training programs—the CogniPlus (i.e., 
a computer-based, individual program) and a classical, 
group-based program—in older adults with MCI to deter­
mine which produced the best transfer of gains to func­
tional activities and QOL and the biggest improvements in 
cognitive functions.
METHOD
The sample comprised individuals with confirmed MCI 
(based on standard clinical examinations administered by 
a neurologist, psychiatrist, and clinical psychologist) as de­
fined by Albert’s criteria (Albert et al., 2011). The study was 
performed in outpatient psychiatric clinics to which older 
patients from all over eastern Slovakia are referred for di­
agnosis and treatment. 
Between June 2013 and March 2014, of 160 patients 
with a diagnosis of MCI in the outpatient psychiatric 
clinics’ database, 80 were randomly selected by means of 
a computer program (allocation ratio 1:1) and received a 
telephone invitation to participate in the study. 
Inclusion criteria were reaffirmation of MCI diagno­
sis by a neurologist, psychiatrist, and psychologist using 
standard clinical examination and a neuropsychological 
testing battery, and age >65 years. The neuropsychological 
test battery from the Psychiatric Center of Prague (Preiss 
et al., 2012) was used. Neuropsychological assessment was 
performed to assess working memory, attention, executive 
functions, verbal fluency, depression, and intelligence. The 
tests were administered by a clinical psychologist (O.D.). 
Exclusion criteria were moderate or severe cognitive 
deficits (defined as Mini-Mental State Examination score 
≤21) and dementia, severe depressive and/or anxiety disor­
ders, and psychiatric disorders, all confirmed by neurolog­
ical, psychiatric, and clinical psychological examination. 
Further exclusion criteria were other neurological disor­
ders that might impact cognition, confirmed by neurologi­
cal examination. Physiotherapeutic examination excluded 
severe orthopedic disorders.
Twenty of 80 participants were excluded. After receiv­
ing detailed information about the training program, five 
individuals refused to take part in the study for various 
personal and organizational reasons, two were excluded 
due to severe orthopedic disorder, five for symptoms of 
severe depressive and anxiety disorders, and eight because 
of dementia and failure to complete the initial tests. 
Sixty participants were enrolled in the study by a mem­
ber of the research team who was not involved in the as­
sessments or interventions. The project data analyst gener­
ated a random sequence of numbers to arbitrarily classify 
an equal number of participants into groups A and B by 
means of a computer program. These numbers were placed 
in an envelope, which was subsequently sealed. The project

manager (Z.O.) opened the envelope and informed partici­
pants of their group assignment. 
Data were collected in the outpatient psychiatric clin­
ics at two time points. Baseline data were collected before 
training started and post-training data were collected after 
10 weeks of training. Individuals who participated in data 
collection did not participate in the implementation of 
the training programs. Participants were informed by the 
training staff that there were two types of training, but they 
were not told what intervention they would receive or the 
anticipated outcomes. The training staff were not blinded. 
All participants in group A completed all 20 training 
sessions. Two participants in group B failed to complete 
all 20 training sessions due to family problems; they left 
2 weeks before completing the training program. Miss­
ing values were included in analyses using the principle 
intention-to-treat, where the last value is carried forward. 
Participants were given information about the study proto­
col individually, after which they provided informed con­
sent for participation. The study was approved by the local 
ethics committee.
Interventions
Both cognitive training interventions were delivered in 
a psychiatric outpatient clinic by a team comprising a psy­
chiatrist, clinical psychologist, and professionally trained 
physiotherapist. 
Group A used the CogniPlus program. The sub-
programs used were designed specifically for individuals 
with MCI. The training programs are listed with recom­
mendation strength A in the Society for Neuropsychol­
ogy’s (2009) guidelines (Miller, 2009).
The sub-programs that involved activities that are 
similar to everyday activities were selected, targeting at­
tention, working memory, long-term memory, planning 
of everyday activities, and visual-motor abilities. The five 
CogniPlus sub-programs used were: 
l	 Alert (two forms): targets attention. Involves driving a 
virtual car and stopping as quickly as possible in front of 
an obstacle (18 levels of difficulty). 
l	 Nback: targets working memory. Participants were shown 
various pictures and had to remember two to three pic­
tures previously presented (15 levels of difficulty).
l	 Names: targets long-term memory. Trains participants 
to use effective strategies for recalling the names and 
surnames of individuals based on their faces (17 levels 
of difficulty). 
l	 Pland (three forms—A, B, C): targets executive func­
tions and planning of daily activities. Training consists 
of solving tasks under time constraints and with some 
temporal overlap between tasks (16 levels of difficulty). 
l	 Vismo: targets visual-motor abilities. Training involves 
trying to keep a spaceship displayed on the computer 
screen inside a circle (22 levels of difficulty).
Training is designed to be progressive. At the start of the 
program, participants tackled the lowest level of difficulty; 
the level of difficulty was automatically adjusted thereafter 
according to individual performance. The objective was to 
attain the highest level of difficulty on all programs.
Participants quickly attained the highest level of diffi­
culty on the Alert, Names, and Pland A, B sub-tasks and 
so these were combined with physical exercises to create 
dual-task conditions. These conditions were not possible 
for Nback, Vismo, and Pland C, as participants’ full atten­
tion was required for these tasks. 
The dual-task conditions were as follows:
l	 Alert + exercise (targets attention). Involves driving a 
virtual car and stopping as quickly as possible in front 
of the obstacle, while stepping from one foot to the other 
and raising the heels while standing on both feet. 
l	 Names + exercise (targets long-term memory). Involves 
memorizing names and faces while changing from a 
standing position to a one-legged kneeling position and 
back again. 
l	 Pland A + exercise and Pland B + exercise (targets ex­
ecutive functions). Training involved planning everyday 
activities and solving tasks within a time limit while tak­
ing one step backward and then one step forward.
The training sessions were supervised by a profession­
ally trained clinical psychologist and physiotherapist. The 
CogniPlus program provides feedback on the level of dif­
ficulty the participant has mastered in each task, reaction 
times, and percentages of correct and incorrect responses. 
All training sessions lasted 30 minutes; each sub-program 
lasted 10 minutes and thus all functions were covered in 
every week of training. Each participant attended two 
training sessions per week for 10 weeks, with 20 sessions 
in total. 
Group B received the classical group cognitive train­
ing program for older adults with MCI (Walsh, 2005). The 
group was divided into three groups of 10 participants. 
Training was delivered in two 30-minute training sessions 
per week for 10 weeks. The training sessions were guided 
by a trained psychologist. The training comprised exercises 
targeting the following functions: 
l	 Verbal fluency. Participants read lists of 20 words (with 
animals, names, objects) written on paper and then had 
to recall as many as possible for 1 minute.

Cognitive Training Programs for Mild Cognitive Impairment
l	 Memory. Participants attempted to memorize various 
short verses; the aim was to remember at least several 
phrases. 
l	 Psychomotor learning. Participants assembled puzzles 
to improve their fine psychomotor skills; the aim was to 
complete various pictures.
l	 Communication and reasoning. The groups held free 
discussions on various topics (e.g., family, international 
and domestic policy, the weather) to encourage partici­
pants to express their views and practice their commu­
nication skills (Walsh, 2005). 
This program did not involve progressive increases in 
the level of difficulty of the tasks. Performance on the tasks 
was evaluated subjectively by a therapist. Participants were 
given information about the program, its aims, and tasks 
by a trained therapist. 
The main differences between the two types of training 
were as follows:
l	 CogniPlus (group A) was computer-based and delivered 
individually, whereas the classical cognitive training 
(group B) was delivered in a group format, in a more 
playful style, and offered more opportunities for interac­
tion.
l	 CogniPlus included dual-task conditions created by 
adding physical tasks to the cognitive tasks.
l	 Feedback in CogniPlus was provided by computer, 
whereas in the classical program the only feedback was 
subjective feedback from the researchers involved in de­
livering the program.
l	 CogniPlus placed heavier demands on attention.
At the end of formal training, participants were in­
structed to continue performing similar cognitive activi­
ties as part of their everyday activities. 
Outcome Variables
Variables were assessed at baseline and after 10 weeks 
of training in all participants. The duration of the training 
programs was set at 10 weeks because the recommended 
duration for this type of training is 2 to 3 months (NICE & 
SCIE, 2011); this timeframe was also believed to be conve­
nient for participants. 
The variables selected were designed to provide as­
sessments of cognitive and psychomotor abilities and 
functional activity and QOL. The methods to assess 
cognitive and psychomotor abilities were selected be­
cause they are frequently used in cognitive psychol­
ogy and recommended by NICE (NICE & SCIE, 2011). 
The timing of assessments was similar to that in other 
studies (Halvarsson et al., 2011; Hiyamizu, Morioka, 
Shomoto, & Shimada, 2011; Niu, Tan, Guan, Zhang, & 
Wang, 2010).
Primary Outcome Variables. The Functional Activities 
Questionnaire (FAQ) is a 10-item self-reported question­
naire used to evaluate functional activities. It assesses an 
individual’s ability to perform the following activities: com­
pleting forms, shopping, playing complex social games, 
preparing meals, following and understanding events, re­
membering important dates, and orienting oneself to the 
surrounding environment. Low scores indicate better func­
tioning. The questionnaire is suitable for use in older adults 
with MCI; it is valid, reliable, and responsive to changes over 
time (Bartoš, Martínek, Bezdícek, Bucek, & Rípová, 2008; 
Pfeffer, Kurosaki, Harrah, Chance, & Filos, 1982). 
Spitzer et al.’s (1981) QOL index is a 5-item, self-reported 
index, which assesses an individual’s self-sufficiency with 
respect to daily activities as well as well-being, satisfaction, 
mood, and provision of support by family or the commu­
nity. The index comprises five questions with a maximum 
score of 10. Higher scores indicate better QOL (Spitzer et 
al., 1981). This validated and reliable index was chosen 
because of its simplicity, clarity, and comprehensiveness 
(Erridge et al., 2005; Greimel, Thiel, Peintinger, Cegnar, & 
Pongratz, 2002). 
Secondary Outcome Variables. Addenbrooke’s Cogni­
tive Examination (ACE) is a widely used neuropsycho­
logical test that provides a detailed cognitive profile of 
the individual and is used for early detection of cogni­
tive disorders. The ACE comprises five subscales dealing 
with different cognitive domains: attention and concen­
tration (18 points), memory (26 points), verbal fluency 
(14 points), language (26 points), and visuospatial ability 
(16 points). Subscale scores are summed to provide a total 
score (maximum = 100). Scores between 89 and 100 are 
considered normal, scores from 83 to 88 indicate mild de­
mentia, and scores <83 indicate severe dementia (Bartoš, 
Raisová, & Kopecek, 2011; Mathuranath, Nestor, Berrios, 
Rakowicz, & Hodges, 2000). 
The Stroop Test is frequently used to assess atten­
tion. The test is presented in the form of three lists: 
(a) 100 words printed in black, (b) 100 colored rectangles, 
and (c) 100 words printed in various colors. Response 
latencies and errors in naming the colors and words are 
calculated; shorter response latencies and fewer errors in­
dicate better performance. The Words category (partici­
pant reads words printed in black as quickly as possible) 
assesses personal speed. The Colors category (participant 
names the color of rectangles as quickly as possible) as­
sesses perception. The Words-Colors category (participant 

176

must state the color in which a word is printed as quickly 
as possible) assesses perception load score. The Words–
Colors–Words (participant names the color in which a 
word is printed and reads the word as quickly as possible) 
assesses increased load score. When print color and word 
are congruent (e.g., red printed in red) the task is easy, 
but when the print color and word are incongruent (blue 
printed in red), participants experience interference and 
the task is more difficult (Daniel, 1983; Stroop, 1935).
Descriptive Instruments
The following instruments were used to indicate inclu­
sive and exclusive criteria of potential participants. The 
MMSE is a valid and reliable 30-point questionnaire that is 
used in clinical and research settings to assess basic cogni­
tive functions (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975). The 
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) evaluates symptoms 
of depression, with higher scores indicating more serious 
depression; the maximum score is 63 points (Beck, Steer, 
Ball, & Ranieri, 1996).
Statistical Analysis
The primary analysis was intention-to-treat and in­
volved all participants. Descriptive and inferential statis­
tics were used to analyze the data. Independent t tests for 
continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical 
variables were used to compare the groups at baseline. 
Shapiro-Wilk and D’Agostino-Pearson tests were used to 
confirm that the data were normally distributed. The dif­
ferences between group A and group B at the time before 
(i.e., Time 1, baseline) and 10 weeks after the intervention 
(i.e., Time 2, follow up) were evaluated using general linear 
model (GLM)–repeated measures (mixed design analysis 
of variance, split–plot) with Greenhouse-Geisser correc­
tion. Effect sizes (r) were based on Cohen’s d using means 
and standard deviations. Missing values at follow up 
(n = 2) were imputed by the last observation. Calculations 
were performed using SPSS 22 for Windows. The level of 
statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
A priori power analysis with t test for the difference be­
tween two independent means (two groups), with α = 0.05, 
β = 0.2, and effect size = 0.65, showed that the sample of 
30 participants in each group was sufficient, with an actual 
power of 0.80.
RESULTS
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
The demographic profile of the sample is summarized 
in Table 1. The sample comprised individuals with MCI 
ages 65 to 75. Groups A and B were similar with respect 
to age, education, and duration of MCI. BDI-II scores in­
dicated mild depression and MMSE scores indicated mild 
cognitive deficit. 
Post-Training Means and Group Comparisons
Table 2 presents the pre- and post-training results 
among the sample. There were no baseline differences 
between groups, and no differences in functional ac­
tivities were found after training. QOL was better in 
group A (p < 0.001) after training. The effect size was me­
dium (r = 0.69). 
After training, group A had higher total ACE scores 
(p < 0.001), with a small effect size (r = 0.31). Group A 
also had a better score on the language subscale (i.e., items 
relating to comprehension, writing, naming of objects, 
reading) (p < 0.01), with a medium effect size (r = 0.76). 
There were no group differences on the other subscales 
(i.e., memory, attention and concentration, verbal fluency, 
visuospatial abilities). 
After training, group A performed better on the Stroop 
attention tasks: increased load score was higher (p < 0.05) 
and participants made fewer mistakes (p < 0.001). Effect 
sizes were small (load score, r = –0.23; errors, r = –0.47). 
There were no group differences for the other attentional 
variables (e.g., personal speed, perception factor, percep­
tion load score). 
DISCUSSION
The current study compared two cognitive training 
programs designed for older adults with MCI. The aim 
was to determine the degree to which skills learned dur­
ing training transferred to functional activities and im­
proved QOL. The main finding was that the CogniPlus 
program produced a larger improvement in QOL and 
overall cognitive functioning (as measured by total 
ACE score) and attentional functioning (increased load 
scores and fewer errors on a Stroop task) than classi­
cal group-based cognitive training. This finding may be 
because the CogniPlus program is more complex and 
makes heavier demands on attention, as well as offers 
the opportunity to create dual tasks by combining tasks 
with physical exercises. 
There were no post-training group differences in 
functional activities, which might be due to the assess­
ment method used. One review (Bheher, 2015) conclud­
ed that there was limited transfer effect from cognitive 
training to functional activities, and the current study 
corroborates this finding.

Group A reacted positively to computerized perfor­
mance feedback, which was presented in a graphic format 
and explained to participants by the therapist. This positive 
reaction may have contributed to an improvement in well-
being and higher QOL reported for group A. Participants 
in group B tended to compare themselves to other mem­
bers of their training group, which was not always encour­
aging and may have had a negative impact on well-being.

mermann et al. (2014) 
suggested that this result 
might have been due to 
the motion element in 
the sports game training. 
The current researchers 
assumed that the mo­
tion elements performed 
as dual tasks could have 
a significant impact on 
improving 
attention. 
Therefore, motion ele­
ments were incorporated 
into physical exercises to 
create dual-task condi­
tions in the easily man­
ageable 
subprograms 
from CogniPlus tasks. 
The results showed that 
this 
made 
CogniPlus 
more effective as a tool 
for 
improving 
atten­
tional functioning and 
QOL. Zimmermann et 
al. (2014) did not evalu­
ate transfer of training 
effects to QOL. 
Vidovich et al. (2015) 
examined group cognitive 
activity and nonspecific 
educational programs in 
160 older adults with MCI 
with a 2-year rate of cog­
nitive decline. Interven­
tions lasted 5 weeks. They 
found only small benefi­
cial effects on attentional 
functioning and QOL. 
Although 
the 
current 
study’s assessment sched­
ule was 10 weeks, the 
group B findings are con­
sistent with Vidovich et 
al.’s (2015) results.

Cognitive Training Programs for Mild Cognitive Impairment
STRENGTHS, LIMITATIONS, AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS
The strengths of the current 
study include a relatively high 
response rate (85%) and low drop 
out rate. The main limitations of 
the study were the small sample and 
participants were only monitored for 
a short period of time. The longer-
term impact of interventions on 
variables was not examined. In addi­
tion, a control (i.e., no intervention) 
group was not included; therefore, 
the general effect of training could 
not be determined. Future studies 
with longer-term follow up are nec­
essary. It would be appropriate to 
determine which aspects of QOL 
were most affected by the comple­
tion of cognitive training using other 
validated questionnaires.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
Based on the current results, the 
design of cognitive training programs 
should be improved and other dual-
task training needs to be developed. 
Nurses can contribute to the develop­
ment and activation of new programs 
with dual tasks for older adults with 
cognitive deficits, as well as long-term 
monitoring of the transfer of interven­
tions to concrete domains of QOL of 
older adults. 
CONCLUSION
CogniPlus 
combined 
with 
motion elements produced greater 
improvements in QOL, overall cog­
nition as assessed by total ACE 
score, and attentional functioning 
(higher load scores and fewer errors 
on a Stroop task) than a classical 
group-based cognitive training pro­
gram. However, the transfer to func­
tional activities was no better than 
the group-based classical cognitive 
training program.
