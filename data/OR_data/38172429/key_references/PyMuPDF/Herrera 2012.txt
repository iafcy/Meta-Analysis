Considering the high risk for individuals with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (A-MCI) to progress
towards Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we investigated the efﬁcacy of a non-pharmacological intervention,
that is, cognitive training that could reduce cognitive difﬁculties and delay the cognitive decline. For
this, we evaluated the efﬁcacy of a 12-week computer-based memory-attention training program based
on recognition in subjects with A-MCI and compared their performances with those of A-MCI controls
trained in cognitively stimulating activities. The effect of training was assessed by comparing outcome
measures in pre- and post-tests 15 days before and after training. To evaluate the duration of training
beneﬁts, a follow-up test session was performed 6 months after memory and attention training or
cognitively stimulating activities.
Outcome measures showed that the trained group, compared to control group, improved episodic
recall and recognition. Six months after training, scores remained at the level of the post-test.
Since the training program was exclusively based on recognition, our results showed a general-
ization from recognition to recall processes, which are memory components that represent part of the
core cognitive impairments in individuals at risk of converting to AD. Thus, cognitive training based
on recognition holds promise as a preventive therapeutic method and could be proposed as a non-
pharmacological early-intervention strategy. Future investigations need to focus on methodological
constraints and delineating possible neuroplastic mechanisms of action.

1. Introduction
Cognitive enrichment early in life, as indicated by level of
education, complexity of work environment, and nature of leisure
activities, can promote better cognitive functioning that can be
maintained into advanced age (Acevedo & Loewenstein, 2007;
Brehmer et al., 2008). To combat age-related cognitive decline
and prevent dementia, interventions based on increasing complex
mental activity seem promising. Valenzuela and Sachdev (2006a,
2006b) reported that individuals with higher levels of mental
activity have a reduced rate of incident cognitive decline and are
at only about half the risk of developing dementia. These effects
reﬂect increased cognitive functioning, which depends on the
ability of the brain to compensate for pathological changes
associated with aging. This compensatory ability is referred to as
cognitive reserve. The cognitive reserve hypothesis suggests that
cognitive enrichment promotes utilization of available functions
(Christensen et al., 2008; Stern, 2009). The brain is malleable in
response to one’s environment, and the central nervous system is
continuously adjusting to environmental experiences. Beneﬁcial
effects of environmental enrichment early in life have been
observed in rodents and primates as structural correlates, which
include more synapses in speciﬁc brain regions that lead to greater
neuronal organization (for a review see Milgram, Siwak-Tapp,
Araujo, & Head, 2006).
Research on interventions based on augmenting complex mental
activity postulates that cognitive training (CT) acts by stimulating
neuroprotective mechanisms (Valenzuela & Sachdev, 2009), anchor-
ing the theoretical foundation of CT in the concept of synaptic
plasticity and cognitive reserve. Our previous works on rodents
support this view. During entry to senescence (around 15 months
old) or after cholinergic damage, rodents show a wide range
of cognitive deﬁcits (McGaughy, Everitt, Robbins, & Sarter, 2000).
We showed that housing in a long-term enriched environment
had beneﬁcial effects on cognitive performance (Paban, Jaffard,
Chambon, Malafosse, & Alescio-Lautier, 2005) and that this corre-
lated with an upregulated gene expression of neurotrophic signaling

molecules in frontal cortex and hippocampus (Paban, Chambon,
Manrique, Touzet, & Alescio-Lautier, 2011). Lambert, Fernandez, and
Frick (2005) found that cognitive stimulation in mice increased
synaptophysin levels in the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebel-
lum. Electrophysiological measures of synaptic plasticity such as
long-term potentiation are also increased (Artola et al., 2006).
Interestingly, enrichment in transgenic Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
mice has been associated with as much as 50% less amyloid
pathology (Adlard, Perreau, Pop, & Cotman, 2005; Costa et al.,
2007). Studies in humans showed that CT in healthy older indivi-
duals can increase levels of putatively neuroprotective metabolites
in the hippocampus (Valenzuela et al., 2003) and increase frontal
lobe metabolism (Small et al., 2006). It is unknown whether mental
training can delay hippocampal atrophy in AD, but Valenzuela,
Sachdev, Wen, Chen, and Brodaty (2008) reported that lifetime
levels of mental activity are inversely correlated to the rate of
hippocampal atrophy in healthy older adults. Thus, there is increas-
ing evidence in humans and animals of the role of environmental
and lifestyle factors as moderators in cognitive aging and as
protective agents for the development of AD. Given the involvement
of such factors in the outcome of aging, it is reasonable to assume
that cognitive intervention and particularly CT may play a role in
normal aging and AD.
Persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) retain a large
range of cognitive capacities and plasticity (Calero & Navarro,
2004), which makes them ideal for studying CT and its underlying
mechanisms. Moreover, CT might serve in persons with MCI who
are at risk of developing AD or other types of dementia.
To date, however, few studies have been conducted on CT and
MCI. Memory strategies training resulted in limited improvement
on objective memory and cognitive function (Rapp, Brenes, &
Marsh, 2002; Troyer, Murphy, Anderson, Moscovitch, & Craik,
2008), suggesting that impaired memory function may be resistant
to the beneﬁts of a unimodal memory intervention. In contrast,
multidomain CT in MCI showed positive effects on cognitive
abilities and on mood and behavioral disturbances (Barnes et al.,
2009; Cipriani, Bianchetti, & Trabucchi, 2006; Galante, Venturini,
& Fiaccadori, 2007; Gunter, Schafer, Holzner, & Kemmler, 2003;
Rozzini et al., 2007; Talassi, Guerreschi, Feriani, & Fedi, 2007).
Traditional pen-and-pencil CT exercises are progressively being
replaced by computer-based programs, which are superior in many
ways. The computer facilitates multimodal and multidomain
training, which seems to be a key factor for functional efﬁcacy,
and provides for individualized intervention, by gradually increas-
ing task difﬁculty in a customized fashion. These features allow
effective control of ceiling and ﬂoor effects, both important for
successful cognitive exercise because individuals are continually
cognitively challenged.
The speciﬁc goal of the present study was to develop, for subjects
with MCI, a computer-CT program based on memory functions
known to be deﬁcient with the advance of AD but still preserved
or slightly impaired in MCI, and then to conduct a pilot study to
evaluate this program on episodic recognition and retrieval pro-
cesses. The underlying hypothesis was that regular practice with
speciﬁc tasks would strengthen the functioning of the targeted
cognitive mechanisms, which are still relatively preserved, but
vulnerable to AD. For this, we focused on median temporal lobe
areas, which are vulnerable to early-stage AD (Braak & Braak, 1991;
Delacourte et al., 1999) and developed training exercises to stimu-
late these areas. Based on the reported neuroprotective effects of CT
(Valenzuela et al., 2003) and on the demonstration that neuroplas-
ticity exists in persons with MCI (Calero & Navarro, 2004), we
postulated that the stimulation of the brain regions vulnerable to
early-stage AD could generate neuroprotective effects by stimulating
residual neuroplastic pathways, reduce cognitive difﬁculties, and
delay the cognitive decline.

Materials and methods
2.1.
Patients
Twenty-two subjects with amnestic MCI multiple domains subtype (A-MCImd)
referring to the Behavioral Neurology Department of Sainte-Marguerite Hospital,
(Marseille, France) were selected. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) 65–90 years of
age and (ii) meet deﬁnition criteria for A-MCI-md (Petersen, 2004). All patients had
memory complaint, usually veriﬁed by an informant. Memory performances and
those in one or more other cognitive domains (i.e. attention or executive domain)
were below the normative data (see subsequent section for the description of
neuropsychological tests). The cut-off scores for abnormality were 1.5 SD below the
mean score for the corresponding age and education group, (iii) have normal general
cognitive functioning as determined by a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
(Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) scoreZ24, and (iv) a global clinical dementia
rating scale (Hugues, Berg, Danzinger, Coben, & Martin, 1982) score of 0.5. Exclusion
criteria were (i) neurological, psychiatric, or medical disorders, (ii) moderate or severe
depression as determined by a score411 (moderate depression) or419 (severe
depression) on the Geriatric Depression Scale (Yesavage et al., 1983), (iii) relevant
hearing, vision, motor or language deﬁcits, and (iv) recent participation in cognitive
stimulation/training.
All patients underwent a CT scan and routine biological screening. Activities
of daily living were normal, as assessed through the Instrumental Activities of
Daily Living (IADL, Barberger-Gateau et al., 1992). All patients underwent standard
neuropsychological assessment. The neuropsychological battery assessed memory,
attention, and executive skills. It included the following tests: The Rey Auditory
Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT, Spreen & Strauss, 1998), the 16-item free and cued
reminding test (RL/RI-16 test, Van der Linden et al., 2004), the copy and recall of the
Rey Figure (Rey, 1959), the MMSE, the forward and backward digit span, the Trail
Making Test (TMT, Reitan, 1958), Zazzo’s cancellation test (Zazzo, 1974), Stroop test
(Golden, 1978), the semantic (animals) and phonemic (letter P) verbal ﬂuency test
(Cardebat et al., 1990), the dual-task test of Baddeley (Baddeley et al., 1997), and
the DO-80 naming test (Deloche et al., 1997). Behavioral assessment included the
30-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS, Yesavage et al., 1983).
The 22 patients were randomly assigned into two groups (11 patients per
group): a group that performed training (Trained group) and a group that
participated in stimulating cognitive activities (Control group). Baseline demo-
graphic data are summarized in Table 1.
This study was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki and the
study was approved by the hospital research Ethics Committee. All patients
provided written informed consent prior to participation.

Intervention
2.2.1.
Memory and attention training
2.2.1.1. Theoretical foundations. Because MCI individuals have mainly episodic mem-
ory deﬁcits and their recognition memory mechanisms are at least relatively intact,
our CT program used a familiarity-based forced-choice recognition procedure. Neu-
ropsychological studies on A-MCI patients reported prominent deﬁcits in episodic
memory, characterized by impaired encoding and storage capacities in recall (for
review, see Belleville, Sylvain-Roy, de Boysson, & Me´nard, 2008), a pattern that is also
characteristic in AD (for a review, see Lekeu & Van der Linden, 2005). These memory
impairments are also reported for recognition (Alescio-Lautier et al., 2007; Dudas,
Clague, Thompson, Graham, & Hodges, 2005; Perri, Carlesimo, Serra, Caltagirone, and
the Early Diagnosis Group of the Italian Interdisciplinary Network on Alzheimer’s
Disease 2005), which involves recollection and familiarity processes. Other A-MCI
studies revealed a signiﬁcant deﬁcit in recollection-based recognition but a selective
preservation of familiarity-based recognition (Anderson et al., 2008; Serra et al., 2010;
Westerberg, Paller, Mayes, Holdstock, & Reber, 2006).
Short-term memory is impaired in AD. In A-MCI-md, this deﬁcit appears as
increasing time between the encoding and recognition phase (Gagnon & Belleville,
2011), reﬂecting a difﬁculty in maintaining information, which consequently affects
working memory. Subjects with A-MCI-md have preserved immediate memory and
memory for short delays. To improve information maintenance during working

memory, training was based on increasing the maintenance time. For this, we gradually
increased the blank interval between memorization and recognition. This technique is
used in the spaced retrieval method (Laudauer & Bjork, 1978), which is efﬁcient for
patients with mild AD (Camp & Stevens, 1990; Erkes, Raffard, & Meulemans, 2010).
Because short- and long-term memory processes share similar neural mechanisms
(Marklund et al., 2007; Nee & Jonides, 2011), we hypothesized that short-term memory
training would help maintain information in long-term memory.
Based on the notion that remediation is better if participants are prevented from
reinforcing their own errors, we endorse the deﬁnition of ‘‘error reduction’’ proposed
by Fillingham, Hodgson, Sage, and Lambon-Ralph (2003). In this context, before and
during training exercise, we used a procedure that reduces errors. Prior to training, the
subjects were invited to perform a guided procedure that forced them to provide a
good answer. This guided procedure was repeated until the subjects had acquired the
automatisms to properly perform the task. Then, during training we used an approach
whereby the task was manipulated to reduce incorrect responses. Subjects began with
very easy discrimination, and task difﬁculty was increased gradually by the neurop-
sychologist (for more details see procedure section below).
We also focused on the practical implementation of mnemonic strategies, for
example naming, repetition, categorization, or association. Indeed, MCI individuals
may beneﬁt from intervention programs to optimize their functioning through the
use of cognitive and memory strategies (Belleville, 2008; Belleville et al., 2006).
The CT program incorporates, in addition to memory training, training of focused and
divided attention and processing speed. In fact, besides memory deﬁcits, A-MCI-md
patients exhibit attentional deﬁcits, particularly in attentional focus (Levinoff, Saumier,
& Chertkow, 2005; Tales, Snowden, Haworth, & Wilcock, 2005), divided attention and
attentional control (Belleville, Chertkow, & Gauthier, 2007; Danhausser et al., 2005),
and/or speed of processing (Gorus, De Raedt, Lambert, Lemper, & Mets, 2008; Levinoff
et al., 2005). Memory and attention are highly interactive and interdependent
processes, due to their functional association and their shared circuitry. Attention is
composed of hierarchical sub-components. High in the attention taxonomy are
complex attention abilities such as working memory, divided attention, and the ability
to shift attention between different tasks (Sturm, Willmes, Orgass, & Hartje, 1997). To
enhance attention performances throughout training, we repeatedly administered
several attentional tasks in a hierarchy based on the model of Van Zomeren and
Brouwer (1994), which highlights areas of strength and selectivity of attention.
2.2.1.2. Training exercises. Training exercises were programmed in Java (Release 1.4)
and conducted on a Microsoft Windows-based computer with a 12-in. tactile screen
and a resolution of 1.024 768 pixels. The stimuli were pictures belonging to various
categories (e.g., animals, ﬂowers, objects of everyday life) and common words prono-
unced by the computer. Each picture was 256 256 pixels in size. Responses to trai-
ning tasks were given using a tactile screen, a standard keyboard (using only 2 keys),
and a computer mouse. For attentional training, we used response time tasks to yes/no
choice; for memory training, we used recognition memory tasks with forced choice.
Memory training task:
Visual recognition task (v-RM)—The task lasted ﬁve minutes. Participants started
the exercise with a number of pictures to memorize that was adjusted according
to their performance in a pre-training session. There were three variants. In
variant 1 (V1), participants were asked to memorize pictures and recognize them
immediately after their presentation among distractors. Participants had to
respond by clicking on the recognized pictures. Variant 2 (V2) was identical to
V1 but memorization and recognition were separated by a blank interval of 10,
20, or 30 s. Variant 3 (V3) was identical to V2 but a distractor (multiple-choice-
questionnaire based on semantic knowledge) was introduced during the interval
(10, 20, or 30 s). We determined the percentage of correct responses.
Visuospatial recognition task (vs-RM)—The task lasted ﬁve minutes. Partici-
pants started the exercise with a number of pictures to memorize that was
adjusted according to their performance in a pre-training session. There were
three variants. In variant 1(V1), participants had to memorize the position of
identical pictures and recognize this layout among two proposals: one was the
layout and the other not. Participants had to respond by clicking on the model.
Variant 2 (V2) was identical to V1 but memorization and recognition were
separated by a blank interval of 10, 20, or 30 s. Variant 3 was identical to V2
but the multiple-choice-questionnaire distractor was introduced during the
interval (10, 20, or 30 s). We determined the percentage of correct responses.
Visual recognition Working Memory Training Task (v-RWM)—This task lasted ﬁve
minutes. At the beginning of the task, participants had to memorize one
picture and, in the next trial, they were asked to memorize a novel picture and
then to click on the old picture. In the next trial, the new pictures became the
old pictures. This procedure was repeated throughout the task. We deter-
mined the percentage of correct responses.
Attentional training task:
Visual Focused Attention Task (v-FA)—The task lasted three minutes. There were
three variants. In variant 1 (V1), participants had to concentrate on the middle of
the screen to detect a target picture. Pictures (50% distractor, 50% target) appeared
one after the other in the middle of the screen. Participants had to press on a key:
‘‘enter’’ for yes, it is the target, and ‘‘esc’’ for no, it is not the target. Participants
were instructed to respond as fast and as accurately as possible. Variant 2 (V2) was
identical to V1 but pictures (50% distractor, 50% target) also appeared in the
periphery of the screen. Participants were instructed to ignore these pictures, even
if it was the target picture. Variant 3 (V3) was identical to V1 but the target was a
category, i.e. animals. We determined the percentage of correct responses and the
response time (s).
Visuospatial Focused Attention Task (vs-FA)—The task lasted three minutes. There
were three variants. In variant 1(V1), pictures (50% distractor, 50% target)
appeared one after the other on the left or the right of the screen. Participants
had to press a key: ‘‘enter’’ for yes, it is the target, and ‘‘esc’’ for no, it is not the
target. They were instructed to respond as fast and as accurately as possible. In
variant 2 (V2), two pictures appeared at the same time, one of which was
pointed to by an arrow. The participants had to respond if the picture pointed to
by the arrow was the target picture or not. They were instructed to ignore
pictures that were not pointed to by the arrow even if it was the target picture.
We determined the percentage of correct responses and the response time (s).
Divided attention task—The task was limited to six trials. Variant 1 (V1) consisted
in concurrently performing one auditory short-term memory task (words
pronounced by the computer) and V1 of the v-FA task. The recognition test took
place after the dual-task. The subject had to recognize pictures that corresponded
to the words heard among distractors. Variant 2 (V2) was identical to V1 but with
V2 of the v-FA task. Variant 3 (V3) was identical to V1 but with V3 of the v-FA
task. We determined the percentage of correct responses for the auditory short
term memory task and the percentage of correct responses and the response time
(s) for the visual focus attention task. Modulated parameters and cognitive
processes trained by each task are given in Table 2.
2.2.2.
Cognitive activities
Patients assigned to the control group were administered cognitive activities
consisting of exercises in which they were asked to ﬁnd names of countries and
corresponding capitals, organize a list of purchases in categories, ﬁnd similarities
and differences, choose a newspaper article and bar all the letters ‘‘A’’, read a text
and then answer questions, or tell a story or construct a sentence from a list of
words in disorder, etc. All control patients performed the same sets of activities
sessions. For training sessions, the control group was assigned the same number,
frequency, and duration of cognitive activities sessions as the trained group.
2.2.3.
Procedure
Training or cognitive activities sessions were supervised by a trained neurop-
sychologist who gave the instructions and managed the execution time for each
activity. Each session had the same structure including 1—a welcome and a
reminder of what had been done at the previous session, 2—training with two
cognitive exercises or two cognitively stimulating activities, 3—teaching of
memory strategies that can be applied in daily demanding memory situations
(e.g., store the objects in the same place, take notes, etc.), 4—information on the
cognitive functioning and on the effects of aging on cognitive functioning, and
5—a conclusion with feedback on performances or activities session.
Training consisted of 24 sessions of approximately 1 h that involved a memory
task and an attention task (detailed presentation in Table 3). Both memory and
attention tasks were performed using the following schedule: (a) read general
information: participants read information about trained memory or attention process,
e.g., deﬁnitions, examples in everyday life; (b) read the instructions for the task to
perform; (c) view an example of the task: subjects performed some trials in which no
mistake is possible, (d) practice the task: participants performed some trials of the task
and were informed when they made a mistake. This step is based on trial and error
learning technique, and (e) perform the task: participants performed the task and were
informed at the end about their performance. Training was individualized for each
patient by the neuropsychologist who had the opportunity to increase or decrease the
difﬁculty of each task by modulating parameters such as the duration of image
presentation, the number of pictures or words to remember, the choice of the target, or
the addition of a distractor. These parameters were adjusted by the neuropsychologist
at the phases ‘‘view an example of the task’’ and ‘‘practice the task’’. As patients
improved across sessions, these parameters were manipulated so that the tasks would
continue to challenge their abilities but without putting them in distress because they
failed. Because of the adjustment of the level of exigency and complexity of the training
according to the skills of the patients and their progress during training, the
performances were never inferior to 70% and the feedback was always positive.
2.3.
Outcome measures
Outcome measures included neuropsychological tests investigating verbal and
visual memory. Verbal memory was assessed by the forward and the backward digit-
span test, the 12-word-list recall test from the BEM-144 memory battery (Signoret,
1991), the 16-item free and cued reminding test (16-FR/CR test) (Van der Linden et al.,
2004), and the subscore recall of the MMSE. Visual memory was assessed by the visual
recognition subtest from the Doors and People memory battery (Baddeley, Emslie, &

Nimmo-Smith, 1994), the DMS48 test (Barbeau et al., 2004), which is a delayed
matching-to-sample task designed to assess visual recognition memory, and the recall
of the Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure (Rey, 1959).
2.4.
Experimental design
All participants attended 24 individual 60-min sessions of training, 2 times per
week for 12 weeks. The training and cognitive activities sessions took place in our
laboratory. The effect of training and cognitive activities was assessed by
comparing outcome measures in pre- and post-tests 15 days before (t0) and after
(t1) training. To evaluate the maintenance of training beneﬁts over time, a follow-
up test session (t2) was performed 6 months after training or cognitive activities.
Three trained neuropsychologists were involved in the study: one administered
and scored the pre-tests, post-tests, and follow-up tests (this person was kept
blind to the group membership of patients), one supervised training, and
one supervised cognitive activities. Parallel versions were used at post-test and
follow-up test for the 12-word-list recall test, the 16-item free and cued reminding
test, and the MMSE (the list of words differed and semantic categories changed).
2.5.
Statistical analysis
The STATISTICA 7.0 package (StatSoft, Inc.) and STATVIEW 5.0 package (SAS
Institute Inc.) were used for data analysis. Training data were analyzed by repeated
measures ANOVA for each variant that included Session as repeated factor.
Correlation analyses (Pearson correlations) were carried out to investigate the
relationship between the percentage of correct responses and the time interval in
attention tasks. To evaluate the effect of training, neuropsychological test mean
scores of the trained group were compared to those of control group at t0 (pre-test),
t1 (post-test), and t2 (6-months follow-up) through an ANOVA with repeated
measures that included Testing as repeated factor, followed by the post-hoc
Newman–Keuls t-test with the Bonferroni correction for the signiﬁcant effects.
For the three free recall sessions of the 16-item free and cued reminding test, we
performed repeated measures ANOVA for each test, i.e. t0, t1, and t2, including Free
Recall as repeated factor to compare performances between the two groups. Effect
sizes were calculated using Zp
2. Following Cohen (1988), Zp
2 above 0.01 reﬂects a
small effect, above 0.06 a medium effect, and above 0.14 a large effect.
3. Results
3.1. Performances of training sessions
We postulated that training must generate ongoing cognitive
dynamics that required continuous effort by the patient to be
effective. Thus, parameters were manipulated so that training
tasks would continue to challenge each patient’s abilities without

Modulated parameters and cognitive processes trained for each task. Two types of modulated parameters can be distinguished: those that were invariant and
distinguished the variants of a task, and those that varied between subjects for a variant. Thus, throughout training, parameters were adjusted to the cognitive level of the
patients. For memory exercises, the variation of (i) the number of pictures permitted us to act on memory load according to the attentional cost of the task, (ii) the number
of distractors played a key role in the resistance to interference, (iii) the duration of model presentation acted on the speed and the quality of information processing, and
(iv) the time interval promoted information maintenance. For attention exercises, the choice of the target pictures served to modulate the similarity between the target
and the distractors in order to favor information processes training tasks Modulated parameters Trained cognitive processes.

putting them in distress or causing them to fail. Examples of the
evolution of the parameters manipulated are illustrated in Fig. 1A.
The number of pictures to memorize during the training of the
visual recognition task increased for V1, V2, and V3 (Fig. 1A1) for
training performances (% of correct responses) between 85 % and
95% (data not shown). Similarly, the number of distractors in
the recognition test increased (Fig. 1A2) for V1, V2, and V3 for the
same range of performance. In the same way, the number of
words memorized during the training of auditory memory
increased in both the single (Fig. 1A3) and dual task situation
(Fig. 1A4) for training performances (% of correct responses)
respectively between 100% and 90–96% (data not shown). These
data show that patients with MCI are able to maintain a high level
of performance despite the increased mental load. Thus, partici-
pants improved their memory abilities during training.
Recall that to customize training, parameters were speciﬁcally
adjusted to the cognitive level of the patient. Consequently, the
evolution of training performances lies in a narrow range, and a
stabilized performance should be interpreted as an improvement
of the cognitive component trained since the complexity of
the training was gradually adjusted according to the skills of
the patients and their progress. An example is provided with the
training of focalized attention. Performances are illustrated in
Fig. 1B. In this task, we asked the subjects to respond as quickly as
possible: yes, it is the target, or no, it is not the target. Since the
subjects had to respond correctly and quickly, training consisted in
ﬁnding a compromise between response accuracy, indicated by the
percentage of correct responses (respectively for the visual and the
visuospatial focalized attention: Figs. 1B1 and 1B2), and the speed at
which the subject answered, indicated by the response times
(respectively for the visual and the visuospatial focalized attention:
Figs. 1B3 and 1B4). Repeated measures ANOVA on the percentage of
correct response for the visual focalized attention showed a sig-
niﬁcant effect of Session for V1 [F(2, 20)¼3.51, p¼0.05; Zp
2¼0.26]
but no effect for V2 and V3 (respectively, [F(1, 10)¼2.94, p¼0.117;
Zp
2¼0.22, F(2, 20)¼1.42, p¼0.265; Zp
2¼0.12]) (Fig. 2A). The post-hoc
Newman–Keuls t-test (po0.05) on V1 indicated that training perfor-
mances on session 5 differed from those on sessions 1 and 2. The
same analysis on the mean response times revealed a signiﬁcant
effect of Session for V1 and V2 (respectively, [F(2, 20)¼10.063,
p¼0.0001; Zp
2¼0.50], [F(1, 10)¼13.913, p¼0.003; Zp
2¼0.72]), but
no effect for V3 [F(2, 20)¼3.050, p¼0.069; Zp
2¼0.23] (Fig. 2C). The
post-hoc Newman–Keuls t-test (po0.05) for V1 indicated that
training performances on session 1 differed from those on sessions
2 and 5. Repeated measures ANOVA on the percentage of correct
response for the visuospatial focalized attention revealed no effect of
session for V1 [F(2, 20)¼0.30, p¼0.741; Zp
2¼0.03] but a signiﬁcant
effect for V2 [F(4, 40)¼5.99, p¼0.0001; Zp
2¼0.37] (Fig. 2B). The post-
hoc Newman–Keuls t-test (po0.05) indicated that training perfor-
mances on session 12 differed from those of the next sessions. The
same analysis on the mean response times showed no effect of
Session for V1 [F(2, 20)¼2.829, p¼0.082; Zp
2¼0.22] but a signiﬁcant
effect for V2 [F(4, 40)¼11.735, p¼0.0001; Zp
2¼0.54] (Fig. 2D). The
post-hoc Newman–Keuls t-test (po0.05) indicated that training
performances on sessions 17, 21, and 22 differed from those on
sessions 12 and 13.
Correlation analyses showed a signiﬁcant negative correlation
between the percentage of correct responses and response times
whatever the modality (visual vs. visuospatial) and the variant
considered, V1–V3 (r¼ 0.465, p¼0.005; r¼ 0.377, p¼0.029;
r¼ 0.423, p¼0.013 respectively from variants 1–3 of the visual
focused attention task and r¼ 0.470, p¼0.005; r¼ 0.759,
p¼0.0001 respectively for variants 1 and 2 of the visuospatial
focused
attention task). Thus,
as
the
percentage
of correct
responses increased, the response times decreased, suggesting
improved attentional focus and processing speed over training.
Participants improved in all training tasks except for the
visuospatial recognition memory task, which failed to train this
modality of memory. For this task, it seems that training was too
short to achieve positive results.
3.2. Performances on recognition and recall after training
Results are presented in Table 4. At pre-test (t0), the two groups
did not differ signiﬁcantly in memory neuropsychological test scores
(see Table 4, t0 column; Newman–Keuls t-test, po0.05).

Table 3
Organization of training. Training consisted of 24 training sessions. Memory and
attention processes were concurrently stimulated. Each session included an
attention task, either visual focused attention (v-FA), visuospatial focus attention
(vs-FA), or divided attention (DA), and a memory task, either visual recognition
memory (v-RM), visuospatial recognition memory (vs-RM), or visual recognition
working memory (v-RWM). Training of memory promoted stimulation of visual
and visuospatial modalities alternatively by using an adaptation of the spaced
retrieval method. During these exercises, patients were encouraged to use
mnemonic strategies like verbalization, association of ideas, and mental imagery.
Training of attention was based on a speciﬁc approach that considered the sub-
components of attention as being distinct, hierarchical, and independent. In this
context, the hierarchical order was based on the theoretical model of Van Zomeren
and Brouwer (1994), highlighting the intensity and selectivity axes of attention.
With regard to the selectivity axis, we articulated our training on selective
attention, divided attention, and working memory. For each hierarchical step of
the selectivity axis, hierarchical steps of the intensity axis were embedded, i.e.
alertness, vigilance, and sustained attention. Such hierarchies have been success-
fully used by Sturm et al. (1997) in the training of attention only. For the training
of memory and attention components, the levels of exigencies and complexity
were constantly adapted to the patients’ progress during training. The advantage
of using this procedure was suggested by Strache (1987) and was highlighted in
the work of Sturm et al. (1997).

trained group had better performances than the control group at
both t1 and t2 for set A and only at t1 for set B.
The recognition score of the DMS48 was also improved (group
effect [F(1, 20)¼3.035, p¼0.096; Zp
2¼0.13]; testing effect [F(2, 40)¼

2¼0.17]; group  testing interaction [F(2, 40)¼
3.858, p¼0.029]; Zp
2¼0.18). The trained group improved perfor-
mances at t1 (post-hoc Newman–Keuls t-test, po0.05). Note that at
6 months, differences did not reach signiﬁcance, due to greater
intra-group variability.
That the improvement persisted for set A at t2 suggests
training had a strong effect on recognition. However, this effect
needs to be consolidated concerning set B and DMS48.
3.2.2. Training effects on digit span
The forward digit span was improved in the trained group
compared to control group over the three test sessions (Repeated

The post-hoc Newman–Keuls t-test (po0.05) indicated that the
trained group improved their span at t1 and t2, showing that
training preserved performances 6 months later. No effect of
training was seen for the backward digit span.
3.2.3. Training effects on recall
The total score of the BEM-144 12-word-list recall test was
improved in the trained group (repeated measures ANOVA: group

2¼0.20]). The post-hoc Newman–Keuls t-test
(po0.05) showed that the trained group improved performances at
both t1 and t2, indicating training improved recall.
The total score of the 16-item free and cued reminding test was
higher in the trained group than the control group (repeated

The post-hoc Newman–Keuls t-test (po0.05) indicated that, com-
pared to the control group, the trained group improved its recall at
t1, but this was not signiﬁcant at t2. The score for the three free
recalls are presented in Fig. 2A. Repeated measures ANOVA on data
at t0 revealed that the two groups increased their score over the
three free recalls (free recall effect [F(2, 40)¼12.324, po0.0001;
Zp

than the control group (group effect [F(1, 20)¼5.191, p¼0.033;

(group free

[F(2,
40)¼0.136,
p¼0.873; Zp
2¼0.07]). Post-hoc analyses indicated that the increase
in free recall in the trained group started at the ﬁrst free recall and
was maintained throughout the two subsequent free recalls. At t2,
free recall was always higher in the trained group but the enhance-
ment did not reach statistical difference, due to increased variability
in the trained group relative to the control group. The scores for the
three cued free recall tests are presented in Fig. 2B. Data showed
that the number of cued recalled words was similar for the two
groups whatever the test (t0, t1, or t2), suggesting that training had
no effect on cueing. Regarding the delayed free recall (Fig. 2A) and
the cued delayed free recall (Fig. 2B) for t0, t1, and t2, we found, as
for free recall, that training improved delayed free recall but not
cueing (group effect [F(1, 20)¼7.478, p¼0.012; Zp
2¼0.27]; testing
effect [F(2, 40)¼0.853, p¼0.433; Zp
2¼0.04]; group testing inter-
action [F(2, 40)¼5.052, p¼0.011; Zp
2¼0.20] for the delayed free
recall and Group effect [F(1, 20)¼0.170, p¼0.685; Zp
2¼0.01]; testing
effect [F(2, 40)¼3.386, p¼0.105; Zp
2¼0.05]; group testing inter-
action [F(2, 40)¼1.07, p¼0.360; Zp
2¼0.02] for the cued delayed free
recall). The beneﬁcial effect of training seemed greater in delayed
free recall than in free recall, since performances were still enhanced
at t2 in delayed free recall (Fig. 2A) for the trained group, but not in
total free recall. Then, to assess whether there was any performance
gain between the last free recall and delayed free recall, a repeated
measures ANOVA was performed on the third free recall and the
delayed free recall for t1 and t2 (Fig. 2A). For t1, the analysis showed
recall was better maintained in the trained group than in the control
group (group effect [F(1, 20)¼26.406, po0.0001; Zp
2¼0.38]; free
recall effect [F(1, 20)¼0.363, p¼0.553; Zp
2¼0.02]; group  free recall
interaction [F(1, 20)¼5.806, p¼0.025; Zp
2¼0.19]). The post-hoc
Newman–Keuls t-test (po0.05) indicated that the control group
performed worse on delayed free recall than on the third free recall
whereas the trained group maintained its performance. For t2,
statistical analysis did not reach signiﬁcance, due to the increased
variability in the training group.
The recall of the three words of the MMSE (Table 4) was improved
in the trained group (group effect [F(1, 20)¼7.646, p¼0.012;
Zp
2¼0.28]; testing effect [F(2, 40)¼1.416, p¼0.254; Zp
2¼0.06]; group-
 testing interaction [F(2, 40)¼4.703, p¼0.014; Zp
2¼0.19]). The post-
hoc Newman–Keuls t-test (po0.05) showed that the trained group
performed better than the control group at both t1 and t2.
No effect was found for the recall of Rey–Osterrieth Complex
Figure, suggesting that our training did not have any effect on
visuoconstruction abilities.
4. Discussion
Our study revealed a positive effect of a computer-based
memory and attention training program in subjects with A-MCImd.
Interestingly, although only recognition was trained, both recogni-
tion and recall processes were improved, indicating a transfer of the
training beneﬁts between different mechanisms, recognition vs
recall. This promising result may serve to delay cognitive decline
in the pre-clinical stage of AD since recall is one of the core
cognitive impairments. In this line, Rozzini et al. (2007) showed
that CT combined with anticholinesterase inhibitor therapy induced
more cognitive beneﬁts than pharmacological treatment alone.
Thus, the effect of training may be potentiated by the combination
of a non-medicinal treatment and medication. This combination
could be promising for preventing dementia. Surprisingly, despite
the challenge, few studies have been conducted on the effect of
CT in MCI subjects at risk of developing AD. Training of memory
only has resulted in limited improvement (Troyer et al., 2008).
In contrast, multidomain computer-based CT can signiﬁcantly
improve most cognitive functions, e.g., learning (G¨unther, Sch¨afer,
Holzner, & Kemmler, 2003), behavioral memory (Cipriani et al.,
2006), episodic memory and abstract reasoning (Rozzini et al.,
2007), and long-term visual spatial memory (Talassi et al., 2007).
However, these studies used a combination of several interven-
tional approaches, which makes interpretation of results and
comparison between studies difﬁcult.
4.1. Beneﬁcial effects on recognition
In the present study, the increased scores on neuropsycholo-
gical tests assessing recognition might be expected since the CT
program was exclusively based on recognition. However, note
that according to dual processes models, recognition memory is
supported by the dissociable processes of recollection and famil-
iarity. Familiarity is thought to be spared in normal aging whereas
recollection is not. The rare studies on this subject in patients
with AD suggest the impairment of memory is due to deﬁcits in
both recollection and familiarity (Smith & Knight, 2002). Studies
on A-MCI reported an impairment of recollection processes (Serra
et al, 2010). Regarding familiarity, the data are conﬂicting. Some
reported a preservation of familiarity (Anderson et al., 2008;
Serra et al., 2010; Westerberg et al., 2006), while others reported
an impairment (Ally, Gold, & Budson, 2009; Wolk, Signoff, &
Dekosky, 2008). We previously showed that impairment of
familiarity could depend on the nature of the modality tested
i.e. visual or visuospatial (Alescio-Lautier et al., 2007). It has been
suggested that the impairment of familiarity depends on the MCI
subtype. Indeed, deﬁcits were reported in A-MCImd (Ally et al.,
2009; Wolk et al., 2008) but not in A-MCI single domain
(Anderson et al., 2008; Serra et al., 2010). Since patients were
A-MCImd in the current study, the positive effects we observed
after CT based on familiarity forced-choice procedure suggest that
there is still sufﬁcient cerebral plasticity linked to this process to
allow training.
Our results support the hypothesis of Westerberg et al. (2006)
that enthorinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices are
partially damaged but can nonetheless continue to support
familiarity in A-MCI. Recent works suggested that sparing of
familiarity is associated with a compensatory increase in peri-
rhinal activity (Daselaar, Fleck, Dobbins, Madden, & Cabeza,
2006). Thus, it is likely that the CT, which focused on familiarity,
increased compensatory perirhinal activities and consequently
enhanced A-MCImd patients’ performances. Particularly note that
training using a familiarity procedure can enhance performance
in a task that involves recollection. This was the case for set B of
the Doors and People test. This set, in contrast to set A, could not
be resolved on the basis of only familiarity. It also requires
recollection processes (Holdstock, Gutnikov, Gaffan, & Mayes,
2000). According to this assumption, the improved performance
in set B showed that our recognition training procedure was able
to promote better recognition even though it requires, in addition
to familiarity, recollection processes.
Attention training with the visual focused attentional tasks
improved information processing, as shown by the decreased
reaction time in the training tasks while the percentage of correct
response increased (Fig. 1B1, B3). This effect was probably due to
perceptual facilitation and better ability to detect details through-
out the training. Thus, the increased recognition in set B of the
Doors and People test in trained A-MCImd could also reﬂect
better information extraction when similarity between target and
distractors were increased. Indeed, set B is based on processing,
which involves a large investment in attentional focus and
selectivity and speed of information processing. Distractors are
highly similar in color and form; to recognize the target door, one
must be able to fully and promptly analyze the image.

cognitive impairment. Neuropsychologia (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.04.012

4.2. Beneﬁcial effects on digit span
Higher scores were found in the forward digit span test in
trained MCI relative to controls. This effect could come from the
progressive increase in CT of the number of pictures or words to
memorize. In contrast, scores were not improved in the backward
digit span test, which requires active memory processing in
addition to immediate storage. We interpret this lack of improve-
ment as an absence of transfer of the beneﬁts of training from
recognition to recall when the task is in working memory.
4.3. Beneﬁcial effects on recall
Recall processes were improved in trained MCI. Remember
that the CT program was exclusively based on recognition. Since
recall was not trained, there was a generalization from recogni-
tion to recall processes. Interestingly, recall was improved for
short- and long-term processes in trained A-MCImd.
Improvement of short-term retrieval processes in trained
A-MCImd was shown by the increased scores in free recall. This
is likely due to a deeper encoding through various strategies such
as verbalization and association of ideas. In contrast, the lack of
enhancement of cued recall suggests that training acts more on
encoding than on retrieval processes.
Improvement of long-term retrieval processes in trained
A-MCI-md was shown by the increased scores in delayed recall
of the 16-item free and cued reminding test. Note that CT was
mainly based on short-term memory training. Thus, it is likely
that the enhancement of delayed recall could be explained by the
use of the spaced retrieval method (Laudauer & Bjork, 1978), which
promoted the maintenance of information. Belleville et al. (2006)
reported improved delayed free recall of lists of words after 2-month
multifactorial cognitive training. In this case, training was conducted
in groups and focused on teaching episodic memory strategies such
as visual imagery abilities, face-name associations, method of loci,
and verbal organization like categorization and hierarchization. Note
that delayed free recall is improved after many types of interven-
tions: group or individual training, and training based on memory
strategies or recognition processes. Because of the differences
between the training by Belleville et al. (2006) and our training, it
is likely that the positive effect was sustained by different cognitive
mechanisms and consequently by different cerebral substrates.
4.4. Long-term beneﬁcial effects
We found that improved recognition or recall lasted at least
6 months after training, suggesting a resistance to memory decline
in A-MCI-md. This result supports the idea that CT could favor
compensation mechanisms. However, note that memory perfor-
mances become vulnerable in the absence of training, as shown by
the increased variability in some scores. This leads us to think that,
as the disease progresses, compensatory mechanisms established
during training decline thereafter, resulting in lower cognitive
performance. If patients do not sustain training, the transfer gains
dissipate over time. This means that longer training could enhance
or maintain training-related cognitive beneﬁts over time and could
generate a greater resistance to cognitive decline in A-MCI-md
patients. Few studies have evaluated the maintenance of training.
Long-term studies in healthy older subjects suggested that the
positive effect of training is enduring. Willis et al. (2006) reported
positive functional beneﬁts at 5-year follow-up. Such long delays
have not been tested in subjects with MCI. For this population,
Rozzini et al. (2007) reported beneﬁts in episodic memory at
3-month follow-up in a combined CT and medication treatment
group compared with the medication-only and no treatment control
group. To conclude, the beneﬁcial effects we found on episodic recall
at 6-month follow-up are encouraging, but future studies should
fully document the long-term efﬁcacy of CT in subjects with MCI
and the impact on conversion to dementia.
4.5. Conclusion and prospects
Our results showed cognitive training improved episodic recall,
one of the memory components in the core cognitive impairment in
MCI patients at risk of converting to AD. These data are promising in
view of developing training methods to delay cognitive decline in
A-MCI patients. However, many points remain to optimize the
effects of training. In particular, the training tasks that best predict
improvement should be determined. We believe that the simulta-
neous training of memory and attention is an important parameter
that may explain the beneﬁcial effects of training. However, we are
not able to specify whether the positive effects are the result of a
particular memory and attention training task, or of several, or all.
Note that parameters were manipulated so that training tasks would
continue to challenge each patient’s abilities throughout training. In
our opinion, this is a prerequisite to promote the effects of training
but, in retrospect, we may have applied this rule too frequently. It
might have been more appropriate to promote stabilization of
training performance, i.e. increase the repetition of the exercise
without modifying parameters, before increasing the level of difﬁ-
culty. We could probably give more power to training. Moreover,
longitudinal and imaging studies should be conducted in particular
on the long-term maintenance of the beneﬁts of training, which may
reﬂect a persistent change in the cerebral substrates involved.
Finally, future research should focus on the effects of such training
on participants’ quality of life. Another group of A-MCImd patients
who completed the same cognitive training as that presented in this
study reported a positive impact on their self-esteem measured by
the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale (data not shown). It would be of
particular interest to evaluate the effects of such interventions on
objective measures collected in an ecological framework.
