ABSTRACT
Cognitive rehabilitation for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s
disease is readily available to the geriatric population. Initial evidence suggests that
techniques incorporating motivational strategies to enhance treatment engagement
may provide more beneﬁt than computerised training alone. Seventy four adults
with subclinical cognitive decline were randomly assigned to computerised
cognitive training (CCT), Cognitive Vitality Training (CVT), or an Active Control Group
(ACG), and underwent neuropsychological evaluations at baseline and four-month
follow-up. Signiﬁcant differences were found in changes in performance on the
Modiﬁed Mini Mental State Examination (mMMSE) and measures of verbal learning
and memory across treatment groups. Experimental groups showed greater
preservation of functioning on the mMMSE than the ACG group, the CVT group
performed better than the ACG group on one measure of verbal learning and both
measures of verbal memory, and the CCT group performed better than the ACG
group on one measure of verbal learning and one measure of verbal memory.
There were no signiﬁcant group differences between the CVT and CCT groups on
measures of verbal learning or memory. It was concluded that computerised
cognitive training may offer the most beneﬁt when incorporated into a therapeutic
milieu rather than administered alone, although both appear superior to more
generic forms of cognitive stimulation.

Introduction
The development of effective treatments that delay the onset of debilitating cognitive
symptoms in dementia is imperative to prepare the global health system to accommo-
date the growing inﬂux of persons with dementia. Recent scientiﬁc evidence suggests
that concurrent pharmacological and cognitive rehabilitation (CR) methods may have
more beneﬁt than medication alone in preserving function in patients suffering from
the early stages of dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD; Petersen, 2004; Van
Dyck, 2004). Cognitive rehabilitation for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early
AD is a promising intervention for the geriatric population to help curb the insidious
decline in cognitive and functional performance (Cipriani, Bianchetti, & Trabucchi,
2006; Loewenstein, Aceveda, Czaja, & Duara, 2004; Rozzini et al., 2007; Talassi et al.,
2007). Although speciﬁc remediation protocols vary across models, most include com-
puter-based, hierarchical repeated drill and practice exercises that target memory,
attention, and executive functions, aimed at enhancing cognitive function in MCI and
early AD.
Cognitive rehabilitation for patients with early AD may have a modest effect on
patients with neurodegenerative pathology but presents challenges for individuals
trying to adhere to these cognitive treatments (Choi & Twamley, 2013). Problems
with intervention adherence may be due to components of the primary cognitive
illness or secondary to geriatric depression, such as early memory deﬁcits or apathy
that may contribute to difﬁculties adhering to the treatment protocols (Clare et al.,
2011; Devanand et al., 2004). Rehabilitation techniques that incorporate motivational
strategies to enhance treatment engagement and cognitive outcome may beneﬁt
people with MCI. Indeed, increasing a patient’s motivation to adhere to cognitive reha-
bilitation has been associated with better outcome in schizophrenia (Choi & Medalia,
2005) and pain management (Kerns & Habib, 2004). Patients motivated to participate
consistently in order to achieve adequate treatment intensity is necessary for successful
rehabilitation efforts. Moreover, patients who are intrinsically motivated seem to obtain
greater cognitive and functional beneﬁts from the training itself (Choi & Medalia, 2005).
One study to date has investigated the potential impact of including motivational
instructional techniques in a CR programme for older adults with AD. Choi and
Twamley (2013) randomly assigned 69 patients with mild to moderate AD on any chol-
inesterase (ChEI) regimen (e.g., galantamine, donepezil, rivastigmine) to receive either
cognitive rehabilitation coupled with motivational variables (i.e., Cognitive Vitality Train-
ing; CVT) or computerised cognitive training alone (Posit Science’s BrainFitness 1.0).
Patients in the CVT group showed more preserved memory functioning compared to
the group receiving memory training alone at 6 months (p < .05). Patients and care-
givers in CVT reported better quality of life (p < .05) and less overall depressive symp-
toms (p < .05). A stepwise regression model showed that perceptions of self-efﬁcacy
and autonomy predicted memory outcome at 6-month follow-up, even after account-
ing for variance from baseline memory ability, overall dementia symptoms, and motiv-
ation (R2 = .53, p = .04).
The mechanisms leading to better outcome in this study are still not entirely clear,
but one can surmise that patients recently diagnosed with AD (and their caregivers)
experience a tremendous loss of control in their lives, and motivation therapies like
CVT can promote self-efﬁcacy, control, and psychological well-being in individuals
who begin to lose these qualities as part of their cognitive loss. This is consistent

with empirical evidence that medical treatments that incorporate patient-directed goals
and offer patients more control over treatment planning provide greater therapeutic
advantages over the traditional doctor-prescribed regimen (Brodie, Inoue, & Shaw,
2008; Kerns & Habib, 2004). Giving patients the ability to contextualise interventions
as related to personal life goals while retaining some element of self-efﬁcacy in
medical procedures may enhance treatment adherence and patient motivation.
Few well-controlled studies exist that address the efﬁcacy of computerised cognitive
rehabilitation methods in MCI and AD (Cipriani et al., 2006; Loewenstein et al., 2004;
Rozzini et al., 2007; Talassi et al., 2007). Meta-analyses of such studies reveal mixed
results, with some showing little evidence that such interventions make a difference
in cognition, while others document modest improvements in speciﬁc neuropsycholo-
gical domains and functional abilities (Clare & Woods, 2008; Sitzer, Twamley, & Jeste,
2006). Maintenance of treatment gains in the context of a progressive neurodegenera-
tive disease like AD is warranted. Treatment response, in relation to stage of disease, is
also in question. Cognitive interventions for individuals in the earliest stages of neurop-
sychological decline may help elucidate the initial efﬁcacy of treatment and the stability
of those improvements over time. This rationale emphasises the importance of identify-
ing effective cognitive and motivational interventions for MCI that can be implemented
before individuals enter the more advanced stages of decline and receive an AD
diagnosis.
This study follows up on the results of a pilot study (Choi & Twamley, 2013), which
showed the efﬁcacy of CR embedded in a motivational therapeutic milieu (i.e., CVT)
compared to treatment as usual for patients with mild to moderate AD. The current
study sought to compare directly this CVT method with more rigorous comparison con-
ditions that will delineate the value of incorporating such a motivational milieu into cog-
nitive training programmes for older adults with subclinical cognitive decline.
We hypothesised that individuals with subclinical cognitive decline who were
enrolled in CVT would demonstrate greater preservation in performance on measures
of learning and memory after completion of treatment than individuals enrolled in a
generic CR condition (i.e., CCT), who would demonstrate greater preservation of func-
tioning than individuals enrolled in an active control condition.
Methods
Participants
A total of 96 participants were recruited for this study, and completed the baseline neu-
ropsychological evaluation. Of those, 74 participants completed the full treatment, 7
completed a partial portion of the treatment, and 15 did not complete any portion of
the assigned treatment. The overall study attrition rate was 23%. Among those who
did not complete treatment, 6 participants dropped out after the baseline neuropsycho-
logical evaluation, 4 participants dropped out after completing a portion of the 2-month
follow-up evaluation, and 12 participants dropped out after completing the full 2-month
follow-up evaluation. Demographic, clinical, and baseline neuropsychological variables
were compared using one-way ANOVAs and chi-square analyses, and there were no sig-
niﬁcant differences on any of the demographic or clinical variables between those who
dropped out and those who completed the full treatment (all ps > .05). Table 1

summarises the demographic and clinical data of the participants who completed the
full treatment.
Among those participants who completed treatment, approximately 58% were male.
The mean age of the sample was approximately 76 years (SD = 8.75), and the mean edu-
cation was approximately 15 years (SD = 2.58). Approximately 58% of the sample were
non-Hispanic white, 19% African American, 18% Hispanic/Latino, and 5% Asian. The
mean Wide Range Achievement Test–Third edition (WRAT-3) Reading subtest score,
the premorbid IQ estimate, was 109.41 (SD = 7.23), suggesting that the estimated pre-
morbid intellectual functioning of this sample was in the average range. The majority
of participants (82%) were independent community dwellers. Very few participants
were currently prescribed acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or benzodiazepines (approxi-
mately 5% and 4%, respectively), and the severity of depression symptomatology on
a self-report measure, i.e., Beck Depression Inventory–Second edition (BDI-II Total
Score), was low (M = 6.39, SD = 4.13). The average length of time to complete treatment
was approximately 103 days (SD = 34.83), which is on par with the suggested 4-month
time frame.

Study procedures
The study sample was recruited through the Memory Disorders Center (MDC) at Colum-
bia University, which includes the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), Doctors
Private Ofﬁces at the Neurological Institute, and the Memory Disorders Clinic at the
New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) as well as through the Department of
Geriatric Psychiatry at the VA Connecticut Healthcare System.
Diagnosis of subclinical cognitive decline was established by (1) subjective or infor-
mant memory complaints; (2) verbal memory impairment, as measured by > 0.5 SD
decline on Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) Logical Memory (LM) II or
Buschke Selective Reminding Test (BSRT); (3) normal general cognitive function, as
determined using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score > 24; and (4)
normal independent functioning as determined by physician report and > 75 percentile
score on Independent Living Scales (ILS).
All participants were assessed on baseline neuropsychological measures following
inclusion into protocol, but, prior to randomisation, all participants were re-assessed
on all outcome measures at 4 months. The following domains were assessed:
1. Premorbid intellectual functioning was assessed using the WRAT-3 (Gladsjo, Heaton,
Palmer, Taylor, & Jeste, 1999; Wilkinson, 1993).
2. Global cognition was assessed using the Modiﬁed Mini Mental State Examination
(mMMSE; Stern, Mayeux, Sano, Hauser, & Bush, 1987). This instrument included all
items from the standard Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein,
& McHugh, 1975), plus the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Revised Digit Span
subtest and additional attention/calculation and general knowledge, language,
and construction items.
3. Explicit verbal learning and memory were assessed using the BSRT (Buschke, 1973;
Strauss, Sherman, & Spreen, 2006) and the WMS-R LM I and II subtests (Wechsler,
1997).
4. Explicit visual learning and memory were assessed using the WMS-R Visual Repro-
ductions (VR) I and II subtests (Wechsler, 1997).
5. Self-reported mood symptoms were assessed using the BDI-II (Beck, Steer, & Brown,
1996).
Treatment phase
This randomised clinical trial used a test–re-test treatment controlled design with
recruited patients randomly assigned to one of three research arms—Computerised
Cognitive Training (CCT), Cognitive Vitality Training (CVT), or an Active Control Group
(ACG). The treatment phase sessions were provided in individual or group format,
twice per week, with each session lasting approximately 60 minutes. Total exposure
was the same for all treatment groups, and required approximately 30 hours of training
within a 16-week period.
Computerised Cognitive Training (CTT)
Participants assigned to the CCT group participated in Posit Science’s BrainFitness
(Mahncke, Bronstone, & Merzenich, 2006). This neuroscience cortical plasticity-based
NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION

training programme is speciﬁcally designed for use with older adults, and incorporates
repeated drill-and-practice exercises involving memory, attention, and executive func-
tions within domain-speciﬁc training modules that allow for adaptive training with
titrated difﬁculty levels. BrainFitness version 2.0.1, which incorporates speciﬁc
modules for geriatric treatment, was used for this study, and has demonstrated
success in various large-scale multi-centre trials to improve neuropsychological func-
tioning in older populations (Mahncke et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2009; Zelinski et al.,
2011).
Cognitive Vitality Training (CVT)
Participants assigned to the CVT group participated in a programme that incorporates
empirically-validated motivational teaching and rehabilitation techniques into a highly
engaging programme that emphasises enjoyment, intrinsic motivation, and active par-
ticipation, while also engaging in a more traditional computer-based memory training
programme. Pilot data collected by the principal investigator of this study (J.C.)
suggested that optimal treatment intensity and dosage to obtain measurable improve-
ments on outcome measures requires approximately 30 hours of training within a
16-week period. CVT consists of a traditional computerised cognitive rehabilitation pro-
gramme (CCT) that is embedded within the Neuropsychological and Educational
Approach to Remediation (NEAR) model of treatment (Medalia, Revheim, & Herlands,
2009).
Participants in the CVT group completed the same exercises as the CCT group using
the BrainFitness programme described above, but within an incorporated motivational
therapeutic milieu based on the principles put forth by NEAR. In short, studies of NEAR
have demonstrated that individuals perform better on cognitive rehabilitation tasks if
they are (1) allowed to personalise the incidental features in the training programme
(i.e., can set personal goals rather than follow clinician-set goals), (2) provided choice
over the aspects of the training activity (i.e., can select module of choosing and set per-
sonal time constraints), and (3) allowed to contextualise the training into a meaningful,
real-world situation (i.e., training programme embedded into the context of high-inter-
est or real-world themes, such as sport games or simulating a business transaction; Choi
& Medalia, 2005). In addition to improved task performance, individuals enrolled in CR
programmes that are speciﬁcally designed to increase motivation, such as NEAR, obtain
greater neuropsychological and functional beneﬁts from the training itself (Medalia &
Richardson, 2005). The computer software described above (i.e., BrainFitness 2.0.1)
allows for the manipulation of these three components of NEAR (i.e., personalisation,
autonomy, and contextualisation), with the goal of promoting independence, treatment
engagement, intrinsic motivation, and self-efﬁcacy. Individuals in the CVT group were
also encouraged to include a caregiver to be actively involved in the programme by par-
ticipating in the feedback and information sessions.
Active Control Group (ACG)
Participants assigned to the ACG worked on various commercially available computer
games and puzzles (i.e., BrainAge, Sudoku, crossword puzzles). Participants in this
group worked on the computerised games in a similar format to individuals in the
CCT and CVT groups (either at the hospital or remotely from home), and treatment
dosage and intensity were identical to the CCT and CVT groups (i.e., a total of two
hours per week). Including this group allowed for control of the effects of clinician
6

contact, and the potential nonspeciﬁc effects of cognitive exercise. This paradigm
helped determine whether neuroscience-based cognitive rehabilitation treatments
are more effective at improving memory ability than the mentally stimulating puzzles
and games readily available to the public.
Data analysis
Treatment response (i.e., preservation of neuropsychological functioning) was deﬁned
using change scores from baseline to four-month follow-up on all neuropsychological
measures utilising data for the 74 participants who completed treatment. While the
reliable change index and standardised regression-based models are typically used in
clinical settings to evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of changes in neuropsychological
test scores over time (Barr, 2002), the goal of this study was to evaluate absolute
changes in performance from baseline to four-month follow-up. Thus, change scores
for this study were calculated by subtracting the baseline standard scores from the
four-month follow-up standard scores on these same measures. When possible, stan-
dard scores (adjusting for age and/or education and gender) were used for analyses
of all dependent variables, to allow for more clinically meaningful interpretation of
the results. For neuropsychological variables, better treatment response is indicated
by higher (at or above zero) change scores, which indicates either stable performance
or improvement after treatment, and worse treatment response is indicated by lower
(below zero) change scores, which indicates declines after treatment. For the BDI-II
change score, better treatment response is indicated by lower (at or below zero)
change scores, which indicates either stable mood symptoms or improvement after
treatment, and worse treatment response is indicated by higher (above zero)
changes scores, which indicate worsening mood symptoms after treatment. All
change scores were operationalised as continuous variables that may be either positive
or negative.
Results
Tables 2 and 3 summarise the neuropsychological functioning for the participants who
completed treatment at baseline and at four-month follow-up. Results of one-way
ANOVAs revealed that the three groups did not differ with respect to baseline perform-
ance on any of the demographic, clinical, or dependent variables (all ps > .05). In terms
of the change scores (also reported in Table 3), the mean change scores on measures of
verbal learning (i.e., BSRT Total T-score and LM-I Percentile), verbal memory (i.e., BSRT
Delay T-Score and LM-II Percentile), and visual memory (i.e., VR-II Percentile), were all
positive, suggesting that participants demonstrated improvement after completion of
treatment. Similarly, a mean increase of 1.27 points was seen on the mMMSE from base-
line to four-month follow-up. However, the same trend was not observed for the
measure of visual learning (i.e., VR-I), which suggests a decline from baseline to four-
month follow-up.
Table 4 summarises the results of a series of one-way ANOVAs comparing the depen-
dent variables across the three treatment groups (i.e., ACG, CCT, and CVT). Consistent
with the study’s hypotheses, the three treatment groups were signiﬁcantly different
on changes in performance on a measure of global cognition, i.e., mMMSE, F(2, 71) =
11.56, p < .001, h2
r = .25; one measure of verbal learning, i.e., BSRT Total T-score, F(2,

71) = 5.00, p < .01, h2
r = .12; and two measures of verbal memory, i.e., BSRT Delay T-
score, F(2, 71) = 8.55, p < .001, h2
r = .19, LM-II, F(2, 71) = 5.78, p = 01, h2
r = .14. Tukey’s
HSD tests showed that both experimental groups showed greater preservation of func-
tioning on a measure of global cognition than the ACG group; the CVT group performed
better than the ACG group on one measure of verbal learning and both measures of
verbal memory; and the CCT group performed better than the ACG group on one
measure of verbal learning and one measure of verbal memory. There were no signiﬁ-
cant group differences between the CVT and CCT groups on measures of verbal learning
or memory.

In contrast to the study’s hypotheses, the results revealed that the groups did not
differ on changes in performance on a measure of visual learning (ps > .10). However,
there was a trend towards signiﬁcance on changes in performance on measures of
visual memory, F(2, 71) = 2.52, p = .09, h2
r = .07. Moreover, trends towards signiﬁcance
were observed on changes in performance on another measure of verbal learning, i.e.,
WMS-R LM-I; F(2, 71) = 2.83, p = .07, h2
r = .07.
In terms of emotional functioning, the results revealed that the three treatment
groups were signiﬁcantly different on changes in overall depressive symptomatology,
i.e., BDI-II, F(2, 71) = 3.50, p = .04, h2
r = .09. Tukey’s HSD tests showed that the partici-
pants receiving CVT showed a relative decrease in mood symptoms after treatment
compared to the ACG group, who showed a relative increase in mood symptoms.
There were no signiﬁcant differences between the CVT and CCT groups, or between
the CCT and ACG groups.

Discussion
This study revealed signiﬁcant differences in changes in performance on the mMMSE
and measures of verbal learning and memory across the three treatment groups (i.e.,
CVT, CCT, ACG). Although between-group comparisons did not reveal signiﬁcant differ-
ences between the CVT and CCT groups, the participants enrolled in CVT did demon-
strate the largest treatment gains, and these treatment gains were signiﬁcantly
greater than those that were observed in the ACG group, who demonstrated subtle
declines in performance following completion of treatment. Effect sizes generally
suggest moderate to high practical signiﬁcance, and on average participants in CVT
improved by approximately 6.5 T-score points on a measure of verbal learning (i.e.,
BSRT Total Recall), and by approximately 13.2 T-score points on a measure of verbal
memory (i.e., BSRT Delay Recall). The ACG group, meanwhile, demonstrated subtle
declines on most measures. Additionally, the mMMSE score for the participants in the
CVT group increased by an average of 2.78 points, compared to only 1.45 points in
the CCT group; again, the ACG group declined by approximately 0.75 points in only
four months. These ﬁndings are particularly meaningful in light of the fact that none
of the treatment groups had signiﬁcantly differed with respect to their performances
on these measures at baseline. Furthermore, these results are consistent with the
aims of this study, which hypothesised that participants in the CVT and CCT conditions
would have greater cognitive gains than the ACG group; however, the hypothesis that
CVT would be speciﬁcally superior to CCT was not supported.
In addition to the changes in neuropsychological status, the individuals in the CVT
group showed the greatest beneﬁt in terms of mood symptoms. On average, partici-
pants enrolled in the CVT group showed subtle reductions in their total depressive
symptomatology (i.e., BDI-II), while those enrolled in either the CCT or ACG conditions
showed relative increases in their total depressive symptomatology, with statistical
differences again noted between CVT and ACG but not between CVT and CCT.
Several limitations to this study should be noted, however, including the restricted
demographics of this sample (i.e., high levels of education and low representation of
racial/ethnic minorities) and a higher than expected rate of attrition (23%), which
may have resulted in a biased sample that may contain individuals with a signiﬁcantly
different clinical course than those individuals who discontinued study participation
prior to the four-month follow-up evaluation. However, the nature of how they differ
remains ambiguous, since participants who dropped out did not differ with respect
to any of the demographic, clinical, or neuropsychological variables compared to
those who completed treatment. Also, this study did not include measures to assess
everyday functioning (i.e., managing ﬁnances or medications), and thus the generalisa-
bility of these cognitive gains to real-word performance is unknown.
Nonetheless, these ﬁndings are particularly signiﬁcant as the global healthcare
system prepares to accommodate an inﬂux of older adults with dementing illnesses.
It is imperative to develop effective treatments to delay the onset of the cognitive
decline associated with AD. Even a temporary delay in cognitive decline will have a sig-
niﬁcant impact on the high treatment costs associated with the disease. Some estimates
suggest that preventing a 2-point decline on the MMSE could save a family thousands of
United States dollars annually, while a 2-point increase in MMSE score would save even
more (Ernst, Hay, Fenn, Tinklenberg, & Yesavage, 1997).

These ﬁndings are somewhat convergent from the existing literature, which suggest
the superiority of CVT compared to CCT in the preservation of memory functioning for
individuals with AD (Choi & Twamley, 2013). However, the participants recruited for this
study were notably much less impaired on the clinical spectrum than those in the
former study, which had more stringent cutoffs for deﬁning impairment and identifying
individuals with mild-to-moderate AD. Nonetheless, considerable evidence suggests
that cognitive rehabilitation treatments, especially the more comprehensive models
that incorporate motivational techniques, are effective at improving both cognitive
skills and real-world functioning in individuals with psychiatric illness, and studies
have demonstrated that patients who are intrinsically motivated obtain even greater
cognitive and functional beneﬁts from the training itself (Choi & Medalia, 2005).
Although we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences between CVT and CCT, our results do
support the notion that comprehensive models that incorporate motivational tech-
niques may be superior to other cognitively stimulating activities, such as word
puzzles, Sudoku, and other commercially available games. What remains to be seen,
however, is whether these treatment gains are sustained over time. For this reason,
future research from our laboratory aims to re-examine outcomes at one year following
completion of treatment.
These ﬁndings are of practical clinical signiﬁcance, because patients with subclinical
cognitive decline and early stages of dementia may have difﬁculty adhering to cognitive
rehabilitation techniques due to overlapping depressive symptoms such as poor motiv-
ation and poor concentration (Clare et al., 2011; Devanand et al., 2004). Although our
results are mixed, rehabilitation techniques like Cognitive Vitality Training (CVT),
which stress motivational strategies to enhance treatment engagement, may still
beneﬁt the cognitive function of people with subclinical cognitive decline. Given the
multitude of cognitive rehabilitation methods available, and particularly given the
advent of commercial software readily available for purchase (e.g., Lumosity, Posit
Science, etc.), clarifying the short-term and long-term beneﬁts of various treatments
will be important to ensure that clients are receiving maximal beneﬁt from therapy.
