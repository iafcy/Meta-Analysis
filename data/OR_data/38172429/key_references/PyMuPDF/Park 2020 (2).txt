Abstract: The present study examined whether a culture-based virtual reality (VR) training program
is feasible and tolerable for patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and whether
it could improve cognitive function in these patients. Twenty-one outpatients with aMCI were
randomized to either the VR-based training group or the control group in a 1:1 ratio. The VR-based
training group participated in training for 30 min/day, two days/week, for three months (24 times).
The VR-based program was designed based on Korean traditional culture and used attention,
processing speed, executive function and memory conditions to stimulate cognitive function.
The adherence to the culture-based VR training program was 91.55% ± 6.41% in the VR group.
The only adverse events observed in the VR group were dizziness (4.2%) and fatigue (8.3%).
Analysis revealed that the VR-based training group exhibited no signiﬁcant diﬀerences following
the three-month VR program in Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) scores, working
memory functions such as performance on the digit span test, or in Stroop test performance and word
ﬂuency. We conclude that although the 12-week culture-based VR training program did not improve
cognitive function, our ﬁndings revealed that the culture-based VR training program was feasible
and tolerable for participants with aMCI.

1. Introduction
Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a condition of declined cognitive function that
might indicate the early phases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or other dementias [1]. Patients with
aMCI are considered to be in the stage between normal aging and dementia, and still have the ability

to perform daily errands [1,2]. Therefore, early intervention at the aMCI stage can allow patients to
retain and even improve their cognitive function [3].
Innovative technologies have recently played an important role in cognitive assessment, cognitive
modeling, and changes in the ﬁeld of neuropsychology [4,5]. In particular, virtual reality (VR) is a
tool that allows subjects to be completely involved in an imitation of an actual situation, which is
rich in temporal naturalistic and spatial contexts. VR helps to address a number of limitations in
the research of cognitive function due to its distinct characteristics [6]. It is noted that VR shares the
same basic mechanism with the human brain—embodied simulation—and thus with this embodied
technology it is possible to facilitate cognitive modeling and change by designing virtual environments
to simulate both the external and internal world [7]. Therefore, VR has emerged as a rising tool
of cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive rehabilitation for aMCI and dementia [8]. Previous
studies reported that performance in VR applications has been shown to correlate with subjective
memory complaints [9], and VR applications have exhibited promising results during the assessment
of cognitive functions [9,10]. A feasibility study targeting healthy older adults showed that participants
were motivated by VR-based tasks and environment, and that these tasks and environments could be
helpful to improve the participants’ memory in a laboratory setting [11].
However, previous studies are limited in several aspects. Firstly, a majority of previous VR
studies has been conducted in Western countries, and limited studies have been conducted in the
context of culture-based VR. In particular, culture-based VR training programs for subjects of diﬀerent
cultural or environmental backgrounds are still needed. For example, a program can be designed
based on a Korean traditional game, which may spur older Korean adults’ memory and increase
their motivation to attend a VR training program. Secondly, previous studies were also limited by
only focusing on memory. It remains unclear what the eﬀects of VR-based training programs are on
diﬀerent domains of cognitive function, such as attention, executive function and processing speed.
Finally, most previous studies were conducted in community-based settings [11], which may be limited
by a lack of professionals to perform neuropsychological assessments. To ﬁll these research gaps,
the present study used a clinical setting and aimed to examine: (1) whether a culture-based VR training
program is feasible and tolerable for patients with aMCI; and (2) the eﬀect of a 12-week culture-based
VR training program on diﬀerent domains of cognitive function among patients with aMCI.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants
Patients aged between 50 and 80 years with a diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment
(aMCI) were eligible in the present study. Based on the operationalized Petersen aMCI criteria [1],
the inclusion criteria were as follows:
1.
Normal mental status: A MMSE score of more than 1.5 Standard Deviations (SD) below age- and
education-adjusted normative means [12,13].
2.
Memory complaint: A subjective memory complaint that was conﬁrmed by an informant.
3.
Impaired memory: A delayed recall score on the Seoul Verbal Learning test < 1 SD below age-
and education-adjusted normative means [14,15].
4.
Not demented: A Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale of <0.5 [16].
5.
Normal daily functioning: the Seoul Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) ≤7 [17].
All subjects were not diagnosed with dementia, had a Hachinski Ischemic Score of ≤4 [18], and a
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan showing no other
condition that could cause cognitive impairment.
The exclusion criteria included the following: (1) The subject had a history of stroke or was being
treated for a stroke or epilepsy; (2) the subject had other suspected degenerative diseases or mental
illnesses; and (3), subjects who were depressed or abusing substances, had head injuries, thyroid

malfunction or other medical abnormalities that could impair cognitive function. We conducted this
study according to the International Harmonization Conference guidelines on Good Clinical Practice.
The procedure of this study was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board of Dong-A University
Hospital. All subjects or their legally authorized representatives provided written informed consent for
the participation in the study. Finally, subjects were 21 out-patients with aMCI, who were randomized
to either the VR-based training group or the control group. This study was registered in the University
Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) Clinical Trials Registry (no. UMIN000030187).
2.2. Study Design
The patients who had been diagnosed with aMCI by a dementia clinician from a memory and
dementia clinic at a university hospital were recruited. We used Statistical Analysis System (SAS)
programming to randomly assign the participants with a 1:1 ratio to a VR group (n = 10) and a control
group (n = 11) by the block randomization method. The VR-based training program was designed as a
multicomponent restorative cognitive function training. Participants in the control group were asked
to maintain their normal daily activities during the study, and were informed that they would be able
to participate in the virtual reality (VR)-based training program after the end of the study. Assessments
were performed before the start of the VR-based training program (baseline) and after the intervention
(follow-up). The procedure of this study is shown in Figure 1.

2.3. Neuropsychological Assessment
Neuropsychological assessment in this study included general cognitive assessments,
the assessment of depression symptoms and detailed neurocognitive function.
According to
standardized methods, neuropsychologists from a hospital performed the general cognitive assessments
on the potential subjects, including the K-MMSE [12,13]. The 15-item Korean version of the Geriatric
Depression Scale (SGDS-K) was utilized to measure the subjects’ depression symptoms [19,20].
The Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery, Dementia version (SNSB-D) was used to evaluate
detailed neurocognitive function [14,15], which includes tests for attention, frontal lobe executive
function and verbal functions. The digit span test (forward and backward) was used to assess the
function of attention [21]. Moreover, the Korean color-word Stroop test was utilized to assess frontal
lobe executive function [14,15]. Finally, word ﬂuency tests (category and letter ﬂuency) were utilized
to measure verbal function [22].
2.4. Culture-Based VR Training Program
The head-mounted displays consisted of a headset, two controllers and two infrared laser emitter
units (HTC Vive, New Taipei City, Taiwan). The HTC Vive used an organic LED display and had an
integrated resolution of 2160 × 1200 (1080 × 1200 per eye), with a refresh rate of 90 Hz and a ﬁeld of
view of approximately 110 degrees. The weight of the head-mounted display is approximately 555 g.
The head-mounted display had HDMI 1.4, DisplayPort 1.2 and USB 2.0 connections [23].
The VR-based training group underwent training for 30 min/day, two days/week for three months,
corresponding to a total 24 times. The VR-based training program was conducted to aid attention,
processing speed, executive function and memory conditions, in order to stimulate cognitive function.
In each session, 10 min of warm-up and 20 min for two selected games (i.e., memory and/or attention
and/or executive function, processing speed) were set for participants according to their level of ability
(i.e., high, middle or low), requirements and choice. In VR games, neurologists prepared speciﬁc
cognitive tasks such as memory function and processing speed while playing games for the elderly.
An occupational therapist demonstrated the game controls and gave instructions to ensure that the
participants understood how to control the system. The participants were asked to rest and stretch
their eyes for a short time when their hypertonicity interfered with the control of the game.
Attention was assessed using the “Crows and Seagulls” game. This game involves shooting
crows among seagulls, and helps to improve the level of attention and perceptual space skills.
The setting of this game is a traditional bridge in Korea. “Seek a Song of Our Own” is a game
that involves participants hitting targets on a screen according to the rhythm and drumming of the
“Janggu”, the Korean traditional drum. This game is for elderly participants, and aims to improve
the participants’ level of attention. Processing speed was assessed using the “Automated Teller
Machine (ATM) machine” game, which involves withdrawing money according to a given amount
on the screen. This game aimed to improve numerical ability and perceptivity. To assess frontal lobe
executive function, the “Shopping in the Mart” game was used; this game involves shopping in a mart
for items needed by the participants’ family. This game aimed to improve the level of perceptivity,
numerical ability and logical ability. Both the “ATM machine” and “Shopping in the Mart” games were
designed based on activities of daily living. Korean Memory was assessed using the “Fireworks Party”
game, which involves decorating a night sky by launching ﬁreworks in a numerical order. This game
aimed to improve and train the memory of participants. The “Fruit Cocktail” game was also used
to train memory, in which participants made a cocktail by answering questions. Table 1 shows the
detailed protocols of the VR-based training program. Figure 2 shows examples of culture-based VR
training tasks.

2.5. Statistical Analysis
We used IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for data analysis in the
present study. A Shapiro–Wilk test was used to test the assumptions of distributional normality, and
showed that the distribution of all parameters did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from normal. The student’s
t-test was utilized to compare the baseline variables. We also utilized a two-factor repeated-measures
analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the interaction (group × time) eﬀects for all outcome
variables. All results are shown as the mean ± SD. A signiﬁcant level was set at 0.05.
3. Results
The socio-demographic, physical, mental and cognitive baseline characteristics of the participants
are shown in Table 2. At baseline, no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed in any of the characteristics
between the virtual reality (VR) group and the control group. The results also showed that the adherence
to the VR-based training program was 91.55% ± 6.41% in the VR group. The only adverse events
observed in the treatment groups were dizziness (4.2%) and fatigue (8.3%) during the three-month VR
program (data not shown). Table 3 shows the changes in the mental and cognitive function of the VR
and control groups at baseline and after 12 weeks. At baseline, no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the SGDS-K
scores between the two groups were found. For the SGDS-K scores, the two-way repeated-measures
ANOVA indicated no main eﬀect of time and no interaction between time and group. Within-group
analysis indicated that the SGDS-K scores did not change signiﬁcantly in either group after 12 weeks, but
the values tended to be lower than the baseline values in the VR group after 12 weeks (95% CI = −0.87
to 3.07 score, p = 0.240). For the K-MMSE scores, the two-way repeated-measures ANOVA indicated
no interactions between time and group. Within-group analysis indicated that the K-MMSE scores did

not change signiﬁcantly in either group after 12 weeks. We found no signiﬁcant changes for both the
between-group and within-group analysis of the digit span, Stroop and word ﬂuency test results.

4. Discussion
This study ﬁlls a research gap, and is the ﬁrst that uses a clinical setting to examine the eﬀect
of culture-based virtual reality (VR) training programs on diﬀerent domains of cognitive function,
and their tolerability in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Our ﬁndings
showed that the 12-week culture-based VR training program did not improve diﬀerent domains of
cognitive function. Nevertheless, our results further revealed that the culture-based VR training
was well-tolerated (negative event of dizziness was 4.2% and fatigue was 8.3%), and with good
compliance (compliance rate: 91.55% ± 6.41%) during the three-month VR program in our study
sample. Our ﬁndings may inform therapists and rehabilitation personnel that culture-based VR
training programs can be a promising tool for future training programs for patients with aMCI in the
context of culture-based.
Contrary to our hypothesis, our 12-week culture-based VR training program did not improve
cognitive function among patients with aMCI compared to the control group. Although existing
literature shows that VR is an embodied technology that facilitates cognitive modeling and change by
designing virtual environments to simulate both the external and internal world [7], there are several
possible explanations for this inconsistency. Firstly, it is inconsistent with a previous study [24] that
reported that long-term intervention (six months of VR memory training) in the elderly signiﬁcantly
improved memory function. Moreover, a previous review also reported that short-term VR-based
training programs are less eﬀective in improving cognitive function during aMCI or dementia [25].
The short duration of our study might explain this diﬀerence in results in patients with aMCI. Another
possible explanation could be that our culture-based VR training program was designed to assess
attention, executive function and memory conditions in order to stimulate cognitive function, but
was not designed for dual tasks (i.e., both cognitive and exercise training). An important review
has indicated that exercise plays a critical role in the prevention of dementia [26], and can improve
cognitive function in aMCI patients [27]. Previous studies have shown that dual tasks (cognitive and
exercise training) could have positive eﬀects on cognitive function among the elderly. For example,
Anderson-Hanley et al [28]. found that older adults who participated in stationary cycling with virtual
reality tours had improved cognitive function compared to traditional exercisers, which suggested
that engaging in both cognitive and physical exercise could be eﬀective for the prevention of cognitive
decline [28]. Therefore, future intervention studies may consider using VR-based exercise and cognitive
training programs to further conﬁrm the eﬀects of these programs on cognitive function among patients
with aMCI.
The present study had some limitations. First, this study is a pilot study, and thus the sample
size was small, which limits the statistical power to determine the signiﬁcance of our ﬁndings. Thus,
it is still required for further studies using larger sample sizes to identify the eﬀectiveness of regular
VR-based training. Second, the time spent in physical activity outside our study was not measured in
our participants, and might potentially inﬂuence the results of the study. Third, potential confounders
such as diet, physical activity, sleep and other cognitive activity were not controlled in this study, and
these lifestyle factors, such as physiological and dietary/nutritional proﬁles [29], as well as physical
activity [30] and sleep patterns, might aﬀect our results. Nevertheless, this study using a randomized
controlled design could avoid bias, and truly allows for a direct comparison between two groups.
Finally, there was only a VR-based intervention group and a control group in this study. Future studies
with an ideal active control condition would be needed.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, the present ﬁndings demonstrate that the 12-week culture-based virtual reality (VR)
training program did not improve diﬀerent domains of cognitive function during interaction, but the
VR-based training was well-tolerated and showed good compliance. Finally, it would be valuable to
investigate whether long-term modiﬁcations of the culture-based VR training program can help to
slow the progression of dementia in a large population.
