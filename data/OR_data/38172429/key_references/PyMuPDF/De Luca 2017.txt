Background: Cognitive impairment after stroke is common and can cause disabil-
ity with a high impact on quality of life and independence. Cognitive rehabilitation
is a therapeutic approach designed to improve cognitive functioning after central
nervous system’s injuries. Computerized cognitive rehabilitation (CCR) uses mul-
timedia and informatics resources to optimize cognitive compromised performances.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of pc cognitive training with Erica
software in patients with stroke. Methods: We studied 35 subjects (randomly divided
into 2 groups), affected by either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, having at-
tended from January 2013 to May 2015 the Laboratory of Robotic and Cognitive
Rehabilitation of Istituto di Ricerca e Cura a Carattere Scientiﬁco Neurolesi in Messina.
Cognitive dysfunctions were investigated through a complete neuropsychologi-
cal battery, administered before (T0) and after (T1) each different training. Results:
At T0, all the patients showed language and cognitive deﬁcits, especially in at-
tention process and memory abilities, with mood alterations. After the rehabilitation
program (T1), we noted a global cognitive improvement in both groups, but a
more signiﬁcant increase in the scores of the different clinical scales we admin-
istered was found after CCR. Conclusions: Our data suggest that cognitive pc training
by using the Erica software may be a useful methodology to increase the post-
stroke cognitive recovery. Key Words: Cognitive rehabilitation—computerized
training—neuropsychology—functional recovery.

Background
Stroke is one of the main causes of mortality in in-
dustrialized countries,1 and the leading cause of adult long-
term disability, often with signiﬁcant gait and upper limb
impairment.2
The prevalence of poststroke cognitive dysfunction varies
from 23% to 55% within 3 months from stroke onset, and
declines between 11% and 31% after 1 year.3-5
Most stroke patients may live with speciﬁc cognitive
deﬁcits, including attention and concentration,6 memory,7
spatial awareness,8 perception,9 praxis,10 and executive
functioning11 alterations with a signiﬁcant reduction in
daily life autonomy and quality of life.

The typical clinical strategy of recovery in patients af-
fected by stroke is to minimize the initial damage and
thereby to improve the amount of functional recovery.
Following stroke, it is possible that recovery could spon-
taneously occur, and improvement in neuropsychological
functioning is generally observed for at least 2 years after
brain injury. Indeed, Robertson and Murre indicated that
there are 3 groups of recovery likelihood: spontaneous
recovery, assisted recovery, and no recovery.12
Rehabilitative treatment, through integrative ap-
proaches, should allow a shifting from the simple
remediation/compensation dichotomy to a more valid skills
transfer and generalization.
Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is becoming a standard
component of neurorehabilitation after stroke, given that
there is important clinical and research evidence of ef-
ﬁcacy in improving cognitive and psychosocial functioning
in patients with brain injury.13,14
CR refers to 2 major categories of techniques, that is,
traditional and computer-assisted, computer-assisted cog-
nitive rehabilitation (CCR).
In both cases, the cognitive training implements the
residual neuropsychological abilities through speciﬁc strat-
egies based on cognitive models. In particular, CCR uses
multimedia and informatics resources with speciﬁc hard-
ware system and software, to implement the cognitive
training15,16 for memory,17 attention,18 problem solving, and
job simulation,19 language,20 praxis,21 and processing speed.22
Some clinical trials for stroke patients with neuropsy-
chological deﬁcits showed that the experimental group
(performing computerized training) had a greater im-
provement than the control group (performing only
conventional treatment, i.e., pen-and-paper exercises) in
different cognitive domains, such as attention, memory,
visual, and auditory learning.23
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of CCR,
by using the software Erica, on cognitive and daily life
performance, in stroke patients with cognitive impairment.
Material and Methods
Study Population
Thirty-ﬁve patients (mean ± SD age: 43.15 ± 16.85 years;
48.57% female) were enrolled in this study and random-
ized into either the control (CG: n = 15) or the experimental
(EG: n = 20) groups. A more detailed description of the
2 groups is in Table 1.
The patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups
(experimental or standard treatment) in order of recruiting.
This clinical, single-blind, randomized trial involved 35
stroke participants. All the patients needed CR based on
medical and neuropsychological team’s diagnosis. The
sample was enrolled from January 2013 to May 2015 at
the Laboratory of Robotic and Cognitive Rehabilitation
of Istituto di Ricerca e Cura a Carattere Scientiﬁco Neurolesi
of Messina. The study was approved by the Local Ethical
Committee. No participant was excluded from the study.
Either the patient or the legal representative were ade-
quately informed about the study and offered their
collaboration and written consent.
The patients enrolled were in a chronic phase (i.e., 3-6
months from the acute neurological event). The EG con-
sisted of 20 participants (11 men and 9 women, with a
mean age of 43.9 years ± 16.6), whereas the CG con-
sisted of 15 participants (7 men and 8 women, with a
mean age of 42.1 ± 17.7). As shown in Table 1 the 2 groups

were matched for age, sex, and educational level. Inclu-
sion criteria were (1) diagnosis of vascular brain injury
of either hemorrhagic or ischemic etiology (the latter in-
volving the middle cerebral artery); (2) presence of
moderate cognitive impairment, that is, Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) score ranging from 12 to 20; (3)
absence of severe spasticity with an Ashworth Scale less
than 3; (4) absence of disabling sensory alterations (i.e.,
hearing and visual loss), and of severe medical and psy-
chiatric illness according to the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) and
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases-10.
Procedures
Each patient was submitted to a complete neuropsy-
chological evaluation before and after the rehabilitative
treatment (T0 and T1, respectively). Neuropsychological
assessment consisted of a screening test, that is, the MMSE,
and speciﬁc test for different cognitive domains, includ-
ing the Category Verbal Fluency (CVF), Letter Verbal
Fluency, the Reversal Motor Learning (RML), the Atten-
tive Matrices (AM), and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning
Test (RAVLI immediate and late RAVLR recall). The func-
tional scales, which were ﬁlled with the help of the
caregivers, included Basic Activities of Daily Living (ADL)
and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Levels
of Cognitive Functioning (LCF), and Barthel Index (BI).
Depression and anxiety scales (i.e., Hamilton Rating Scale
for Anxiety, HRS-A, and for Depression, HRS-D) were
also administered.
All the study participants underwent the same tradi-
tional CR, 6 times a week for 8 weeks (i.e., 48 sessions
of 45 minutes each). In addition, the EG was submitted
to the pc-based Erica training, consisting of 24 sessions
of 45 minutes each, 3 times a week for 8 weeks, whereas
the CG performed only CR (24 sessions, 3 times a week
for 8 weeks).
To summarize, the 2 groups were submitted to the same
amount of neurorehabilitation, but only the EG per-
formed CCR.
Pc-cognitive training was realized by means of an Italian
computerized cognitive tool, Erica (with a user license
of 3 years; www.erica.giunti.it), which consists of a number
of personalized pc exercises, articulated in 5 speciﬁc cog-
nitive domains: attention process, memory abilities, spatial
cognition, verbal and nonverbal executive functions. This
platform of neuropsychological rehabilitation is charac-
terized by modularity, ﬂexibility, and uniformity in the
type of task and in the administered program. A trained
cognitive therapist provided exercises with a growing hi-
erarchy of complexity through the Erica rehabilitative
platform: the exercises’ difficulty was ﬂexible to the pro-
gressive changes of the patient’s performance, and
consistently ensured effective and pleasant rehabilita-
tion sessions.
CR consisted in a face-to-face approach between the
patient and the therapist that was administered in indi-
vidual sessions. Training was customized for the needs
of each patient. Indeed, tasks were presented using a paper-
and-pencil modality, and these were speciﬁcally built to
stimulate speciﬁc cognitive skills (16).
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using the R version 3.4.0, consid-
ering a P < .05 as statistically signiﬁcant. Normal distribution
of a sample was investigated through the Shapiro test,
whereas the Fisher test was used for comparing the vari-
ances of 2 samples from normal population.
Using the car package of R, for any outcome measure,
we performed a repeated measure within-subject anal-
ysis of variance for unbalanced design. We included into
the model the 2-level variable “group” (1 = experimen-
tal; 0 = control), as between factor, and the 2-level variable
“evaluation time” (T0, T1), as within factor. We also in-
cluded an interaction term for group and evaluation time.
The Student’s t test for unpaired sample and the Fisher
exact test were used to compare 2 groups (intergroup anal-
ysis), where appropriate. The Student’s t test for paired
sample was used to compare each group between the base-
line and the end of the study (intragroup analysis). Finally,
in order to investigate whether the improvement was more
signiﬁcant in the experimental group rather than in the
control group, we compared the test score variations from
baseline to follow-up (i.e., for each clinical test we com-
puted the difference between the 2 evaluation times as
|score at T1 to score at T0|) by the one-tailed Student’s
t test.
Results
At baseline, no signiﬁcant differences between the EG
and the CG were found.
There were no signiﬁcant differences between the 2
groups on score variation from T0 to T1, but rather an
effect due to the time for most of the scales/tests: MMSE
(F = 17.84; P < .001), Letter Verbal Fluency (F = 4.87; P = .034),
Digit Span (F = 12.20; P = .001), Token Test (F = 8.26;
P = .007), Ideomotor Apraxia (F = 5.25; P = .028), Con-
structive Apraxia (F = 13.52; P < .001), RAV (F = 11.37;
P = .002), and Boston Naming Test (F = 15.37; P < .001).
However, the interaction “group × evaluation time” was
signiﬁcant statistically for MMSE (F = 12.40; P = .001), CVF
(F = 5.38; P = .027), and AM (F = 10.65; P = .002) models.
Although no signiﬁcant differences between the EG and
the CG at T1 were found, the intragroup comparisons
showed some improvements in many clinical scales, es-
pecially for the EG (see Table 2). Finally, comparing the
test score variations from baseline to follow-up (Fig 1),
we found that the improvement in MMSE (t = 3.34;
P = .001), CVF (t = 2.55; P = .008), AM (t = 1.18; P < .001),
as well as BNT (t = 1.72; P = .047), HRS-A (t = 1.96; P = .030),

and HRS-D (t = 1.86; P = .036) was more evident in the
EG than in the CG.
Discussion
Emerging cognitive interventions, including CCR, virtual
reality, and telemedicine system may be useful to opti-
mize the quality and efficacy of rehabilitation in individuals
with neurological disorders, such as stroke.24 In
particular, the use of pc-cognitive retraining has multi-
ple potential beneﬁts within the rehabilitative setting
following brain injury: the repeatability of cognitive tasks,
the rapid presentation of stimuli with multisensory stim-
ulation, so as to boost neural plasticity and thus functional
recovery. The rehabilitation carried out by pc-based train-
ings allows strengthening of the residual cognitive abilities
as demonstrated by Fernandez et al, who considered the
effect of the computer-based cognitive training on 50

patients affected by brain injury, observing an increase
in the attention and memory processes.25 Our results
suggest that cognitive pc training, in addition to stan-
dard neurorehabilitation, may be a promising tool to
optimize the global neuropsychological and functional re-
covery in poststroke patients. Indeed, the concomitant use
of pc training may allow a signiﬁcant increase in overall
functioning and a positive inﬂuence in the optimization
of speciﬁc cognitive and functional domains. Despite these
results, there are only few evidences, concerning the CCR
efficacy on the cognitive impairment in the patients af-
fected by brain injury, including stroke. Among these, a
very interesting study by Chen et al demonstrated a sig-
niﬁcant improvement in the global cognitive function in
the individuals with traumatic brain injury who were sub-
mitted to CCR.26 Another study by Lundqvist et al showed
an improvement in the memory processes in 21 pa-
tients with acquired brain injury undergoing computerized
memory training.27 These results, conﬁrmed by our work,
demonstrated that neuropsychological computerized re-
habilitation could have a relevant impact in the
rehabilitative outcomes of poststroke patients. More-
over, recent studies have highlighted the potentiality of
the CCR supporting the global efficacy of such ap-
proach for the recovery of patients affected by different
neurological disorders.28,29
The novelty of this work is that it was the ﬁrst time
Erica, a speciﬁc software for the cognitive impairment
treatment, was used in patients with stroke. Indeed, a
recent review has demonstrated that CCR may be con-
sidered a good tool to optimize rehabilitation outcomes
following brain injury.28 Moreover, different neurophysi-
ological strategies, with regard to transcranial magnetic
stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation,
are demonstrating a positive effect in promoting neuro-
plasticity of the injured brain area, and thus better
functional and cognitive recovery.30,31
The main limitation of the study is that the sample is
small and probably it is not sufficient to prove the real
efficacy of CCR in the stroke population. Moreover, we
have investigated patients affected by either ischemic or
hemorrhagic stroke, which may have different kinds of
functional recovery. Thus, it could be interesting to eval-
uate a more homogeneous sample of ischemic patients,
presenting possible more homogeneous side lesions. In
spite of this, the study also shows some strength, as the
presence of a control group and a careful assessment of
the cognitive functions.
In conclusion, our data suggest that the PC-cognitive
training can be an additional approach for cognitive re-
habilitation after stroke, to improve the cognitive recovery
and the patients’ global functioning, especially concern-
ing the semantic/verbal ﬂuidity and the short-term
memory. In the near future, further larger sample studies
should be carried out, to conﬁrm these promising results
and evaluate the long-term effects.
