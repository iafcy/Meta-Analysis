Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) increases dementia risk with no pharmacologic treatment
available.
Methods: The Study of Mental and Resistance Training was a randomized, double-blind, double-sham
controlled trial of adults with MCI. Participants were randomized to 2 supervised interventions: active or
sham physical training (high intensity progressive resistance training vs seated calisthenics) plus active
or sham cognitive training (computerized, multidomain cognitive training vs watching videos/quizzes),
2e3 days/week for 6 months with 18-month follow-up. Primary outcomes were global cognitive function
(Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale; ADAS-Cog) and functional independence
(Bayer Activities of Daily Living). Secondary outcomes included executive function, memory, and speed/
attention tests, and cognitive domain scores.

Results: One hundred adults with MCI [70.1 (6.7) years; 68% women] were enrolled and analyzed.
Resistance training signiﬁcantly improved the primary outcome ADAS-Cog; [relative effect size (95%
conﬁdence interval) 0.33 (0.73, 0.06); P < .05] at 6 months and executive function (Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale Matrices; P ¼ .016) across 18 months. Normal ADAS-Cog scores occurred in 48% (24/49)
after resistance training vs 27% (14/51) without resistance training [P < .03; odds ratio (95% conﬁdence
interval) 3.50 (1.18, 10.48)]. Cognitive training only attenuated decline in Memory Domain at 6 months
(P < .02). Resistance training 18-month beneﬁt was 74% higher (P ¼ .02) for Executive Domain compared
with combined training [z-score change ¼ 0.42 (0.22, 0.63) resistance training vs 0.11 (0.60, 0.28)
combined] and 48% higher (P < .04) for Global Domain [z-score change ¼ .0.45 (0.29, 0.61) resistance
training vs 0.23 (0.10, 0.36) combined].
Conclusions: Resistance training signiﬁcantly improved global cognitive function, with maintenance of
executive and global beneﬁts over 18 months.

Dementia presents a major challenge to individuals, their care-
givers, and the health care system globally, with 135 million persons
projected to be affected by 2050.1 Thus, delay of dementia onset,
progression, and severity are among the most pressing challenges for
medical research today. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a diag-
nostic term applied to individuals in the intermediate stage between
normal cognitive function and dementia.2 MCI increases the risk
for dementia, with diagnosed individuals progressing at rates up to
6%e10% per year compared with 1%e2% in the general population.3
Pharmacologic treatments for dementia4 have not been effective in
MCI for either cognitive improvement or reduction of incident de-
mentia or its severity. Therefore, nonpharmacologic investigations
addressing cognitive decline are urgently recommended.5
There is strong evidence from cross-sectional, prospective cohort,
and experimental studies that participation in mentally and physi-
cally stimulating activities is associated with decreased dementia
prevalence and/or incidence as well as improved cognitive function in
healthy individuals and some clinical cohorts.6e8 Our meta-analysis9
and review of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in older
adults10 suggest effect sizes for cognitive outcomes of approximately
0.60 for cognitive training (CT), 0.59 for aerobic/resistance training,
and 0.53 for resistance training, compared with 0.15 for healthy
control groups. However, the evidence for efﬁcacy of any intervention
in those with MCI is less certain. For example, in our systematic re-
view of cognitive outcomes in 14 RCTs of exercise speciﬁcally in
MCI,11 42% of effect sizes were potentially clinically relevant (effect
size >0.20), but only 8% statistically signiﬁcant. Similarly, in our
systematic review of 10 cognitive/memory training trials in MCI,12
only 3 of the 5 RCTs had signiﬁcant effects, limited to memory.
Further, robustly designed trials with longitudinal follow-up have
been recommended in MCI to investigate the comparative beneﬁts of
isolated and combined physical and mental training.
Progressive resistance training (PRT) has been studied far less
extensively than aerobic training in MCI. However, the potential
utility of PRT is suggested by its beneﬁcial effects on insulin-like
growth factor-1,
insulin sensitivity, and anti-inﬂammatory and
brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathways, which are related to
both sarcopenia and cognitive decline,13,14 the observed positive ef-
fects of higher muscle/lean mass on cognition15 and brain size,16 as
well as a small number of positive clinical trials.11,17,18 Therefore, we
designed the Study of Mental Activity and Resistance Training
(SMART) trial19 to examine the isolated and combined beneﬁts of CT
and resistance training in MCI.
We hypothesized the following:
(1) Six months of supervised CT or PRT would signiﬁcantly
improve global cognitive function in older adults with MCI,
as assessed by our primary outcome: the Alzheimer’s Disease
Assessment
Scale-Cognitive
subscale
(ADAS-Cog)20
and
independence of function as assessed by the Bayer Activities of
Daily Living Scale (BAYER-ADL)21 at both 6- and 18-month
follow-up, relative to sham cognitive and sham exercise con-
trol conditions, respectively.
(2) Both CT and PRT would signiﬁcantly improve secondary
cognitive outcomes across memory, executive function, and
Attention/Speed Domains.
(3) The combination of CTandPRT would be signiﬁcantly superior to
either intervention alone for cognitive and functional beneﬁts.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
The full protocol for the SMART trial has been published,19 and the
protocol registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials
Registry Protocol No: X08-0064 (ANZCTR; http://www.ansctr.org.au).
The SMART trial is a randomized, fully-factorial, double-blind, double
sham training-controlled clinical trial adhering closely to Consoli-
dated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines for the conduct and
reporting
of
clinical
trials,
as
extended
to
nonpharmacologic
interventions.
Study Population and Eligibility Criteria
Participants were community-dwelling men and women aged 55
or above with MCI diagnosis, consistent with the Petersen criteria.22
Intervention Arms
Complete intervention details have been published19 and are
summarized below.
Dose and Supervision
All training was fully supervised by research assistants from ex-
ercise physiology or physical therapy backgrounds. Initial training
frequency of 3 days/week was reduced to 2 days/week after the ﬁrst
30 participants to minimize burden/transportation difﬁculties. Each
session took approximately 60e100 minutes on average (60 minutes
control, 75 minutes PRT, or CT groups, 100 minutes combined), but
varied according to the physical frailty or level of cognitive impair-
ment in each participant.
CT Intervention (þSham Exercise)
CT
intervention
involved
computer-based
multimodal
and
multidomain exercises targeting memory, executive function, atten-
tion, and speed of information processing. The training used the

COGPACK program,23 developed for neuro-rehabilitation and used in a
previous research trial with MCI, which no participant had used before.
Fourteen progressively more difﬁcult exercises were selected including
6 tasks of visual and verbal explicit memory, advancing to a more
difﬁcult task each session. Training sessions were completed in a su-
pervisedgroupsettingwithupto10computerwork stationsandsimple
touch screens to avoid training difﬁculties in the computer-naïve.
PRT (þSham Cognitive)
PRT was supervised by experienced research assistants (exercise
physiologists and physiotherapists) in a physician-supervised clinic at
the University of Sydney Exercise campus at a ratio of 1 trainer: 4e5
participants. Pneumatic resistance machines (Keiser Sports Health
Equipment, Ltd) were used for training at high intensity, 3 sets of 8
repetitions of each of 5e6 exercises/session for most major muscle
groups (chest press, leg press, seated row, standing hip abduction,
knee extension).
Combined CT and PRT
This
group
received
both
the
CT
intervention
and
PRT
interventions as above sequentially during the same session.
Control
The control group received both sham cognitive and sham exer-
cise interventions.
Sham Cognitive
Sham CT (sham cognitive) consisted of watching 5 short National
Geographic videos, followed by a set of 15 questions (3/video)
regarding the presented material, as has been used in previous tri-
als24 with minimal impact on cognitive outcomes. Feedback was not
provided unless requested speciﬁcally.
Sham Exercise
This group performed stretching and seated calisthenics designed
so as not to notably increase heart rate or aerobic capacity, nor
improve balance, enhance strength, or other physiological outcomes.
Adverse Events
Adverse events were deﬁned a priori as any exacerbation of un-
derlying disease, or new onset musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, or
metabolic abnormality attributed directly to study protocols. Moni-
toring of adverse events over 18 months was done prospectively by
weekly questionnaire/interview with proxy information obtained
whenever necessary.
Outcome Assessments
Blinded assessors administered all outcome measures at baseline,
6 and 18 months. Cognitive testing took place at least 72 hours after
the previous training session, in a fed state (after breakfast), and
before any physical testing on that day to standardize known effects
of fasting and acute exercise on cognitive performance.
Primary Outcomes
Details of cognitive assessments are presented in Supplementary
Table 1 and the published protocol.19 Global cognitive function was
assessed via the ADAS-Cog, and mental capacity to perform daily
tasks by the Bayer Activities of Daily Living (B-IADL), which has been
found to differentiate between normal aging and mild to moderate
dementia. Scores 5 on the ADAS-Cog (the mean score reported in
noncognitively impaired volunteers ages 55 to 89) were categorized
as normal.
Secondary Cognitive Outcomes
Executive function was assessed by Matrices and Similarities
subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 3rd Edition (WAIS-
III) and verbal ﬂuency (Controlled Oral Words Association Test
(COWAT) and Animal Naming). Memory tests included auditory
Logical Memory I (immediate) and II (delayed) subtests of the
Wechsler Memory Scale 3rd Edition (WMS-III)25 and the List Learning
subsection of the ADAS-Cog, and visual via Benton Visual Retention
Test-Revised 5th Edition (BVRT-R). Attention/speed was assessed via
Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Cognitive Domain scores were
calculated by creating and then averaging the z-scores of component
tests at each time point, referenced to whole-group baseline mean
and standard deviation. Global Domain included all tests except List
Learning, as it was already included within ADAS-Cog total score.
Executive Domain included WAIS Similarities and Matrices, COWAT,
and Animal Naming. Memory Domain included Logical Memory I and
II, List Learning, and BVRT-R.
Randomization, Stratiﬁcation, Concealment, and Allocation
A
concealed,
computer-generated
sequence
of
randomly
permuted blocks (block size ¼ 8) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to each of the 4
intervention arms, stratiﬁed by sex and age (<75 and 75 þ years),
was generated by a research assistant not otherwise involved in the
study via a statistical website (www.randomization.com created by
Dr. Gerard E. Dallal, Tufts University) at the completion of all baseline
assessments. Assignments were then placed in sealed opaque enve-
lopes and delivered to participants by the recruitment ofﬁcer.
Results
Recruitment and Retention
As shown in Figure 1, from the 2094 people contacted (primarily
via electoral roll), the majority were not interested/did not respond
(76%) or ineligible (3%) after telephone screening, or placed on hold
primarily for being too physically active (10%). Notably, among the
135 individuals diagnosed with MCI, 75% (100) were interested and
enrolled. Dropout rate was much lower than expected (8% and 12% at
6 and 18 months, respectively) because of commitment (5%), dissat-
isfaction (3%), or health (4%) issues. Six percent (n ¼ 6) discontinued
training, all because of commitment issues, not health or adverse
events.
Training Adherence and Fidelity
There were no group differences in the median training duration
of 26 (0e28) weeks. Absolute exercise adherence (number of ses-
sions) was equivalent between PRT and sham exercise: mean (stan-
dard deviation) 42 (19) vs 42 (20); P ¼ .96). The intended increase in
total tonnage (total weight lifted) over 6 months averaged 48 (49%),
with a nonsigniﬁcantly greater increase in the Combined Training
Group than isolated PRT [56 (46%) vs 38 (51%), respectively, P ¼ .21].
Absolute cognitive session adherence was higher in CT than sham
cognitive: [52 (19) vs 42 (22); P ¼ .02].

Adverse Events
There were 6 adverse musculoskeletal events over 18 months (3
falls during assessments and 3 exacerbations of pre-existing arthritis
symptoms
during
strength
testing/training,
with
1
unresolved
(exacerbation of an underlying rotator cuff tear).
Participants
Baseline
characteristics
of
participants
are
shown
in
Supplementary Table 2; there were no signiﬁcant group differences
(P > .05). All 100 participants and 93% of their informants reported
concern over memory/cognitive decline. The most common chronic
conditions were osteoarthritis (73%), hypertension (42%), hyperlip-
idemia (30%), osteoporosis (21%), diabetes (11%), and coronary artery
disease (6%).
Primary Outcomes
Global cognition: ADAS-Cog
Primary outcomes (ADAS-Cog and BAYER-ADL) are reported in
Tables 1 and 2. Resistance training signiﬁcantly improved ADAS-Cog
compared with sham exercise (P < .05) over 6 months, with a trend
for beneﬁt persistent over 18 months (P ¼ .08). The proportion of
participants with normal ADAS-Cog scores after resistance training
doubled from 24% to 48% (absolute increase of 24%), compared with
an increase from 20% to 27% (absolute increase of 7%) with sham
exercise [P < .03; adjusted odds ratio (OR; 95% conﬁdence intervals)
3.50; (1.18, 10.48)]; Figure 2. By contrast, there was no difference
between CT and sham cognitive (absolute increase of 19% vs 13%,
respectively) in the proportion with normal ADAS-Cog scores after
training [P > .99; adjusted OR 1.00 (0.34, 2.90].
Functional independence: BAYER-ADL
Functional impairment was minimal at baseline (consistent with
MCI criteria) and improved slightly over time (P < .001), as shown in
Tables 1 and 2, without group effects.
Secondary Cognitive Outcomes
Secondary outcomes are presented in Tables 1 and 2.
Executive Function
Resistance training signiﬁcantly improved executive function test
WAIS Matrices (P < .02) with trend for improvement in overall
Executive Domain score as well (P < .07), both over 18 months
(Tables 1 and 2). By contrast, there was no signiﬁcant effect of CT on
Executive Domain.
Contrary to our hypothesis, the Combined Group did not perform
better than the single intervention arms. Instead, there was a sig-
niﬁcant RESISTANCE  COGNITIVE  TIME interaction term in the
mixed models for both Category Fluency (Animal Naming; P < .02 and
P ¼ .003 over 6 and 18 months, respectively), as well as for overall
Executive Domain (P ¼ .01 and <.02 over 6 and 18 months, respec-
tively), see Tables 1 and 2. This interaction was due to the PRT Group
improving 60% more than the Combined Group on Executive Domain
changes at 6 months [mean z-score change of 0.426 (0.249, 0.603) vs
0.168 (0.026, 0.310), respectively, P < .03]. The Executive Domain
difference between PRT Group [mean z-score change 0.424 (0.215,
0.632)] and the Combined Group [mean z-score change 0.109
(0.060, 0.278)] was even greater at 18 months, with the PRT beneﬁt
74% higher than the Combined Group (P ¼ .02), (Figure 3a).
Memory
The effects of resistance training on memory were mixed. Resis-
tance training attenuated the decline in visual/constructional mem-
ory (BVRT-R; P ¼ .04) but was associated with worse delayed auditory
memory at 6 months (P < .03) and had no signiﬁcant effect on
Memory Domain score; see Tables 1 and 2. On the other hand, CT did
not signiﬁcantly improve any individual memory test, but maintained
the Memory Domain z-score (þ0.036) compared with z-score de-
clines without CT (0.196) at 6 months [z-score mean difference 0.23
(0.06, 0.52); P ¼ .01].
Speed/Attention
All participants improved slightly but signiﬁcantly over time,
without group effects (Tables 1 and 2).
Global Function Domain
There was a very small but signiﬁcant improvement in Global
Domain in the whole cohort over 6 months, with no group
differences [mean z-score change 0.119 (0.055, 0.183); P < .001,
Tables 1 and 2]. Similar to the ﬁndings for both Category Fluency and
Executive Domain above, there was a trend for an interaction of
RESISTANCE  COGNITIVE  TIME over 18 months (P < .07). As
shown in Figure 3b, this was due to the PRT Group having a 48%
higher beneﬁt [mean z-score change 0.452 (0.291, 0.614)] compared
with the Combined Group [mean z-score change 0.233 (0.103, 0.363)]
on Global Domain changes at 18 months (P < .04).

treatment groups in a fully factorial design so that all participants received either
active or sham cognitive intervention plus either active or sham exercise intervention.

Discussion
We have reported the primary outcomes of SMART, the ﬁrst fully
factorial trial of high intensity PRT and computerized multidomain CT
in older adults with MCI. As hypothesized, PRT signiﬁcantly improved
measures of global and executive function after training, as well as at
18-month follow-up. CT did not improve any individual test result at
either time point, but transientlyattenuated decline in overall Memory
Domain score at 6 months. Contrary to our hypotheses, the training
and long-term beneﬁts of PRT alone were signiﬁcantly greater for both
global and executive function compared with PRT combined with CT.
Efﬁcacy of Resistance Training
The clinical relevance of the signiﬁcant improvement in our pri-
mary outcome of global function (ADAS-Cog) with PRT is supported

Data represent the estimated marginal means and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) from repeated measures linear mixed models including all 3 time points, with ﬁxed effects of
time, resistance, cognitive, and their interactions, and adjusted for age, sex, and highest level of education.
Domain results are calculated as the average of the z-scores of the component tests.
Z-score at baseline ¼ individual value at baseline minus mean value for baseline cohort/SD for baseline cohort.
Z-score at 6 and 18 months ¼ individual value at 6 or 18 months minus mean value for baseline cohort/SD for baseline cohort.
Memory Domain was calculated by averaging the z-scores of component memory tests: ADAS-Cog List Learning Memory Sum, Logical Memory I (immediate), Logical Memory
II (delayed), and BVRT.
Executive Domain was calculated by averaging the z-scores of component executive function tests: WAIS-III Similarities, WAIS-III Matrices, COWAT, and Category Fluency.
Global cognition Domain was calculated by averaging the z-scores of all tests except ADAS-Cog Memory Sum, as this is a subscale within the ADAS-Cog and, therefore, already
included. The sign was reversed on the ADAS-Cog z-score so that positive z-score changes indicate improvement for all tests and Domains.
*Lower score indicates better function; n ¼ number of errors (ADAS-Cog20) or magnitude of deﬁcits in function reported by informant (BAYER-ADL21). For all other tests,
higher score indicates better function, n ¼ number correct.

WAIS ¼ Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale; N ¼ 100 for all outcomes.
All data were normally distributed and raw data used in analyses except for BAYER-ADL, which was logged.
Domain scores represent the average of the z-scores of each component test.
Z-score at baseline ¼ individual value at baseline minus mean value for baseline cohort/SD for baseline cohort.
Z-score at 6 and 18 months ¼ individual value at 6 or 18 months minus mean value for baseline cohort/SD for baseline cohort.
Memory Domain was calculated by averaging the z-scores of component memory tests: ADAS-Cog List Learning Memory Sum, Logical Memory I (Immediate), Logical Memory
II (Delayed), and BVRT.
Executive Domain was calculated by averaging the z-scores of component executive function tests: WAIS-III Similarities, WAIS-III Matrices, COWAT, and Category Fluency.
Global Cognition Domain was calculated by averaging the z-scores of all tests except ADAS-cog Memory Sum, as this is a subscale within the ADAS-Cog and, therefore, already
included. The sign was reversed on the ADAS-Cog z-score so that positive z-score changes indicate improvement for all tests and domains.
Two separate repeated measures linear mixed models were constructed for each cognitive outcome (dependent variable).
Intervention ﬁxed effects in mixed models were:
RESISTANCE ¼ PRT and combined groups vs no resistance training (CT and control groups)
COGNITIVE ¼ CT and combined groups vs no cognitive training (PRT and control groups)
The ﬁrst model included baseline and 6-month data (Treatment Effect). The second model included baseline, 6- and 18-month data (Long-term Effect). All models were
adjusted for age, sex and highest educational level achieved and included main effects of TIME, RESISTANCE, COGNITIVE, and the interaction terms: RESISTANCE  TIME,
COGNITIVE  TIME, AND RESISTANCE  COGNITIVE  TIME.
P values are from the mixed model Type III Sum of Squares tests of these ﬁxed effects.
Relative Hedges’ Bias Corrected Effect Sizes (ES) and 95% CI40 were calculated for each time point and main treatment effects for each cognitive outcome using the estimated
marginal means and standard deviations (SD) from the mixed models:
Relative effect size (ES) ¼ (post-test minus Baseline) INTERVENTION e (Post-test minus Baseline) NO INTERVENTION/pooled baseline SD of cohort.
For the domain ESs, which are already standardized z-scores, the formula was:
Relative ES ¼ post-test domain z-score minus baseline z-score (95% CIs).
*Lower score indicates better function, n ¼ number of errors on the ADAS-Cog20 or magnitude of deﬁcits in function by informant on the BAYER-ADL scale.21 For all other
tests, higher score indicates better function, n ¼ number correct.

by the observed doubling of the number of individuals scoring within
the normal range of ADAS-Cog (absolute increase from 24% to 48% of
participants), as well as by the persistence of beneﬁt for executive and
global function even 12 months after cessation of supervised training.
Prior systematic reviews and meta-analyses of exercise and
cognition have mainly focused on aerobic exercise and linked it most
closely to improved executive function in healthy older adults.10,26,27
By contrast, in our recent review of RCTs speciﬁc to individuals with
MCI,11 the beneﬁt of aerobic exercise was limited to verbal ﬂuency (no
other executive function), and did not beneﬁt memory in any
trial.18,28e31 Furthermore, the 2 trials of isolated moderate-high in-
tensity resistance training resulted in large signiﬁcant effects on
memory,17,18 whereas the effect of lower intensity resistance training
combined with other exercise modalities was inconclusive.32e35
These prior systematic reviews, along with the current SMART ﬁnd-
ings of signiﬁcantly improved global function, executive function, and
verbal/constructive memory in MCI after PRT provide evidence of the
utility of this speciﬁc exercise modality at high intensity to address
cognitive decline in this cohort.
Efﬁcacy of CT
CT prevented objective memory decline during the intervention
period only, suggesting that the beneﬁts from CT in this cohort are
contingent upon sustained training. Very few RCTs of multidomain CT
such as used in SMART have been reported in individuals with MCI12 or
cognitive complaints,36 and the results are mixed, with most effect
sizes being negligible or small. Thus, our ﬁndings and review of the
literature suggest that there is currently no evidence-based CT training
paradigm to recommend for global cognitive improvement in MCI.
Combined PRT and CT
Contrary to our hypothesis, the Combined Training Group,
receiving
full
doses
of
each
active
intervention,
performed
signiﬁcantly worse compared with isolated PRT on Executive and
Global Domains; differences which were sustained at 18 months. This
paradoxical negative effect of combined physical and CT we observed
stands in contrast to large beneﬁcial effects reported in two previous
small studies of combined physical/CT in healthy cohorts,37,38 as well
as to the neutral effect seen in the recent Mental Activity and eXercise
(MAX)36 trial in older adults with cognitive complaints.
The mechanism of this signiﬁcant blunting of PRT beneﬁt when CT
was added is not known. The combined intervention, which was both
mentally and physically challenging, could have resulted in excessive
stress, less engagement in home or community-based activities, or
other changes that inhibited rather than promoted neural plasticity
and cognitive beneﬁts. Concurrent aerobic and resistive exercise has
been shown to negatively impact anabolic adaptations to isolated PRT
such as strength gain, thought to be due to interference at the mo-
lecular level.39 It is possible that a similar interference with neural/
cognitive adaptations to PRT could occur with concurrent CT, a novel
hypothesis warranting further investigation.
Conclusions
We have shown for the ﬁrst time that 6 months of high intensity
PRT improved the primary outcome of global cognition, as well as
executive function and verbal/constructional memory in older adults
Fig. 2. Proportion of participants with ADAS-Cog total score within normal range at
baseline and after 6 months of training. *Resistance training was associated with a
signiﬁcantly increased proportion of participants with normal ADAS-Cog scores
(increasing from 24% at baseline to 48% after training compared with 20% to 27% in the
nonresistance training participants: adjusted OR (95% CIs) ¼ 3.50 (1.18, 10.48), P < .03).
By contrast, there was no signiﬁcant effect of CT on ADAS-Cog status at 6 months
(increasing from 29% to 48% normal) compared with noncognitive training participants
(increasing from 14% to 27% normal; OR 1.00 (0.34, 2.95; P > .99).

with MCI, with some maintenance of global and executive function
beneﬁt 12 months after cessation of training. By contrast, CT had no
signiﬁcant effects on global function, individual tests, or any Cognitive
Domains other than memory, and it attenuated Memory Domain
decline during the period of active training only. Combined Training
unexpectedly signiﬁcantly reduced the beneﬁts of isolated PRT on
executive and global function. Further large-scale trials are warranted
to conﬁrm and extend our ﬁndings, explore the mechanism of
cognitive/neural adaptations to PRT, and most critically to demon-
strate that PRT can reduce incident dementia in this high-risk cohort.
