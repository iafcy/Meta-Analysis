Objective: This study was designed to extend the use of a memory training technique, known as the
repetition-lag procedure, to Alzheimer patients. The speciﬁcity of this procedure is to target the process
of recollection for improvement.
Method: A group of 12 patients were trained individually for 6 h. The training procedure consisted of a
series of yes/no recognition tasks in which some words were repeated throughout the test list across
gradually increasing delays. Their performance was evaluated on pre-and-post tests and compared with
a recognition practice group and a no contact control group.
Results: Initially, recollection training patients only performed accurately when the delay between
repetitions consisted of one intervening word, but by the end of training their performance increased
up to four-word intervals. Interestingly, these beneﬁts generalized to other measures of memory, such
as working memory, visual memory and source recognition.
Conclusions: Effectiveness of the repetition-lag procedure in Alzheimer’s disease is discussed.

1. Introduction
Memory disorders are the earliest and most frequent deﬁcits
associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Collette, Van der Linden,
Juillerat, & Meulemans, 2003; Hodges, 2000), and they have impor-
tant implications for the patients and their caregivers. Despite the
severity of memory impairments and the presence of other cogni-
tive deﬁcits affecting executive functions and attention early in the
disease, many studies that have developed memory intervention
programs have shown that some beneﬁts can be obtained in mild
AD. The major intervention approaches have focused on encoding
and retrieval strategy learning, multimodal intervention and
process-based training (e.g. Balota, Duchek, Sergent-Marshall, &
Roediger, 2006; Clare & Woods, 2004; Loewenstein, Acevedo,
Czaja, & Duara, 2004). The outcomes of strategy learning methods
show generally positive effects on the trained task, but evidence for
transfer of gains to other cognitive tasks or to real life performance
is limited. Multimodal approaches were developed as a response to
this issue by combining different learning strategies with psycho-
social interventions. Transfer effects from these programs have
been found on other lab tasks and ecological measures in normal
aging (e.g., Ball et al., 2002; Floyd & Scogin, 1997) and in AD (see
Clare & Woods, 2004, for a review) but it is usually unclear which
aspects of the interventions are responsible for the observed ben-
eﬁts. The third approach has been aimed at training speciﬁc mem-
ory processes. These programs are designed to train participants on
tasks that are thought to target speciﬁc memory processes and
allow one to assess transfer of gains to different untrained tasks
which are thought to involve the same processes. A few studies
have shown evidence of transfer beneﬁts from process-based train-
ing in normal young and older adults (e.g. Ball et al., 2002;
Jennings, Webster, Kleykamp, & Dagenbach, 2005; Karbach & Kray,
2009; Persson & Reuter-Lorenz, 2008). In particular, one promising
process-based training approach is the repetition-lag procedure
which is considered to improve a general skill involved in recol-
lecting speciﬁc information such as source, recency and output
details (Jennings & Jacoby, 2003). This training procedure is based
on the dual process theory, which draws a distinction between
automatic
(familiarity)
and
controlled
(recollection)
memory
processes (Jacoby & Dallas, 1981; Mandler, 1980). Controlled pro-
cesses are characterized by the intentional retrieval of a previously
learned item and its temporo-spatial context. In contrast, familiar-
ity refers to the automatic inﬂuences that lead to recognition of an
item previously encountered without contextual details of the
learning phase (e.g. Hasher & Zacks, 1979; Posner & Snyder,
1975; Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977).

In the repetition-lag procedure, participants are given a series of
continuous recognition tasks. They have to study a list of words
and then recognize them among new words. A key feature of this
procedure is the repetition of new words during the recognition
phase. Each new word is presented twice throughout the recogni-
tion phase following pre-determined intervals. Participants are
asked to respond ‘‘yes’’ to studied words and ‘‘no’’ to new words
even if they have already encountered those new words during
the task. This approach, known as the opposition procedure, was
developed to separate the respective contribution of recollection
and familiarity in the same task. The ﬁrst presentation of new
words during the recognition task is supposed to increase their
familiarity, and participants can misattribute this familiarity to
the prior study phase, confuse repeated words with studied words,
and mistakenly respond ‘‘yes’’. However, if participants are able to
recollect the source of a repeated word’s presentation, then any
inﬂuence of familiarity will be removed and they will correctly
respond ‘‘no’’ (e.g. Jacoby, Yonelinas, & Jennings, 1997; Jennings
& Jacoby, 1993, 1997; Yonelinas, 2002). A second important feature
of the repetition-lag procedure is the gradual increase of the lag
intervals across training sessions as performance improves. The
number of intervening words between the ﬁrst and the second pre-
sentation of repeated words are modulated by the level of perfor-
mance success. This incremented-difﬁculty aspect of the training
technique was designed to improve recollection by extending what
participants do to successfully recollect information at a short
interval so that it is applied at longer delays (Jennings & Jacoby,
2003; Jennings et al., 2005).
As mentioned, the repetition-lag training technique was based
on the opposition procedure or exclusion task, which is part of
the larger process dissociation procedure (Jacoby, 1991; Jacoby,
Toth, & Yonelinas, 1993; Jacoby et al., 1997; Jennings & Jacoby,
1993, 1997; Yonelinas, 2002). Jacoby (1991, 1998) developed the
process-dissociation procedure (PDP) in order to separate and
quantify the contributions of controlled and automatic processes
to performance in a single memory task and it has been used in
several studies to examine changes in memory processes in normal
aging and in AD. Results have shown that normal aging affects con-
sciously controlled memory processing but spares automatic
memory processes (Anderson et al., 2008; Hay & Jacoby, 1999;
Jennings & Jacoby, 1993, 1997; Titov & Knight, 1997). This dissoci-
ation is even more marked in Alzheimer’s disease which has been
characterized by an early impairment of controlled processes
(Adam, Van der Linden, Collette, & Salmon, 2005; Knight, 1998;
Koivisto, Portin, Seinelä, & Rinne, 1998; Smith & Knight, 2002)
and an initial preservation of automatic processes (Adam et al.,
2005; Koivisto et al., 1998). In addition, the same pattern of results
has been highlighted in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive
impairment (aMCI), a stage considered to be transitional between
healthy aging and AD (Anderson et al., 2008).
In view of these ﬁndings, use of the repetition-lag procedure to
target consciously controlled processing for improvement in nor-
mal aging, MCI and AD would appear to be a beneﬁcial approach.
Thus far, results of this training have shown that memory perfor-
mance can be improved in cognitively healthy older adults
(Jennings & Jacoby, 2003). In that work, initially, participants could
only accurately identify repeated items when the delay between
repetitions consisted of two intervening words, but by the end of
6 h of training, they could perform accurately at 28 word-intervals.
Moreover, post-training gains following recollection training were
found on measures of working memory, memory monitoring, pro-
cessing speed and long term memory in both cognitively healthy
older adults (Jennings et al., 2005) and in individuals with MCI
(Jennings et al., 2006).
The current study was designed to extend the use of the repeti-
tion-lag procedure to patients with mild AD. Our assumption is that
this training procedure could improve the ability to recollect speciﬁc
information in AD. Even if controlled processes are impaired in this
disease, they are not completely non-functional, especially at early
stages and might be enhanced by this procedure. Improvements in
AD patients were expected on the training task itself and on other
memory measures as has been demonstrated in normal aging and
individuals with MCI (Jennings & Jacoby, 2003; Jennings et al.,
2005, 2006). Our ﬁrst objective then was to verify whether AD
patients can improve their performance on the training task if it is
adapted to the speciﬁcities of their cognitive deﬁcits. Our second
objective was to examine whether gains on transfer tasks can be
observed if AD patients show improvement on the training task
itself. For that purpose pre-and-post training tests were adminis-
tered to a recollection training group and to two control groups (rec-
ognition practice and no contact). These tests consisted of tasks
assessing working memory (n-back and reading span) and episodic
memory (recall, item-recognition memory and source-recognition
memory) in verbal and visual modalities and were chosen for their
abilities to target the same processes as those involved in the train-
ing task. The n-back and reading span tasks were selected because
they involve controlled working memory processes, respectively
updating and attentional control processes; the recall and recogni-
tion tasks were selected because they involve both recollection
and familiarity. As the goal of repetition-lag procedure is to improve
the ability to recollect information across increasing delay intervals,
we hypothesized that the training procedure would beneﬁt these
working and episodic memory measures. No improvement is
expected in both recognition practice and no contact groups on
any of the transfer tasks.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Thirty-six community-dwelling patients with AD volunteered to
take part in the current study and were recruited from the Geriatric
Center of Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. The diagnosis of dementia was
based on general medical, neurological, and neuropsychological
examinations according to the National Institute of Neurological
and Communication Disorders–Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Disorders
Association
(NINCDS–ADRDA)
criteria
for
probable
Alzheimer’s disease (McKhann et al., 1984) and the DSM IV clinical
criteria for dementia of the Alzheimer type (American Psychiatric
Association, 1994). Patients were included if the severity of AD
was mild or mild-to-moderate as indicated by a score of 19 or above
on the Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE, Folstein, Folstein, &
McHugh, 1975). Patients were excluded if they had a history of clin-
ically signiﬁcant depression, alcohol or drug use, other neurological
disease, traumatic brain damage or if French was not their primary
language. The 36 patients were randomly divided into three groups
– an experimental recollection training group, a control recognition
practice group and a no contact group. Each group consisted of eight
females and four males except for the no contact group (seven
females and ﬁve males). The demographic and neuropsychological
characteristics of all patients are presented in Table 1. The clinical
assessment included the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) for docu-
mentation of depressive symptoms (Yesavage et al., 1983). The
MMSE and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS; Mattis,
1973) were used to assess global functioning and dementia sever-
ity. The neuropsychological battery included measures of memory
(digit span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III;
Wechsler, 1997), language (verbal ﬂuency; Cardébat, Doyon, Puel,
Goulet, & Joanette, 1990; DO80 picture naming test; Deloche &
Hannequin, 1997), and executive functions (Trail Making Test A
and B; Adjutant General’s Ofﬁce, 1944). No signiﬁcant differences
170

were found in age, years of education, cognitive global functioning
or neuropsychological assessments between the three groups.
2.2. Materials
2.2.1. Training tasks
The two different training tasks both consisted of verbal yes/no
recognition tasks. The words were written in French and presented
one at a time in the center of a laptop computer screen for 3 s fol-
lowed by a 1 s white screen. Each training session consisted of a
study phase with 16 words to learn and a test phase where the
study words were mixed with 36 other words.
2.2.1.1. Recollection training. This training was adapted from the
repetition-lag
procedure
developed
by
Jennings
and
Jacoby
(2003). Seven hundred and sixty-eight concrete nouns chosen from
Bonin’s database were randomly divided into 48 sets of 16 words
(Bonin et al., 2003). These lists were matched for frequency of
occurrence in the language. Twenty-four lists were used as study
items for the training sessions. The remaining lists were used as
distractor items for the recognition phase. Patients were given four
training sessions a day, 3 days per week for 2 weeks. Each training
session consisted of a study and a test phase, which is illustrated in
Fig. 1. During the study phase, patients were asked to read the
words aloud and remember them. In the test phase, patients were
shown the 16 study words and 16 new words with the 16 new
words repeated at one of two different lags (number of intervening
items between the ﬁrst and second presentation of a repeated
word). The task was to recognize the words they had read aloud
from the study phase (i.e., responding yes to study words and no
to new items even when they were repeated). The experimenters
gave positive feedback only when patients responded correctly.
The test phase was not limited by time, and each of the four ses-
sions required about 7–10 min.
The incrementing procedure was implemented by gradually
increasing the lag intervals according to the patient’s level of suc-
cess. The criterion for success was set to a maximum of two errors
in identifying the repeated words. Speciﬁcally, in the ﬁrst session,
the 16 new words were repeated after two different lag intervals: 8
words after 1 intervening word (lag 1) and 8 words after 2 inter-
vening words (lag 2). The lag interval pairs used for training con-
sisted of 1 and 2; 1 and 3; 2 and 4; 2 and 8 and 4 and 12. These
pairs were chosen so that patients were always working at one
lag interval they had already mastered and a second interval that
was new and more difﬁcult. If participants did not achieve criterion
at both lags, they continued to work at those intervals for as many
sessions as needed to meet criterion. Once criterion was reached
the lag intervals increased in the order listed above. Gains in per-
formance were measured by comparing the length of interval at
which patients reached criterion by the end of session 3 on the ﬁrst
day of training with the longest lag interval reached by the end of
the 6-day procedure. Sessions 1 and 2 on the ﬁrst training day were
considered as a required practice to allow patients to become
familiar with the mechanics of the procedure.
2.2.1.2. Recognition practice. This procedure was adapted from a
cognitive training control condition judged to be comparable in
time, effort, and social stimulation to the repetition-lag technique
(Jennings et al., 2005). One thousand, one hundred and ﬁfty-two
concrete nouns chosen from the Brulex database (Content, Mousty,

& Radeau, 1990) were randomly divided into 72 sets of 16 words.
These sets were matched for frequency of occurrence in the lan-
guage. They were then organized into 24 study and 48 test lists.
As in the recollection training group, patients were given four
training sessions a day, 3 days per week for 2 weeks. In each ses-
sion, they were asked to read the 16 words aloud and learn them
for the recognition test that would follow. During the test phase
they had to recognize the 16 study words which were mixed with
32 new words. Experimenters gave positive feedback to the pa-
tients only when they responded correctly. The test phase was
not limited by time, and each of the four sessions required about
7–10 min.
2.2.2. Transfer tasks
2.2.2.1. n-Back task. This task is a modiﬁed version of the paramet-
ric n-back task (Jennings et al., 2005; Jonides et al., 1997) devel-
oped by Dobbs and Rule (1989). The consonants ‘‘b, d, f, g, h, j,
m, n, q, r, and t’’ acted as stimuli and were presented in upper or
lowercase. Each letter was presented for 2 s in the center of a lap-
top computer screen and followed by a 1 s blank screen. Patients
were shown a sequence of letters, and for each one they had to
decide whether it matched the identity of the letter that had
preceded it by n places in the sequence. The task started with
the 1-back sequence, followed by the 2-back sequence and then
the 3-back sequence. A sequence was composed of 35 trials in
which only 10 trials were used to evaluate performance. These
10 critical trials corresponded to 7 trials in which the letters
matched the n-back position and 3 trials in which the letters
matched near the n-back position (for the 1-back condition, 2 trials
occurred in the 2-back position and 1 trial in the 3-back position;
for 2-back, 2 trials occurred in the 1-back position and 1 trial in the
3-back position; for 3-back, 2 trials occurred in the 1-back position
and 1 trial in the 2-back position). Twenty-ﬁve no-matched trials
completed the sequence. In these no-matched trials, letters were
spaced between an identical letter by at least eight trials. Prior to
starting each n-back level, a practice sequence was carried out to
ensure the instructions were understood.
2.2.2.2. Reading span task. Patients were given a French version of
the reading span task (Desmette, Hupet, Schelstraete, & Van der
Linden, 1995) adapted from Daneman and Carpenter’s task
(1980). Sixty-two sentences were presented one at time on a lap-
top computer screen. Participants had to read aloud lists of sen-
tences and memorize the ﬁnal word of each one. The number of
sentences in a passage increased from one to six with three trials
at each series length. The target measure was the highest span cor-
rectly recalled for two out of three trials. Prior to starting the task, a
practice trial of two sentences was conducted to ensure the
instructions were clear.
2.2.2.3. RL/RI 16: Free and cued recall task. This episodic memory
task is a French version of a visual verbal learning test (Van der Lin-
den, Coyette, Poitrenaud. & GREMEM, 2004) adapted from Grober
and Buschke’s procedure (1987) to assess episodic memory. This
test consisted of 16 to-be-learned words with an immediate cued
recall test in order to control encoding, three free recall tests, each
immediately followed by cued recall for items not retrieved at free
recall, a yes–no recognition task and a 20 min delay free and cued
recall test. The study words belong to different semantic catego-
ries, which are used as cues.
2.2.2.4. DMS 48: Delayed matching-to-sample task. This task is a
visual forced-choice
recognition memory task
adapted from
Barbeau, Didic, et al. (2004) and Barbeau, Tramoni, et al. (2004).
Stimuli consisted of colored drawings of abstract patterns and con-
crete objects. During the encoding phase, patients were asked to
consecutively look at 48 pictures presented at a 3 s rate on a laptop
computer screen, and to remember them. The study phase was fol-
lowed by a counting backward interference task lasting 20 s. For
the recognition task each of the 48 targets was presented simulta-
neously with a distractor and the patients were asked to identify
the target.
2.2.2.5. Source recognition task. Sixty pictures were selected from
Snodgrass and Vanderwart’s norms (1980). The materials consisted
of the sixty pictures, with an average level of visual complexity
(2.59 ± .67), and their corresponding names. For the study phase,
a set of 30 stimuli was constructed consisting of 15 words and
15 pictures. The 30 targets and 30 new stimuli were used for the
recognition task in both their picture and their word format. Dur-
ing the study phase the stimuli were presented successively one at
a time in random order via a laptop computer at a 3 s rate. Patients
were asked to try to remember them for a later memory test. After
a 20 s counting backward interference task, a series of 30 stimulus
cards was presented. Each one contained a target word and its pic-
torial representation plus a distractor word and its pictorial repre-
sentation. Patients were required to identify the target and indicate
whether it was originally presented as a word or a picture.
2.3. Procedure
Patients were tested individually for the pre-and-post training
assessments and administered the training procedures in their
own homes except for six individuals (three from the recollection
training group and three from the recognition practice group)
who were assessed and trained in the geriatric center. The pre-
and-post training tests were administered the ﬁrst and the fourth
weeks in the same following order: (1) RL/RI 16: three trials of free
and cued recall, (2) RL/RI 16: recognition, (3) DMS 48, (4) n-back:
1-back, 2-back then 3-back, (5) RL/RI 16: delay free and cued recall,
(6) source recognition task, and (7) reading span task. Parallel
forms of the source recognition, DMS 48 and RL/RI 16 tasks were
used across the pre-and-post training sessions and counterbal-
anced across patients. The recollection training and recognition
practice procedures were administered 1 h a day, 3 days a week
for 2 weeks. During this period, the no contact group had no inter-
action with the experimenters.
3. Results
3.1. Training tasks
3.1.1. Recollection training
In order to assess the effectiveness of recollection training, the
interval length at which criterion was achieved between the ﬁrst
and last days of training were compared using a paired sample
t-test (see Fig. 2). Results showed a signiﬁcant improvement
between
the
ﬁrst
and
the
last
training
day,
t(11) = 6.77,
p < .001. On the ﬁrst day of training, patients reached criterion with
an average lag interval of 1.33 intervening items (SD = .49) but by
the last day of training, they were able to reach criterion with an
average of ﬁve intervening items (SD = 1.81).
To ensure that the improvements in performance obtained with
the repetition-lag procedure were due to recollection, analyses
examining changes in recognition performance and response bias
during the course of training were carried out. Recognition accu-
racy was determined by taking the average level of performance
across the four training lists for each training day and calculating
the difference between the probability of responding ‘‘yes’’ to
study items (hits) and new items on their ﬁrst presentation (false
alarms). These results are reported in Table 2. A one-way repeated
172
B. Boller et al. / Brain and Cognition 78 (2012) 169–177

measures ANOVA conducted with day as the variable of interest
found no signiﬁcant change in recognition accuracy, F(5,282) < 1,
replicating results obtained elsewhere (Jennings & Jacoby, 2003).
This ﬁnding suggests that patients’ improvements in identifying
repeated items across increasingly longer intervals was not simply
an artifact arising from general practice effects but was instead
speciﬁc to changes in processes associated with recollection.
As mentioned, an analysis of response bias was also conducted
as patients may have noticed across training that there were twice
as many ‘‘no’’ responses as ‘‘yes’’ responses per trial (16 new items
and 16 repeated items of 48 stimuli) and adapted their responses
accordingly. Response bias was determined by calculating the
index C (Macmillan & Creelman, 2005; Snodgrass & Corwin,
1988), which locates the bias criterion relative to the intersection
of old and new distributions, from the hits and false alarm data
described above. A value of 0 for C indicates a neutral response
bias, a positive value indicates a conservative response bias and a
negative value indicates a liberal response bias. C estimates are
reported in Table 2. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was
conducted with day as the independent variable and showed no
signiﬁcant change in response bias across the days, F(5,282) < 1.
3.1.2. Recognition practice
In order to evaluate whether patients showed any gains in the
recognition training task, performance was established by calculat-
ing the average level of accuracy across the four training lists for
each training day. Accuracy level was determined by the difference
between the probability of responding ‘‘yes’’ to study items (hits)
and new items (false alarms). Results are reported in Table 3. A
one-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted with day as
the variable of interest. The results showed no signiﬁcant change
in recognition accuracy across the days, F(5,282) < 1.
3.2. Transfer tasks
In order to assess the effects of training on the transfer tasks, a
multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was ﬁrst conducted
on the pre-training test scores to ensure that the performance of
the three groups were statistically equivalent before training. The
results showed no signiﬁcant effect of group, Wilks’ F(22,46) < 1.
Then, a 3 (group)  2 (test time) mixed factor MANOVA was car-
ried out on the pre and post training tests for the three groups to
examine the effectiveness of the repetition-lag procedure. As ex-
pected, there was no main effect of group, Wilks’ F(22,46) = 1.50,
ns, but a signiﬁcant group  test interaction, Wilks’ F(22,46) =
1.96, p = .03, and a signiﬁcant main effect of test session, Wilks’
F(11,23) = 235.08, p < .001, were found. Finally, a series of 3
(group)  2 (test time) mixed factor ANOVAs was carried out for
each pre and post training test for all three groups; no signiﬁcant
group effect was found for any of the transfer measures (all
F’s < 2.22, all p’s > .12). Each signiﬁcant interaction was followed
by paired sample t-tests comparing pre-and-post training perfor-
mance within each group. Test main effects and group  test time
interactions are described below: all results are summarized in
Table 4.
3.2.1. n-Back task
The n-back performance was determined by the difference
between the n-back matched trials correctly identiﬁed (hits) and
the near n-back matched trials incorrectly identiﬁed as matched
(false alarms). Results from the 1-back and 3-back tasks showed
no signiﬁcant group  test interaction, respectively F(2,33) = 0.12,
p = .89 and F(2,33) = 0.69, p = .51. In contrast, a signiﬁcant group
by test interaction was found for the 2-back task, F(2,33) = 4.24,
p = .02, g2
p = .20. The recollection training group improved signiﬁ-
cantly on the post training test of 2-back task performance,

t(11) = 4.10, p = .002, whereas no improvements were found in the
other two groups (t’s 6 .92, p’s P .37).
3.2.2. Reading span task
There was no signiﬁcant test effect, F(1,33) < 1 nor signiﬁcant
group  test interaction, F(2,33) < 1 for the reading span task.
Performance appears unaffected by the training procedure.
3.2.3. RL/RI 16 free and cued recall task
No signiﬁcant test effects or signiﬁcant group  test interac-
tions were found on any of the immediate free recall and cued
recall tasks, or delayed free and cued recall tests, respectively all
F(1,33) < 1 and all F(2,33) < 1. In contrast, a signiﬁcant test effect,
F(1,33) = 1.50, p = .012, g2
p = .31 and a signiﬁcant group  test
interaction, F(2,33) = 14.87, p < .001, g2
p = .23 were found on the
recognition subtest. Subsequent analyses performed with paired
sample t-tests revealed a signiﬁcant gain in performance for both
the recollection training and recognition practice groups, respec-
tively t(11) = 2.59, p = .03 and t(11) = 4.02, p = .002, which was
not seen in the no contact group, t(11) = .56, p = .586.
3.2.4. DMS 48 task
The DMS 48 measure was determined by computing the
number of correctly recognized items. The 3 (group)  2 (test time)
ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant group  test interaction, F(2,33) =
11.14, p < .001, g2
p = .40. Paired sample t-tests showed that only
the recollection training group signiﬁcantly improved performance
at post test, t(11) = 4.85, p < .001, whereas the other two groups did
not (t’s 6 1.24, p’s P .24).
3.2.5. Source recognition task
The source recognition measure was determined by computing
the number of items correctly recognized in the format presented
during the study phase and a signiﬁcant group  test interaction
was found, F(2,33) = 10.09; p < .001, g2
p = .38. Paired sample t-tests
showed that only the recollection training group’s performance
improved signiﬁcantly on the post test, t(11) = 4.05, p = .002,
whereas the performance of the other two groups did not change
(t’s 6 1.83, p’s P .09).
4. Discussion
The results of the present study are remarkable in two ways: (1)
they are the ﬁrst to show that the repetition-lag procedure has a
beneﬁcial effect on recollection memory in AD patients and (2) this
effect is transferable to other memory tasks as has been evidenced
in normal aging and in MCI individuals (Jennings & Jacoby, 2003;
Jennings et al., 2005, 2006). At the beginning of training, patients
from the recollection training group were able to identify accu-
rately a repeated word only when an average of 1 intervening word
occurred between the ﬁrst and second presentation of the repeated
word. However, after six 1-h training sessions, patients were able
to reach criterion after a delay of 4–8 intervening words. At
the same time, recognition performance measured as the differ-
ence between hits (‘‘yes’’ responses to studied items) and false
alarms (‘‘yes’’ responses to unstudied words on their ﬁrst presenta-
tion) was not improved by the training. This result suggests that
effectiveness of the repetition-lag procedure does not lie with a
general practice effect but is more speciﬁc to the form of memory
necessary to identify repeated occurrences of a previously pre-
sented word. An alternative explanation for such improvement
could involve a preserved metamemorial ability in AD patients that
allowed them to shift their response bias (Waring, Chong, Wolk, &
Budson, 2008) to increasingly respond ‘‘no’’ to all test items thus
rejecting repeated items with greater frequency. However, as no
change was observed on response bias across training, increases
in conservative responding could not explain why only memory
for unstudied repeated words was improved.
Our analysis of response bias did yield one somewhat unex-
pected result for the recollection training group on the repeti-
tion-lag training task. Speciﬁcally, a conservative response bias
(values of C greater than 0) was shown by the group. Although it
is widely acknowledged that AD patients show a more liberal
response bias compared with healthy older adults (see Budson,
Wolk, Chong, & Waring, 2006, for a review). This result may have
occurred because of the design characteristics of the repetition-
lag procedure such that the training experimental recognition
tasks differed in some points from the ones traditionally used to
evaluate response bias in this population. In particular, the number
of studied words was shorter; the presentation time of each stud-
ied words was longer and there were no interfering tasks between
the study and test phases. Nonetheless, when compared to cogni-
tively healthy older adults administered the repetition-lag proce-
dure (see Jennings & Jacoby, 2003), the AD patients’ response
bias is markedly less conservative, which seems somewhat consis-
tent with other ﬁndings (e.g. Budson et al., 2006).
The repetition-lag procedure seems to draw its efﬁcacy from
two key features: one is the opposition procedure which targets
recollection in order to correctly identify repeated items. The sec-
ond is the incremented-difﬁculty approach that allows one to
enhance the ability to recollect information across increasing delay
intervals. Indeed, as the number and the length of training sessions
were similar in both the recollection training and recognition

practice groups, the observed improvements seem to be linked to
the nature of the repetition-lag task which both requires recollec-
tion and takes into account individual performance by gradually
increasing the lag intervals as performance improves. However,
theses gains were less marked than those reported in MCI individ-
uals (from 2 to 14 intervening words, Jennings et al., 2006) and in
older adults (2 to 28, Jennings & Jacoby, 2003; 2 to 18, Jennings
et al., 2005). Given a similar number of training sessions were used
as in all the studies above, these differences can be explained by
the greater level of recollection deterioration in AD than in the
MCI stage or in normal aging (e.g. Adam et al., 2005; Anderson
et al., 2008; Jennings & Jacoby, 1993), which may have necessitated
more training to achieve comparable gains as obtained in popula-
tions with better recollection. Nonetheless, the improvements seen
here are in line with our general assumption that even though con-
trolled processes are impaired in AD, a residual part of controlled
processing remains sufﬁciently functional to be enhanced by a
speciﬁc training focus.
Moreover, post training gains were found on other measures of
memory in the recollection training group. AD patients from this
group demonstrated signiﬁcantly greater post-training scores rela-
tive to pre-training for the visual recognition task (DMS 48), the
source recognition task, and the 2-back task, a working memory
task assessing the updating executive component of the central
executive. No signiﬁcant improvements were found on these tasks
in the recognition practice and the no contact control groups. Like-
wise, no signiﬁcant improvements were seen in any of the three
groups on the reading span, 1-back, 3-back nor the RL/RI 16 free
and cued recall tasks.
The improvements observed on the visual and source recogni-
tion tasks in the recollection training group may be linked to the
patients’ increased capacity to retrieve associative information
after repetition-lag training. According to Moscovitch’s model of
memory (1992), the content of memories includes individual
pieces of information (item memory), and links between those
pieces of information (associative memory). Dual-process models
of recognition provide a framework that takes into account this
distinction. Item memory can be supported by both recollection
and familiarity inﬂuences whereas associative memory seems to
be more recollection speciﬁc. Because associative memory is highly
reliant on recall-like processes at retrieval it seems that the aspects
of memory that are enhanced by the repetition-lag procedure are
the ones that involve associative memory. This hypothesis is in line
with the absence of any improvements in free recall on the RL/RI
16 task and on the reading span task which do not require associa-
tive memory for successful performance. However, this hypothesis
cannot explain the absence of any improvements in cued recall on
the RL/RI 16 task. Considering that the cued recall task requires
more cognitive resource than recognition, and that patients with
mild AD are more impaired in cued recall tasks than in recognition
tasks (Tounsi et al., 1999), one explanation could be that the trans-
fer effects are too subtle to be observed in cued recall tests. More-
over, cued recall involves also semantic memory, which is
precociously impaired in AD (Hodges & Patterson, 1995). A surpris-
ing result was found on the recognition measure of the RL/RI 16
free and cued recall task. The recollection training and the recogni-
tion practice groups both showed a signiﬁcant improvement after
training whereas the no-contact group did not. If the improvement
observed in the recollection training group can be attributed to the
effect of the repetition-lag procedure, the improvement observed
in the recognition practice group seems more likely linked to the
nature of that training task itself. Indeed, the recognition practice
training task’s demands were very close to those of the RL/RI 16’s
recognition test. Both consist of a verbal yes/no recognition task
and a task-speciﬁc effect from the recognition practice technique
is not difﬁcult to envisage.
As for the improvements observed on the 2-back task in the rec-
ollection training group these may reﬂect the enhancement of
updating processes. This hypothesis could explain the absence of
improvement on the reading span task which involves attentional
controlled processes rather than updating processes. Recollection
training with increasing lags could thus enhance performance in
the 2-back task because it taps the speciﬁc strategies required to
initiate a strategic retrieval search and check that information
has been correctly recalled. Recollection training may also contrib-
ute to the enhancement of temporal order memory, which is rele-
vant for successful 2-back performance. The absence of any
improvements on the 1-back and the 3-back levels compared to
the signiﬁcant improvements found on the 2-back level could be
attributed to ﬂoor and ceiling effects: The 1-back task was too easy
whereas the 3-back task was too difﬁcult for AD patients.
In summary, the effects on the working and episodic memory
tasks may be understood by the improvement of recollection. It
seems that the repetition-lag procedure does not improve a mem-
ory system per se but may enhance speciﬁc processes involved in
different memory systems. The gains found on the n-back, visual
recognition and source recognition tasks indicate that the repeti-
tion-lag procedure provides transfer effects on recognition tasks,
in both yes/no and forced choice modalities for different categories
of stimuli such as drawings, nouns or letters. These beneﬁts sug-
gest that this procedure is targeting recollection and may be an
effective method for promoting training and transfer in AD.
Nevertheless, all these results should be interpreted with cau-
tion because of the small sample size of the patients. Other studies
need to be conducted in order to replicate these ﬁndings in a more
representative group. Even though the recognition practice condi-
tion has been chosen because it was judged to be comparable with
recollection training in time, effort, and social stimulation, one pos-
sible interpretation could be that repetition-lag procedure is hard-
er than the recognition practice one. Thus, the beneﬁts would not
be speciﬁcally attributable to training with a lag procedure.
However, theses gains are in line with previous studies that
have shown effective cognitive training and successful transfer in
normal aging (Ball et al., 2002; Jennings et al., 2005) and provide
evidence that individualized cognitive training programs can pro-
duce transfer effects in AD. These transfer effects are even more
striking considering the paucity of evidence for successful training
and transfer effects from cognitive training programs that do not
rely on mnemonics or errorless learning techniques in AD patients
(for review see Clare & Woods, 2004).
It is now widely acknowledged that laboratory measures of rec-
ollection correlate strongly with the self-reported frequency of
everyday memory errors such as repeating oneself or forgetting if
medication has been already taken (Jacoby, Jennings, & Hay,
1996). The recollection training procedure may have a positive
effect on everyday memory functioning and should be an approach
for further such research.
Future research could also make use of functional neuroimaging
to determine whether the beneﬁts observed from the repetition-
lag procedure in AD patients are accompanied by changes in neural
activity. Data from neuroimaging have yielded evidence for the
compensation hypothesis of age-related hemispheric asymmetry
reductions which have been use to explain why high-performing
older adults can do as well as young adults on verbal recall and
source memory tasks (Cabeza, Anderson, Locantore, & McIntosh,
2002) suggesting these participants respond to the retrieval
demands of the memory task by recruiting bilateral prefrontal cor-
tex regions (PFC). This compensation hypothesis has also been
applied to high-performing MCI individuals. A bilateral PFC activa-
tion has been observed in these individuals on a verbal episodic
memory encoding task and could explain the absence of differ-
ences in performance relative to older control adults (Clément &
B. Boller et al. / Brain and Cognition 78 (2012) 169–177
175

Belleville, 2010). Moreover, other research has shown that recol-
lection relies on the PFC and is involved in several working and
long-term memory tasks (for review see Yonelinas, 2002) and neu-
ral correlates have been reported after training-related improve-
ment in normal aging (Nyberg et al., 2003) and in individuals
with MCI (Belleville et al., 2011). So, one assumption could be that
the repetition-lag procedure may produce changes in AD according
to the compensation hypothesis.
Alternative explanations for the training gains found here
should also be considered in future studies particularly in light of
data presented by Ally, Gold, and Budson (2009), who used a recei-
ver operating characteristics paradigm (ROC) to examine familiar-
ity and recollection in AD. They found recollection to be near 0 and
familiarity to be markedly impaired. Although the integrity of
familiarity appears to be a matter of dispute across the literature
with some work showing normal familiarity (Westerberg et al.,
2006), deﬁcits in recollection appear inarguable (Adam et al.,
2005; Knight, 1998; Koivisto et al., 1998; Smith & Knight, 2002).
It was for the latter reason that the repetition-lag procedure was
adapted to make use of study/test lists that were signiﬁcantly
shorter than those used elsewhere (e.g., Ally et al., 2009; Jennings
et al., 2005) in the hope that use of some residual capabilities asso-
ciated with recollection could be tapped by patients and facilitated.
Nonetheless, recollection estimates of 0 (Ally et al., 2009) raise the
question as to whether aspects of memory processing other than
recollection may have been improved. Given the gains observed
on the 2-back and recognition part of the free and cued recall tasks,
and the fact that these two transfer tasks and the experimental
training all involve a yes/no recognition memory procedure, which
can rely heavily on familiarity (Westerberg et al., 2006), it is possi-
ble that participants may have learned to alter or suppress
responding on the basis of familiarity in a manner that enhanced
task performance.
In addition, recent studies have established factors that may
optimize repetition-lag procedure effects in normal aging. The
self-initiation of controlled processes on an open-ended, inten-
tional encoding task was highly correlated with improvements
on the training task (Bissig & Lustig, 2007). Furthermore, a more
recent study has demonstrated that strategies encouraging older
adults to spend sufﬁcient time and attention at encoding can
improve performance on recognition memory transfer tests (Lustig
& Flegal, 2008). Future research needs to take into account these
recent ﬁndings to explore whether these factors could be relevant
to successful cognitive training in AD.
