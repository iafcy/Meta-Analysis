Background and Purpose. There is an increasing interest in the eﬀect of nonpharmacological interventions on the course of
patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The objective of the present study is to determine the beneﬁts of a structured,
multidomain, mostly computer-based, cognitive training (MCT) οn the cognitive performance of patients with early-stage
AD. Method. Fifty patients with early-stage AD participated in the study. Patients were randomly allocated either to the
training program group (n = 25) or to a wait list control group (n = 25). The training program group received computer-
assisted MCT and linguistic exercises utilizing pen and paper supplemented by cognitive-linguistic exercises for homework.
The duration of the MCT intervention program was 15 weeks, and it was administered twice a week. Each session lasted
for approximately one hour. Objective measures of episodic memory, delayed memory, word recognition, attention,
executive function, processing speed, semantic ﬂuency, and naming were assessed at baseline and after the completion of
the program in both groups. Results. Analysis showed that in controls, delayed memory and executive function had
deteriorated over the observation period of 15 weeks, while the training group improved their performance in word
recognition, Boston Naming Test (BNT), semantic ﬂuency (SF), clock-drawing test (CDT), digit span forward (DSF), digit
span backward (DSB), trail-making test A (TMT A), and trail-making test B (TMT B). Comparison between the training
group and the controls showed that MCT had a signiﬁcant beneﬁcial eﬀect in delayed memory, naming, semantic ﬂuency,
visuospatial ability, executive functions, attention, and processing speed. Conclusions. The study provides evidence of a
beneﬁcial eﬀect of MCT with an emphasis on cognitive-language performance of patients with early-stage AD. Considering
the limited eﬃcacy of current pharmacological therapies in AD, concurrent computer-based MCT may represent an
additional enhancing treatment option in early-stage AD patients.

1. Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a slowly progressive neurodegen-
erative disorder, aﬀecting memory, executive function, visuo-
spatial skills, and language [1–4]. Depending on the stage of
the disease, the deﬁcits diﬀer. In comparison to those with
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), individuals with early-
stage dementia appear to perform more poorly in more than
one cognitive domain, leading to a more substantial interfer-
ence in daily activities and independent function [5], which
may negatively aﬀect the quality of life of patients and their
caregivers [6–8]. Unfortunately, current pharmacological
therapies have limited eﬃcacy in reversing or even halting
AD progression [9, 10].
A number of nonpharmacological approaches, aiming at
brain neuroplasticity, such as cognitive training [11, 12],
cognitive stimulation [13], and cognitive rehabilitation [1],
have entered the picture as potential strategies for the pre-
vention and treatment of the cognitive and behavioral symp-
toms of AD [7, 14]. Emerging rehabilitation approaches
for people with AD encompass a variety of techniques
(e.g., task-oriented training, strategy training, and individ-
ualized training).
According to systematic literature review [15], cognitive
training is more eﬀective when compared to cognitive stimu-
lation and cognitive rehabilitation in patients with MCI and
early-stage AD. Cognitive training is a guided set of standard
tasks that replicate speciﬁc cognitive functions. Each task has
several levels of diﬃculty, tailored to the individual’s ability,
and it is oﬀered in individual sessions. On the contrary, cog-
nitive rehabilitation aims to improve everyday functions by
using compensatory individual approaches. Lastly, cognitive
stimulation aims to improve cognitive function, not adaptive
tasks, through signiﬁcant use of orientation or reminiscence
therapy, oﬀered in group sessions while placing emphasis
on social interaction [1, 11, 15, 16].
Limited evidences of positive eﬀects of various cognitive-
improving techniques on cognitive functions, however, have
been reported [15, 17]. Moreover, several approaches of cog-
nitive training have been developed so far: some focus on a
speciﬁc cognitive domain, for example, memory or executive
functions [16, 18, 19], others on two or three cognitive
domains simultaneously [20–22], while others focus on
behavioral and psychological symptoms of AD [1, 23]. Fur-
thermore, Bahar-Fuchs et al. noticed that, although many
studies claim that language training was included in their
cognitive-training program, none of them provided speciﬁc
information about the domains of the language which were
trained as well as about the content of the language tasks
[24]. Therefore, it seems that a multidomain cognitive train-
ing with an emphasis on language could be the most appro-
priate and eﬀective approach.
Another issue under consideration, though, is that most
of the cognitive-training programs depend on the therapist
and many sessions are required. As such, they might not be
ideal when it comes to patient comfort. For this reason, more
recent studies suggest the use of computer training as
opposed to traditional training with the use of paper and
pencil [25]. In particular, paper and pencil cognitive training
has been reported to be more eﬀective when it is ecologi-
cally designed [26] and administered in groups [27] than
computer-based programs. A recent study of Tsolaki et al.
in patients with MCI reported that the pen and paper cogni-
tive training had better results in general cognitive function,
learning ability, delayed verbal recall, visual memory, ver-
bal ﬂuency, and visual selective attention compared to
computer-based cognitive training [28].
On the other hand, Man et al. investigated the eﬀective-
ness of a computer-based memory-training program versus
the same program administered by paper and pencil, in
people with questionable dementia [29]. The results dem-
onstrated that, although both programs improved partici-
pants’ memory performance, the computer memory training
improved more cognitive abilities of participants than the
paper and pencil training. Shao et al. reported that computer
cognitive training has certain advantages for patients with
early-stage AD [25]. First of all, it is an eﬀective and conve-
nient method. Moreover, it oﬀers self-paced, individualized
training, which sets the initial level of task diﬃculty accord-
ing to the baseline competency of participants and gradually
adjusts it as their performance improves.
Taking the aforementioned into consideration, in the
present study, we used a multidomain cognitive training
(MCT) with an emphasis on language. We believe that such
a training has many advantages: (a) it focuses on both cogni-
tive functions and language skills; (b) it is user-friendly to
patients with AD, as the computer is connected to a special
input panel using the commercially available RehaCom soft-
ware package; (c) the cognitive performance of the patient
can be assessed even after each session; (d) the level of diﬃ-
culty of the tasks does not depend on the therapist; (e) it
adapts to the needs of each patient; and (f) it provides an
objective measurement of the patient’s performance, limiting
the possibility of a performance under/overestimation.
In particular, in the present study, we were interested in
the beneﬁcial inﬂuence of MCT on the neuropsychological
performance of patients with early-stage AD, by using a com-
puterized program that would focus on several cognitive
domains simultaneously, accompanied by language exercises
with pen and paper, which concentrate mainly on language
deﬁcits. The study is based on the primary hypothesis that
patients who are receiving the 15-week computer-assisted
cognitive-linguistic training intervention with an emphasis
on alleviation of episodic memory, information processing
speed, executive functions, attention, confrontation naming,
semantic ﬂuency, and syntax would show improved perfor-
mance on standardized neuropsychological and linguistic
measures compared to the control group which will attend
the standard clinical care. Our secondary hypothesis was that
the beneﬁcial eﬀects would translate to improved activities of
daily living and functional communication.
2. Method
2.1. Participants. Participants were included in the study if
they fulﬁlled the following criteria: (1) a diagnosis of AD
according to the National Institute of Neurological and Com-
municative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s and
2
Neural Plasticity

Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA), (2) mild
(early-stage) AD (Clinical Dementia Rating score CDR =1
[30] and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of
16/30 or higher [31]), (3) age between 60 and 80 years, and
(4) at least 6 years of education. Exclusion criteria were (1)
presence of major psychiatric disorders (e.g., psychotic
symptoms or disorders, alcohol or illegal drug abuse, and
depression), (2) presence of another neurological disorder
(e.g., stroke, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury), and (3)
visual/hearing impairment or writing/reading disability suﬃ-
cient to impair the performance in the assessment and the
training. All participants had undergone clinical neurological
assessment, blood tests, and brain magnetic resonance imag-
ing scans that presented no evidence of other diseases.
2.2. Procedure
2.2.1.
Neurological,
Neuropsychological,
and
Language
Evaluation. In order to assess the participants’ cognitive sta-
tus (attention, processing speed, executive function, delayed
and episodic memory, and recognition) and language abili-
ties (naming, semantic ﬂuency, and word recall), the follow-
ing were used: (a) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA;
[32]); (b) trail-making test, part A and part B (TMT A and
TMT B; [33]); (c) digit forward and backward tests [34]; (d)
repeat and word recognition and delayed memory; (e) verbal
ﬂuency [35]; and (f) Boston Naming Test (BNT; [36]). In
addition, participants were assessed for depressive symptom-
atology by using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) [37],
whereas possible impairment of their everyday activities
was estimated via the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living
(IADL) questionnaire [38]. The participants’ evaluation was
performed by both a neurologist and an experienced neuro-
psychologist before and after the intervention program.
2.2.2. Multidomain Cognitive Training (MCT) with an
Emphasis on Language Abilities. Patients were randomly
assigned [39] to either attend the MCT program or be placed
in the control group and receive the usual standard clinical
care. Concerning the initial assessment stages, the neurolo-
gist was not aware of the neuropsychological evaluation,
and likewise, the neuropsychologist was not aware of the
neurologic assessment. Therefore, their individual results
did not aﬀect the diagnosis process and the selection, conse-
quently, of the patients for both groups. An individual thera-
pist ﬁnally assorted the patients in the groups (training and
control). The duration of the MCT intervention program
was 15 weeks, and it was administered on an individual basis
in semiweekly, 60-minute sessions. The ﬁrst part of the MCT
intervention was computer-based, and it lasted for 30
minutes. Using the commercially available RehaCom soft-
ware package—a specially designed input panel that can be
easily used by elderly people, accompanied by a large
screen—the intervention group received cognitive training
in several domains with an emphasis on episodic and delayed
memory, attention, processing speed, and executive func-
tions. All participants began the training at the beginner
level of the RehaCom software. The training modules auto-
matically adapted the training tasks to the user’s level of
performance. It provided the opportunity to train patients
on several levels of diﬃculty and length of sessions, and
according to whether the patient succeeded or failed the
task, the diﬃculty levels were automatically adjusted to
meet the patient’s ability. At the end of the training session,
the therapist could review the results from the RehaCom
result screen.
Furthermore, special prominence was given to the
improvement of patients’ language skills, and therefore, the
second part of the MCT included language exercises with
pen and paper. Since there is no software package available
in Greek for language skills, we collaborated with a linguist
for the creation of a structured language intervention. The
language intervention contained exercises of morphology,
syntax, semantics, naming, verbal ﬂuency, and word recall
with a progressive increase in diﬃculty in each category.
Patients moved at diﬀerent levels and achieved mastery at
their own pace, while the language therapist, throughout
the whole program, was taking into consideration each
patient’s individual needs. Each participant was given extra
cognitive and language tasks for practice at home, in a weekly
basis, in order to give them the opportunity to work on their
own and to get a clearer view of their skills and their diﬃcul-
ties. Both groups were evaluated within one week of complet-
ing the MCT.
The research protocol was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Medical School of Larissa, University of
Thessaly, and it was conducted in accordance with the princi-
ples of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written consent was
obtained from all the participantsof the present study (ortheir
caregivers) after having been informed of the nature of the
study they would take part in.
3. Statistical Analysis
Baseline group characteristics are presented as mean, stan-
dard deviations, and absolute and proportion values. Nor-
mality was assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov graphs.
Diﬀerences between the intervention and control groups at
baseline assessments were estimated via the use of Pearson’s
chi-square and Fisher’s exact test in the case of nominal var-
iables and with Mann–Whitney U test in the case of scale var-
iables. To evaluate the cognitive performance progress in
each group separately over the period of 15 weeks, we com-
pared the paired mean diﬀerence of the two assessments
(baseline versus endpoint) in each group, using the paired
sample t-test in case of normal distribution and Wilcoxon
signed-rank test in case of nonnormal. The eﬀect of the inter-
vention was estimated by comparing the mean diﬀerence of
the two assessments (baseline minus endpoint in each group)
between the two groups (training group versus controls).
ANOVA was applied in case of normal distribution. Other-
wise, the Mann–Whitney U test was used. Cohen’s d and
the eﬀect size of the intervention were calculated according
to the site https://www.uccs.edu/lbecker/. The level of signif-
icance was set at 0.05 for all the analyses. All statistical calcu-
lations were performed using the SPSS for Windows (version
21) statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

4. Results
From December of 2016 until July of 2017, a total of 106
mild AD patients attending the Clinical Laboratory of
Speech and Language Therapy of the Technological Edu-
cational Institute of Epirus were screened for participation
in the study. However, 56 patients were excluded for spe-
ciﬁc reasons (Figure 1), and therefore, 50 mild AD
patients were enrolled in the study, with no dropouts
noted among any of the patients during the training
period. These patients were randomly assigned either to
receive MCT (TG; n = 25) or to be placed in the control
group condition (CG; n = 25) to receive usual standard
clinical care.
The ﬁrst two groups received the MCT from February 1
to April 15, 2017, and the other three groups received MCT
with emphasis on linguistics from August 1 to November
15, 2017. All of the groups were then evaluated one week
after the completion of the MCT with emphasis on linguis-
tics (posttreatment).
Demographic and clinical characteristics of both groups
at baseline are presented in Table 1. Baseline scores in neuro-
psychological tests of the training and control group are
shown in Table 2. No statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in
baseline characteristics were found between the two groups.
The assessment of the paired mean diﬀerence of the
two evaluations (baseline versus endpoint) in each group
showed that the control group remained stable over the
observation period of 15 weeks in most of the neuropsy-
chological tests, except for delayed memory (p = 0 0085)
and TMT A (p = 0 001), which deteriorated (Table 3).
On the contrary, the training group improved their cogni-
tive performance in delayed memory (p ≤0 001), recogni-
tion
(p = 0 0284),
clock-drawing
test
(p = 0 01),
digit
forward test (p ≤0 001), digit backward test (p = 0 001),
TMT A (p ≤0 001), and TMT B (p = 0 017). Although
they generally improved, the endpoint performance of
the training group in word learning (p = 0 15) had not sig-
niﬁcantly improved (Table 3).
Comparison between the two groups (training group ver-
sus controls) in the mean diﬀerence of the two neuropsycho-
logical assessments (baseline minus endpoint in each group)
presented a signiﬁcant eﬀect of the intervention on the SF
(p ≤0 001), BNT (p ≤0 001), delayed memory (p ≤0 001),
word recognition (p = 0 008), TMT A (p ≤0 001), TMT B
(p = 0 003), DSF (p ≤0 001), CDT (p ≤0 001), and DSB
(p = 0 004), while no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was noted for
the recall of the study (Table 4). The absolute value of eﬀect
size of the training ranged from 0.02 for word recognition
to 0.69 for SF. The beneﬁcial eﬀect of the MCT cognitive
training with emphasis on linguistics in the training group
when compared to the control group is depicted in Figure 2.
5. Discussion
The present study provides preliminary evidence that MCT
improves cognition and language functions in general.
Speciﬁcally, our results showed that MCT had a signiﬁcant
impact on delayed memory, visuospatial abilities, and
executive functions. Considering the limited pharmacologi-
cal therapies available for AD, concurrent computer-based
MCT may represent an additional, personalized tool for the
management of AD patients.
The results of the present study conﬁrmed our ﬁrst
hypothesis, since all cognitive domains were improved after
the computer-assisted cognitive-language-training interven-
tion program and patients who underwent the MCT had
better performance than the control group. Furthermore,
our secondary hypothesis was supported. The training group
had verbal positive feedback on daily activities and func-
tional communication.
Our results are similar to those of previous studies that
reported notable improvement in delayed memory [22],
visuospatial abilities [21], executive function, and working
memory [22] after intervention by cognitive training, focused
only on memory. Other studies, though, did not ﬁnd a signif-
icant improvement in naming, semantic ﬂuency [21, 22, 40],
and attention/processing speed [16]. In these studies, how-
ever, cognitive training was applied only by focusing on
cognitive exercises without additional information. These
ﬁndings come in contrast with our results.
Our results hint towards the considerable eﬃcacy of
MCT in naming, semantic ﬂuency, and attention/processing
speed in the training group. Moreover, a mild improvement
at recall and recognition was also observed, without reaching
the statistical signiﬁcance threshold however. To the best of
our knowledge, the eﬀect of cognitive training in these spe-
ciﬁc domains had not been previously investigated.
AD destroys neurons and their connections in parts of
the brain involved in memory. Later on, it aﬀects cerebral
areas responsible for language, reasoning, and social behav-
ior. Eventually, many other areas of the brain are also dam-
aged [41–43]. Since current pharmacological approaches for
the cognitive decline in AD are insuﬃcient, computer-
based MCT should eventually be considered an alternative
option to prevent or delay the cognitive impairment in
early-stage AD patients.
To sum up, our study revealed a signiﬁcant eﬀect of MCT
in almost every neuropsychological test. The existing cogni-
tive training [16, 20–22] has a limited impact on most neuro-
psychological tests, probably because it does not approach
cognitive and language deﬁcits wholly. The multidomain
cognitive training (MCT) oﬀers a computer-based, personal-
ized, and user-friendly approach for patients with AD, which
simultaneously focuses on several domains.
Certain limitations of the present study need to be
acknowledged. Firstly, our study had a relatively short
follow-up period. Thus, a longer follow-up period would give
more robust and accurate results [44]. Moreover, our study
lacks analysis for additional confounders, such as the use of
speciﬁc pharmacological treatments among participants,
participants’ APOE-ε4 status, along with other environmen-
tal factors that may aﬀect the neuropsychological perfor-
mance of AD patients [45, 46]. Moreover, a possible
Hawthorne eﬀect in the intervention cannot be completely
excluded [47]. In addition, the lack of virtual intervention
in the control group and the frequent contact of the patients
of the training group with the therapist may have contributed
4

to the positive results. Finally, considering the relatively small
sample size, our study might be underpowered to examine
the complete and absolute eﬀect of MCT on AD.
6. Conclusions
This study showcases the beneﬁcial impact of MCT with
emphasis on linguistics and cognitive performance on
patients with early-stage AD. Considering the limited eﬃcacy
of the current pharmacological therapies in AD and the lim-
ited impact of other cognitive trainings as well, computer-
based MCT may represent an additional enhancing approach
in early-stage AD patients. Moreover, this data is promising,
in view of developing training methods to delay cognitive and
language decline in early-stage AD patients. Further studies

are of great necessity in order to properly elucidate the eﬀect
of MCT in the progress of these patients. Emphasis should
be placed on diﬀerent MCI subgroups and the eﬃcacy of
multidomain cognitive MCT in linguistic deﬁcits. If a sug-
gestion may be done, future studies should also take aim at
cognitive and language deﬁcits when patients are diagnosed
with MCI before it progresses to early-stage Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, so as to properly investigate whether MCT helps in
preventing AD.
