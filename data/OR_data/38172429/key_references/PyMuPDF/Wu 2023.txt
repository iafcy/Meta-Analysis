Objective: The neural mechanisms underlying the beneﬁcial effects of a com-
puterized cognitive training (CCT) program for improving episodic memory in
older persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remain unclear. This
study aimed to use both functional and structural brain changes to elucidate
the treatment effects of CCT on enhancing episodic memory. Design, setting,
and participants: Single-blinded, multicenter randomized controlled trial on
60 older adults with MCI in Fuzhou, China. Intervention: Participants were
randomly assigned to either an 8-week 24-hour CCT program or a health educa-
tion program as the control. Measurements: Clinical outcomes included
changes in scores on the immediate and/or delayed recall subtests of the Chi-
nese auditory verbal learning test (CAVLT) and rey complex ﬁgure test (CFT),

and changes in gray matter volume and the functional connectivity of the pos-
terior cingulate cortex (PCC) and hippocampus in the Papez circuit on mag-
netic resonance imaging. Results: Signiﬁcant group-by-time effects showed
greater improvements in both immediate and delayed recall scores of CAVLT
and delayed recall scores of Rey CFT in participants receiving the CCT program
compared to those in the health education program. Among the CCT partici-
pants, seed-based analyses revealed decreases in functional connectivity of the
PCC and hippocampus with neural substrates in the parietal and occipital
regions. The decreased PCC and precuneus connectivity were found to mediate
patients’ improvements in immediate recall function. Conclusion: An 8-week
CCT program was effective for improving episodic memory in older individuals
with MCI. The decrease in connectivity originating from the PCC and hippocam-
pus is suggestive of potential plastic changes in the Papez circuit, which could
have alleviated the age-related compensatory mechanism. The ﬁndings of this
study also shed light on expanding the content and extending the frequency
and duration of the CCT program in future studies. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry

Highlights
 What is the primary question addressed by this study?
How does computerized cognitive training (CCT) improve the episodic memory performance related to the
Papez circuit in individuals with mild cognitive impairment?
 What is the main ﬁnding of this study?
In this randomized trial that included 60 older persons with mild cognitive impairment, the CCT improved
their episodic memory performances, which were mediated by the decrement of the functional connectiv-
ity between the posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus in the Papez circuit.
 What is the meaning of the ﬁnding?
This trial may provide theoretical insight into the clinical application and rehabilitation mechanism of CCT
on episodic memory improvements.
INTRODUCTION
A
s
the
aging
population
grows,
age-related
degeneration such as mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) and dementia has become a major societal
concern.1,2 Unlike patients with dementia, individuals
with MCI are characterized by isolated cognitive func-
tion losses with a milder severity level.3−5 Episodic
memory has been found to be sensitive to age-related
neurodegeneration.6 Episodic memory is the ability to
learn, store, and retrieve information and events that
occurred in daily living.7 Previous studies revealed
negative relationships between episodic memory per-
formance and cognitive aging.8,9 Therefore, episodic
memory decline is a main concern in the management
of individuals with MCI.
Studies have shown promising treatment effects of
CCT on individuals with MCI. For instance, meta-anal-
yses of studies on CCT revealed that individuals with
MCI had improved global cognitive function, memory,
and attention after the interventions.10,11 The most fre-
quent dosage of the CCT in 17 trials cited in one paper
was 24 sessions.10 The duration of the 24-session train-
ing ranged from 8 to 24 weeks.12,13 Other studies sug-
gested that, among cognitive deﬁcits, loss of episodic
memory is common among individuals with MCI.14 In
addition, the positive effects of cognitive training on
improving episodic memory were found to compen-
sate for other cognitive domain deﬁcits in individuals
with MCI or mild-to-moderate dementia.15,16 However,
the neural mechanism underlying the treatment effects
of CCT on episodic memory is still unclear.

Converging evidence suggests that the Papez circuit
plays a major role in subserving episodic memory.17
The Papez circuit is primarily composed of neural sub-
strates from the limbic system, including the hippocam-
pus, anterior thalamic nucleus, mammillary bodies, and
posterior cingulate cortex (PCC).18-20 These Papez cir-
cuit nodes are connected to act upon the neocortical
sites to subserve the encoding and retrieval processes
of the episodic memory.21 Damages to nodes of the
Papez circuit were reported to impact on episodic
memory performance.22,23 In particular, the PCC and
hippocampus were found to be structurally connected
within the circuit.24−28 More importantly, patients with
MCI showed signiﬁcant aversive changes in the struc-
tural integrity29 or functional connectivity30,31 of the
PCC and hippocampus nodes. Hyper-functional con-
nectivity of the PCC with the precuneus was positively
associated with participants’ low episodic memory per-
formance in MCI due to suspected Alzheimer’s disease,
especially for the amnestic MCI type.30 Decreased gray
matter volume and increased functional connectivity of
the hippocampus to more diffuse areas of the brain
were negatively associated with participants’ episodic
memory performance.29,31 Therefore, the structure and
function of the PCC and hippocampus would be the
key candidates in this study to reﬂect the changes in
episodic memory of older adults with MCI.
This study aimed to elucidate the neural process
enhancement resulting from a group of older adults
with MCI in a randomized controlled trial of an 8-
week multimodal CCT program. We hypothesized
that participants who complete the standardized
training program, when compared with those in the
control group, would show signiﬁcant improvements
in episodic memory measures. We further hypothe-
sized that the improvements in episodic memory
measures would be associates with an increase in the
gray matter volume of the hippocampus and PCC
and a decrease in the hyperfunctional connectivity
among the hippocampus, PCC, and their related
nodes within the Papez circuit.
METHOD
Study Design and Registrations
This study employed a parallel-group, single-
blinded, three-center randomized controlled trial
design in accordance with the CONSORT statement.
Ethics of the trial was approved by the ethical com-
mittees of the participating hospitals (2020QX-001-02,
2020-054-02, SPHFJP-L2020001-02). The trial was reg-
istered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry in June
2020 (ChiCTR2000034012).
Participants
Out-patients diagnosed with MCI in the memory
clinics of three hospitals located in Fuzhou were
invited to participate in the screening tests. Regarding
the method of recruitment, the study was advertised
on the websites of the hospitals and on notice boards
in the memory clinics. The patients who intended to
participate were explained the purpose of the study,
and their informed consent was obtained, before com-
pleting the screening tests. Those who fulﬁlled the
inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. Physi-
cians working in the memory clinics were responsible
for diagnosing MCI in the participants according to
Petersen’s criteria published in 2018.1 The inclusion
criteria for the participants were: 50−85 years old;
score less than or equal to 25 (£ 24 for those with less
than 12 years of education) on the Chinese version of
the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA)32; score of
2 or 3 on the global deterioration scale (GDS)33; right-
handedness; and no contraindications for magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). The exclusion criteria were
as follows: current or history of dementia or other
psychiatric diseases; score greater than 10 on the
Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) for presence of
depressive mood34; score greater than or equal to 5 on
the Hachinski ischemic scale35 for identifying possible
vascular-related causes; current or history of alcohol
or drug abuse; and on medication within the last 2
weeks that may affect cognitive functions.
Randomization and Masking
We randomly assigned eligible participants into
the training group (received CCT program) and the
control group (received health education program) in
a ratio of 1:1. Participant group allocation was con-
ducted by a research team member who was not
involved in the intervention and assessment, using a
computer-generated sequence of blocks of four. In
this study, it was not possible to blind the participants
because the contents of the experimental and control

interventions had to be explained to them before ran-
domization. The single blinding was applied to the
clinicians who conducted the baseline and postpro-
gram assessments, as they did not have knowledge
about
the
group
assignment
and
interventions
received by the participants. Thus, potential assessor
biases were minimized in this trial.
Procedures
Baseline assessments were conducted within 1 week
before the participants commenced the interventions.
Postintervention assessments were completed within 1
week after the last training session in the 8th week. Cog-
nitive tests and structural and functional magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) were conducted during both
assessments by research team members who did not
have knowledge about the group assignment and inter-
ventions received by the participants.
Computerized Cognitive Training Program (CCT)
The CCT used in this study was the cognitive assess-
ment and rehabilitation training machine (called the
System) (No. YJRZ-LJ-01), which has been approved by
the Chinese FDA (No. 20212190249) (https://www.
nmpa.gov.cn/datasearch/search-result.html). The CCT
consists of 11 modules involving training tasks that
cover various cognitive domains common to neurode-
generation, such as attention, working memory, and
response speed. Details of the names, content descrip-
tions, and cognitive domains of the training modules
can be found in Table 1 of Supplementary Material. In
general, the contents of the modules range from simple
tasks tapping basic cognitive functions to complex tasks
tapping advanced cognitive functions. For instance,
module #1 is “Warm Up” involves basic visual attention
and simple response task design; while module #11 is
“Mental Rotation” involves advanced attention control
and working memory for image transformation. The
training program consisted of three 1-hour sessions per
week for 8 weeks, giving a total of 24 hours. All sessions
were conducted at the department of rehabilitation in
the hospital from which the participant was recruited.
In each session, a research team clinician was responsi-
ble for preparing the participant to engage in the CCT
according to a personalized task protocol (see below).
All clinicians were occupational therapists and received
training on operating the software and hardware of the
System. The participant sat in front of a computer screen
of the System, located in a quiet corner, on which the
task was displayed. Each participant was explained the
operation of the System in the ﬁrst session. The partici-
pant was required to pay attention to the stimuli dis-
played and make appropriate responses through a
mouse-like device of the System. The progression of the
tasks/modules was automated according to the proto-
col. The clinician ensured that the participant was com-
fortable throughout the training session and offered rest
breaks whenever necessary.
Participants’ CCT program was based on a person-
alized task protocol designed by the research team.
The purpose of the personalization was to increase
the sense of relevance to enhance the participant’s
motivation to engage in the training. The personaliza-
tion regime involved organizing the tasks in a
sequence according to the participant’s cognitive deﬁ-
cits based on the less than full MoCA item scores at

baseline. Task demands in the 11 modules were
mapped to the MoCA items with reference to the
mapping scheme described in a previous study36
(Table 1, Supplementary Material). Modules that
were associated with the MoCA-based deﬁcits were
collated and assigned to the participants earlier in the
training session than other tasks. The delivery of these
modules followed the numbering of the CCT mod-
ules, that is, from relatively basic cognition functions
and simple tasks to relatively advanced cognition
functions and complex tasks. Tasks in one module
were organized in six to nine difﬁculty levels. For
instance, the #8 “working memory” module employs
the n-back paradigm. Module #8 were assigned to the
participants for less than full scores on the MoCA’s
“Digit Backward” (1/1), “7s Subtraction” (3/3), or
“Orientation” (6/6). This module required the partici-
pants to performing the following: “compare stimu-
lus that just appeared with one previous designated
stimulus, and press a key on the keyboard to indicate
a match between the two stimuli” (Supplementary
Material, Table 1). This module has nine difﬁculty lev-
els, graded according to the nth back and complexity
of the objects, and the similarity of the outlook
between the stimulus and matched objects. Levels 1
−3 were one-back, with increasing complexity and
similarity of the stimulus and matched objects. In con-
trast, levels 7−9 were three-back, with increasing
object complexity and similarity. For each module
assigned, the participant began with the easiest level,
and then progressed to the next levels according to
the performance achieved in the previous level. The
rules of progression were based on the accuracy rate
achieved within the same level: greater than or equal
to 80%: advances from a lower to a higher level; 60%
−79%: repeats the same level; and less than 60%: re-
track from a higher to a lower level. The accurate rate
of each participant within one level in one task was
computed by the system right after the task comple-
tion. The adaptive algorithm of the System used the
accurate rate to direct the assignment of the task. The
progression of tasks across different difﬁculty levels
and across modules was automated in the System.
Health Education Program as Control
The health education program consisted of eight 1-
hour weekly sessions for participants assigned to the con-
trol group. The content of the health education program
was created based on the guidelines for the prevention of
Alzheimer’s Disease published by Barnard et al.37 in
2014. The content consisted of information on the risk fac-
tors of cognitive impairment or dementia and prevention
strategies covering dietary and lifestyle measures. The
participants attended face-to-face education courses in
another location within the department of rehabilitation.
Two clinicians in the research team, who were occupa-
tional therapists in training and were not involved in the
CCT program, conducted the control training. The clini-
cians received training on the contents and educational
methods. The reason for providing the health education
program was to maintain contact with the participants in
order to minimize their attrition in the post-intervention
assessments. The participants were reminded not to
engage in cognitive training regardless of whether it was
delivered face-to-face or through a computer.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measures were two clinical
measures of episodic memory, including the immediate
and delayed recall subtests of the Chinese Version Audi-
tory Verbal Learning Test (CAVLT) and the delayed
recall subtest of the Chinese Version Rey-Osterrieth
Complex Figure Test (Rey CFT). These subtests assess
the
verbal
and
non-verbal
episodic
memory,
respectively.38,39 In the CAVLT immediate and delayed
recall subtests, participants are required to learn and
recall 15 words in the ﬁrst instance and then recall the
same words after 20 minutes of delay. In the Chinese
Version Rey CFT, the participants are required to copy-
draw a ﬁgure, and after 20 minutes, to draw the ﬁgure
based on their recall. The secondary outcome measures
were signals from the MRI scan, including the gray mat-
ter volume (GMV) of the PCC and hippocampus and
their functional connectivity.
MRI Data
MRI Data Collection
The MRI data were obtained using the Siemens
Prisma 3.0 Tesla system (Erlangen, Germany) located
in one of the participating hospitals. The T1 structural
images and resting-state functional images were
acquired using MPRAGE T1-weighted sequence and
Gradient-echo EPI sequence. The T1 sequence param-
eters were: 256 £ 256 matrix size, 192 contiguous

Gray Matter Volume
Volumetric analysis of the gray matter was per-
formed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12)
software (https://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/).
Seed-Based Functional Connectivity
Resting-state functional MRI data were preprocessed
by using SPM12 and DPABI (a toolbox for Data Process-
ing & Analysis of Brain Imaging)40 software through the
following processes: removal of the 10 ﬁrst time points,
slice timing, realignment (Friston model, threshold was
3 mm transmission or 3 degrees rotation), regressing out
covariates, normalization (Voxel size = 3 £ 3 £ 3 mm3),
smoothening with a 6-mm full width at half maxima
Gaussian kernel and temporally Filter (0.01-0.1Hz).
Statistical Analysis
Group differences in demographic characteristics at
the baseline line were examined using the Chi-square
test and t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. The CCT treat-
ment effects were tested using a linear mixed model
(LMM) on the primary outcomes, scores on the
CAVLT and Rey CFT subtests, and the secondary out-
comes, the GMVs of the PCC and hippocampus and
their functional connectivity. The LMM generates the
ﬁxed and random effects of the Group, Time, and
Group £ Time, with age, gender, and years of educa-
tion of the participants as covariates. Within-group
comparisons were conducted using paired t-test or
Wilcoxon test. Effect sizes of the CCT for participants
in the training group, represented by Cohen’s d value,
were calculated according to the formula: Cohen0s
d ¼ Mean diff
SD diff , where the numerator is the mean of the
difference in scores (Mean diff), and the denominator
is the standard deviation of the difference in scores (SD
diff).41 Partial correlation analysis was then performed,
after
controlling
for
age,
gender,
and
years
of
education, to explore the associations between the
changes in the primary and secondary outcomes that
showed signiﬁcant group-by-time effects. The signiﬁ-
cance level was set at a two-tailed P value of 0.05.
For the MRI data, a seed-based approach was per-
formed to identify the alternation functional connec-
tivity of the PCC and hippocampus. The regions of
interest (ROIs) of these two neural substrates were
deﬁned using the WFU_Pickatlas software (www.
fmri.wfubmc.edu).42 Functional connectivity of the
neural substrates was based on Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcients between the two ROIs and the whole
brain. The treatment effects on the functional connec-
tivity were tested with SPM12 and the thresholds
were set as Voxel p<0.005 uncorrected and Cluster
p<0.05 FDR corrected.
Second level analyses were conducted after a sig-
niﬁcant association was found between PCC precu-
neus
functional
connectivity
and
the
CAVLT
immediate recall subtest scores. Mediation models
were constructed with the Group as an independent
variable, changes in the CAVLT immediate recall sub-
test score as the dependent variable, and PCC_precu-
neus connectivity as the mediator variable, after
controlling for age, gender, and years of education.
The SPSS PROCESS macro software was used to test
the indirect effect using the nonparametric bootstrap-
ping procedure (5,000 times of bootstrapping), and
the 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) for the effect infer-
ence was obtained.
RESULTS
Participants’ Characteristics

2020
and
Dec
2021,
106
out-
patients with MCI were invited for the screening,
and 60 of them were eligible to participate in the
study. Thirty participants were randomly assigned
to the CCT, and 30 participants to the health edu-
cation program as the control. Three participants
(one in CCT and two in the control) dropped out
due to refusal to complete the post-intervention
MRI scan or residential relocation. All other partic-
ipants completed the interventions. However, four
participants were excluded from the data analyses
due to over-threshold head-motions in the MRI
scans (two in CCT and two in the control). The

ﬁnal sample size that entered the analyses was 53
participants, with 27 in the CCT and 26 in the con-
trol group (Supplementary Material, Fig. 1). No
signiﬁcant differences were found in the demo-
graphic characteristics between the two groups
(Table 1).
Primary Outcome Differences
The group-by-time effect was signiﬁcant for score
of the CAVLT immediate recall subtest score (LMM,
t= -2.773, df=51, p = 0.008), CAVLT delayed recall
subtest (LMM, t = -2.727, df = 51, p = 0.009), and Rey
CFT recall subtest (LMM, t = -2.590, df = 51,
p = 0.012) (Table 2, Fig. 1 A, B). Participants in the
CCT
group
showed
signiﬁcant
post-intervention
improvements in the scores of the CAVLT immediate
recall (paired t-test, t = 4.097, df = 26, p<0.001,
Cohen’s d = 0.789), CAVLT delayed recall (Wilcoxon
test, Z = -2.772, p = 0.004, Cohen’s d = 0.603), and Rey
CFT recall tests (paired t-test, t = 3.672, df = 26,
p = 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.707), which was not observed
among those in the control group (p>0.05) (Table 2,
Fig. 1A, B).
Secondary Outcome Differences
No signiﬁcant group, time, and group-by-time
effects were found in the GMV of the PCC and
hippocampus (p>0.05) (Table 2, Fig. 2C, D). However,
there were signiﬁcant changes in the hippocampus
GMV in the CCT participants (t = 2.224, df = 26,
p = 0.035, Cohen’s d = 0.430) compared to the control
counterparts (t = 1.646, df = 25, p = 0.112).
Functional Connectivity
Two signiﬁcant changes in functional connectivity
were observed among participants in the CCT group
but
not
in
the
control
group.
First,
signiﬁcant
decreases in functional connectivity were found
between the ROIs deﬁned at the PCC and those at the
right precuneus (t-test, voxel number=162, t = -4.067,
df = 51, cluster PFDR = 0.033) and left angular gyrus
(t-test, voxel number = 244, t = -3.997, df = 51, cluster
PFDR = 0.012) (Table 3, Fig. 2A). Second, the ROIs
deﬁned
at the
hippocampus
showed
signiﬁcant
decreases in functional connectivity with the right
inferior occipital lobe (t-test, voxel number = 371, t =
-4.162, df = 51, cluster PFDR < 0.001) and the left infe-
rior parietal lobe (t-test, voxel number = 578, t =
-4.030, df = 51, cluster PFDR < 0.001) (Table 3, Fig. 2B).
Signiﬁcant
negative
correlations
were
revealed
between the changes in PCC_precuneus connectivity
and the change in scores on the CAVLT immediate
recall subtest (r = -0.438, df = 22, p = 0.032) after con-
trolling age, gender, and years of education. No other

signiﬁcant correlations between functional connectiv-
ity and cognitive test results were revealed.
Mediating Effect of PCC_Precuneus Connectivity
The changes in the PCC_precuneus connectivity
were found to be a mediating factor (bootstrapping
indirect CI: [0.18, 2.37]) but not the direct effects (CI:
[-0.40, 4.74]) of the CCT. In particular, the CCT had
negative effects on the PCC_precuneus connectivity
changes (bootstrapping CI: [-0.25, -0.06]), while the
latter also had negative effects on the improvements
of scores on the CAVLT immediate recall subtest
(bootstrapping CI: [-14.25, -0.07]) (Fig. 2D).
Analysis of CCT Training Performance in the
Training Group
To further verify the training effects, analyses were
conducted on the participants’ performances in the
CCT training tasks between the ﬁrst and last sessions.
For participants who scored lower on the MoCA’s
Delay Recall item (n = 12, 0 to 1), the greatest training
effect
was
in
the
“Working
Memory”
module

Computerized Cognitive Training Enhances Episodic Memory by Down-Modulating
828

DISCUSSION
This study explored the effects of an 8-week CCT
program on improving episodic memory functions in
a group of older adults with MCI. Positive training
effects including improvement of participants’ imme-
diate and delayed recall functions were revealed. Our
study is the ﬁrst to report on the positive training
effects of the Cognitive Assessment and Rehabilita-
tion Training Machine with a randomized controlled
trial combined with the brain imaging method. The
MRI ﬁndings demonstrated the plasticity of the Papez
circuit in response to the cognitive training. The train-
ing-related decreases in functional connectivity of the
PCC and hippocampus with the occipital and parietal
regions were found within the Papez circuit. How-
ever, the hypothesis that the training would increase
the gray matter volumes of these two neural sub-
strates was rejected. In particular, the decrease in con-
nectivity between the PCC and precuneus suggests a
plausible reversed age-related compensatory mecha-
nism resulting from the cognitive training. The
reversed
mechanism
would
have
facilitated
the
encoding and rehearsal, and hence the retrieval pro-
cess in episodic memory, which was reﬂected by the
improved post-training CAVLT immediate recall
scores in the participants.
The 24-session CCT program resulted in signiﬁcant
improvements in the participants’ verbal immediate
and delayed recall, measured with CAVLT, and
object delayed recall, measured with Rey CFT. Our
ﬁndings were consistent with the improvements in
verbal delayed recall obtained after engaging MCI
participants in an 8-week CCT.12 Li et al. 13 reported
the 6-month computerized training effects covering
episodic memory, working memory, visual search,
and imagery, and the results showed improvements
in attention, memory, and executive functions. Our
results showed that the participants with more mem-
ory impairment in the training group has the greatest
improvement in the “Working Memory” module, fol-
lowed by the “Attention−Divided” and “Mental
Rotation,” while the participants with less memory
impairment showed a lower training effect in the
“Working Memory” module. Our ﬁndings on the par-
ticipants’ improved performances in the training
modules concur with other studies reporting that
attention and executive function (i.e., mental rotation)
contribute to the encoding43 and retrieval44 processes
in episodic memory.
The ﬁrst neural effect of CTT was decreased func-
tional connectivity between the PCC and the precuneus
and angular gyrus. The decreased connectivity was
associated with the participants’ improvements in the
immediate but not the delayed recall function. The rate
limiting factor between the two types of recalls was the
time available to encode and rehearse the information
before memory consolidation.45 In episodic memory,
successful encoding and rehearsal can facilitate reten-
tion, and hence the retrieval. The precuneus was sug-
gested to play important roles in the self-processing
operation and mental imagery, contributing to informa-
tion storage and retrieval.46 A typical example of the
processes could be to relate the cues in word-pair repe-
titions with one’s ﬁrst-person knowledge about the cue
and the words. The second neural effect of CCT was
decreased in the PCC_angular_gyrus connectivity. Acti-
vation of the angular gyrus in the lateral parietal cortex
was associated with the retrieval process in episodic
memory.47 Angular gyrus also subserves the episodic
memory buffer involving cross-modal information,48,49
especially in its subjective recollection49,50 and corre-
spondence between retrieval outcomes and expecta-
tions.51
Age-related
hyper-functional
connectivity
among the neural substrates was found to reﬂect the
compensatory mechanism to maintain cognitive func-
tions among older individuals.52 It is therefore plausible
that the decrease in the PCC_precuneus and PCC_an-
gular_gyrus connectivity is attributable to the CCT,
which could have reversed the participants’ compensa-
tory mechanism. The differences in the neural processes
subserved by the two PPC-related connectivity could
explain why the PCC_precuneus rather than PCC_an-
gular_gyrus connectivity modulated the participants’
immediate recall changes after the CCT. In fact, the
design of the “Working Memory” module in the CCT
explores immediate rather than delayed recall, and no
module explores the delayed recall function. Neverthe-
less, the CCT did not seem to signiﬁcantly increase
participants’ volume of the PCC. Future studies should
be conducted to explore the effects of adding specially
designed modules for training delayed recall function
and increasing the dosage of the cognitive training,
and their impact on the gray matter volume of the
Papez circuit neural substrates.
The CCT effects also included a decrease in the hip-
pocampus-related connectivity. The inferior parietal

auditory and visual patterns,53 and the hippocampu-
s_inferior_parietal connectivity was reported to sub-
serve

formation
and
presentations.54,55
Neurodegenerative changes among individuals with
MCI in the inferior parietal lobe were suggested to lead
to compensatory processes within the default mode net-
work.56 The decrease in the hippocampus_inferior_occi-
pital connectivity suggests a positive treatment effect of
cognitive training on visual processing57 and object epi-
sodic memory.58 In the CCT, at least four modules,
namely the “Visuospatial Function,” “Visual Search,”
“Attention,” and “Working Memory,” were designed
to explore the visual processing functions of objects.
The non-signiﬁcant correlations between the hippocam-
pus-related connectivity and the primary study out-
come could be due to the mismatch in the mode of
testing, that is, verbal versus object in the CAVLT, and
immediate versus delayed recall in the Rey CFT.
The CCT program in this study has 11 training
modules, which cover a wide variety of cognitive func-
tions. However, there is no module that is speciﬁcally
designed to train the delayed recall function. Addi-
tional modules on delayed recall function should be
considered in the future development of CCT. Our
ﬁndings further support the use of multidomain con-
tents for cognitive training in individual with MCIs.
The results indicate the clinical feasibility of using the
Cognitive Assessment and Rehabilitation Training
Machine in different hospital settings for the rehabilita-
tion of older adults with MCI. Further studies are
needed to explore whether an increase in the dosage
(duration and hours) of the training would intensify
the training effects. Alternative delivery modes of the
training and their effects, such as hybrid (i.e., hospital-
based and online) or 100% online can also be explored.
LIMITATIONS
First, the sample size of this study was relatively
small, which would limit the effect sizes and generaliza-
tion of the results. Although the effect sizes of most
ﬁndings fall under a moderate range and the partici-
pants were typical older adults with MCI, readers
should interpret the ﬁndings with caution. Future stud-
ies should consider replicating the CCT program in a
larger sample size. Second, the duration and mode of
contact of the health education program received by
the participants in the control group could have biased
the results. The fewer number of hours, that is, 8 hours
(control) versus 24 hours (intervention), could have
weakened the effects on the outcome measures among
the control participants. In contrast, the full 1-hour face-
to-face contacts for eight sessions with the clinicians in
the control group, when compared with the brief con-
tacts in each of the 24 sessions in the training group,
might have constituted a placebo effect. Although the
participants’ performances in the CCT showed signiﬁ-
cant improvements, substantiating the training effects,
future studies should replicate the study with the same
exposure hours between the intervention and control
groups. Third, the 8-week duration, 24-hour dosage,
and without an extended follow up design could have
constrained the positive effects of the cognitive training.
Replication of the clinical trial with an increased dosage
and a 6-month follow-up period can offer further evi-
dence on the efﬁcacy of the CCT. Finally, the use of rest-
ing-state MRI, which offers less precise measures of the
neural processes associated with episodic memory than
other methods. Event-related functional MRI with par-
ticipants performing episodic memory tasks in real
time can improve the speciﬁcity of the functional con-
nectivity in future studies.
CONCLUSION
The 8-week CCT program improved the episodic
memory (immediate recall) of participants with MCI.
Brain imaging results indicated decreases in the func-
tional connectivity originated from the PCC and hip-
pocampus, as part of the Papez circuit, with neural
substrates in the parietal and occipital regions. The
training-related changes in the functional connectivity
suggest a down-modulation of the neurodegenerative
hyper-functional connectivity within the Papez cir-
cuit’s neural substrates common in older adults with
MCI. Our ﬁndings provide insights regarding the
content design and dosage of CCT for enhancing cog-
nitive functions of MCI individuals.
