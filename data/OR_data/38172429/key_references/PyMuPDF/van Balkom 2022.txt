Introduction: Cognitive training (CT) has been proposed as a treatment option for cognitive impairment in Par­
kinson’s disease (PD). We aimed to assess the efficacy of adaptive, computerized CT on cognitive function in PD. 
Methods: In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial we enrolled PD patients that experienced substantial 
subjective cognitive complaints. Over a period of eight weeks, participants underwent 24 sessions of comput­
erized multi-domain CT or an active control intervention for 45 min each (randomized 1:1). The primary 
outcome was the accuracy on the Tower of London task; secondary outcomes included effects on other neuro­
psychological outcomes and subjective cognitive complaints. Outcomes were assessed before and after training 
and at six-months follow-up, and analyzed with multivariate mixed-model analyses. 
Results: The intention-to-treat population consisted of 136 participants (n = 68 vs. n = 68, age M: 62.9y, female: 
39.7%). Multivariate mixed-model analyses showed no group difference on the Tower of London accuracy 
corrected for baseline performance (n = 130): B: −0.06, 95% CI: −0.27 to 0.15, p = 0.562. Participants in the CT 
group were on average 0.30 SD (i.e., 1.5 s) faster on difficulty load 4 of this task (secondary outcome): 95% CI: 
−0.55 to −0.06, p = 0.015. CT did not reduce subjective cognitive complaints. At follow-up, no group differences 
were found. 
Conclusions: This study shows no beneficial effect of eight-week computerized CT on the primary outcome (i.e., 
planning accuracy) and only minor improvements on secondary outcomes (i.e., processing speed) with limited 
clinical impact. Personalized or ecologically valid multi-modal intervention methods could be considered to 
achieve clinically meaningful and lasting effects.   
1. Background 
Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent in Parkinson’s disease 
(PD). Even at diagnosis 25% of patients with PD experience deficits in 
one or more cognitive domains [1] and approximately 50% will have 
developed PD dementia (PD-D) after ten years [2]. 
The currently available pharmacological treatments for cognitive 
impairment in PD have limited efficacy, focus on relieving symptoms but 
not on delaying decline, and can have negative side-effects [3,4]. There 
is some evidence that cognitive training (CT) may alleviate cognitive

impairment and slow down cognitive decline by boosting neuro­
plasticity [5] and improving the efficiency of global and regional brain 
networks [6]. A meta-analysis from 2015 found modest positive effects 
of CT [7], while a more recent Cochrane meta-analysis on the efficacy of 
CT for PD mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) or PD-D did not [8]. Both 
overviews did, however, show evidence for the efficacy of CT on 
improving specific cognitive domains, including executive function [7], 
attention/processing speed [7,8], working memory [7], and verbal 
memory [8] (mean Hedges’ g ranging from 0.30 to 0.74). In addition, 
two studies showed long-term positive effects of CT, lasting up to 18 
months after training [9,10], suggesting its potential in delaying 
cognitive decline. Nevertheless, the current (aggregated) evidence is 
imprecise and there is a lack of large-scale trials with active control 
conditions and adequate double blinding [7,8]. Consequently, there is a 
need for larger trials that overcome limitations of earlier trials and can 
provide more reliable evidence on the efficacy of CT. 
In this report we present the primary results of the COGnitive 
Training In Parkinson Study (COGTIPS) [11]. Based on earlier 
meta-analyses, we hypothesized that our CT that was focused on exec­
utive, attentional and processing speed functions would 1) improve 
executive function (primary outcome), but also other cognitive func­
tions, including attention/processing speed and working memory, 2) 
reduce subjective cognitive complaints and 3) we expected effects to 
endure at least six-months. 
2. Methods 
2.1. Trial design 
COGTIPS is a large mono-center phase-3 double-blind RCT to assess 
superiority of eight-week computerized CT over an active control con­
dition (AC). Participants were enrolled at the Amsterdam University 
Medical Centers (Amsterdam UMC), location VUmc. A detailed study 
protocol article was previously published [11]. 
COGTIPS was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the VU 
University Medical Center and prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials. 
gov (NCT02920632; September 30, 2016). The study was carried out in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided 
written informed consent. 
2.2. Participants 
We enrolled 140 patients diagnosed by a neurologist with PD and a) 
Hoehn and Yahr stage <4, b) substantial subjective cognitive complaints 
(PD Cognitive Functional Rating Scale (PD-CFRS) score >3), and c) 
home access to a computer or tablet with internet. Exclusion criteria 
were a) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score <22 [12], b) in­
dications of current drug- or alcohol abuse (CAGE AID-interview score 
>1), c) moderate or severe depressive symptoms (Beck Depression In­
ventory (BDI) score >18), d) impulse control disorder (positive 
screening by diagnostic criteria), e) non-benign psychotic symptoms 
(positive screening by the Schedule for Assessment of Positive Symp­
toms – PD), or f) history of traumatic brain injury with loss of con­
sciousness for >15 min and/or posttraumatic amnesia >1 h. 
2.3. Procedures 
Participants were randomized over an experimental CT condition 
and an AC condition in an 1:1 fashion and both participants and 
outcome assessors were blinded during all assessments (for details see 
Ref. [11]). In both conditions, participants followed an online 
home-based intervention during eight weeks, three times a week for 
approximately 45 min (total duration: 1080 min). The CT consisted of 13 
training games that focused on attention, processing speed and execu­
tive functions, and had an adaptive difficulty based on the individual 
participants’ performance, based on the ‘Braingymmer’ online CT 
platform 
(www.braingymmer.com; 
Dezzel 
Media). 
Intervention 
compliance was automatically registered and checked by non-blinded 
study members and every two weeks we had phone contact with par­
ticipants to maximize involvement and solve potential issues. The games 
were not part of the pre- and post-intervention neuropsychological as­
sessments. We corrected for non-specific cognitive engagement by using 
an AC that consisted of three games without difficulty adjustments (i.e., 
hangman, trivia questions and solitaire). 
At baseline (T0), after training (T1, after approximately nine weeks) 
and at follow-up (T2, approximately six-months after training) patients 
underwent an extensive assessment that included neuropsychological 
tests, questionnaires and interviews (see below and [11] for details). 
3. Outcomes 
The primary outcome measure was the efficacy of CT, relative to the 
AC, on the percentage correct responses (i.e. accuracy) on a computer­
ized self-paced version of the Tower of London (ToL) task at T1 [13,14]. 
The ToL covers various executive functions including planning, inhibi­
tion, 
attention 
and 
working 
memory 
and 
consists 
of 
100 
pseudo-randomized trials with varying difficulty, ranging from one-step 
to five-step solutions (task-load S1–S5). Participants were excluded from 
ToL data analysis if they scored <75% on the one-step (S1) trials. We 
used ToL response time as a secondary outcome. A detailed list of all 
assessment instruments is provided in Supplementary Material 1. 
Additional secondary outcomes were CT effects at T1 and T2 on 
subjective cognitive complaints and cognitive performance on latent 
cognitive factors (see Statistical methods). Subjective cognitive com­
plaints were measured with the PD-CFRS and the Cognitive Failures 
Questionnaire. Latent cognitive factors were defined on the basis of an 
extensive neuropsychological test battery that mapped global cognitive 
function and performance on the five cognitive domains. 
We additionally classified cognitive function of patients as cogni­
tively normal, cognitive deficits associated with level II Movement 
Disorder Society (MDS) criteria for PD-MCI [15] or cognitive features of 
probable PD-D [16] by comparing neuropsychological function with 
healthy norm groups (see eTable 1 of Supplementary Material 3). 
Exploratory outcomes included group differences in individual neuro­
psychological test scores, performance on the CT and AC games, and 
effects on psychiatric symptoms. No serious adverse events were ex­
pected from the interventions and assessments. We therefore only 
assessed adverse events related to impulse control disorders (including 
Internet addiction) for which patients with PD are at increased risk. 
3.1. Statistical methods 
Analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat population (i.e., 
all correctly enrolled and randomized participants). We used a multi­
variate linear mixed-model analysis to assess differences between 
groups on the primary outcome measure (ToL accuracy) with z-trans­
formed mean accuracy scores on task-load S1–S5 (modelled together) at 
T1 as multivariate outcome. We modelled standardized mean accuracy 
scores of these measures at T0 as covariates, condition as independent 
variable and a random intercept at participant level to correct for cor­
relation of the multiple variables within participants. In the intention-to- 
treat analysis, data of ten participants were missing due to failed 
assessment (n = 4), no follow-up (n = 2) or poor understanding (n = 4) 
for the primary outcome measure. As this proportion was very small 
(<5%), we performed the planned analysis without using multiple 
imputation. All analyses were repeated with adjustment for age, sex and 
years of education. 
We performed similar multivariate mixed-models to assess differ­
ences between groups on secondary and exploratory outcomes, i.e., 
differences on the ToL response time on S1–S5, subjective cognitive 
complaints, latent cognitive factors and psychiatric symptoms, using Z- 
scores. Latent cognitive factors were determined using regularized

maximum likelihood factor analysis (for a detailed description, see 
Supplementary Material 2) to compute individual scores on latent 
cognitive factors [17]. The effects of CT at six months follow-up were 
analyzed similarly to the above, but with time as an additional covariate 
in the mixed-model. Post-hoc, we modelled cognitive status – i.e., 
cognitively normal (PD-NC), PD-MCI, or PD-D – as an additional co­
variate in outcomes that showed CT-induced change, to assess differ­
ential training effects between subgroups. 
We analyzed the change in performance on the CT and AC games 
using multivariate mixed-model analyses and additionally assessed 
ceiling effects on the intervention by comparing six phases of training 
(for a detailed description, see Supplementary Material 2). 
We ran statistical analyses in SPSS version 26.0 (Armonk, NY, USA) 
using two-sided tests with α = 0.05 and performed factor analysis using 
the FMradio package in R (version 3.5.3) [18]. We did not correct for 
multiple comparisons in our primary and secondary analyses as these 
involved four multivariate models for separate pre-defined research 
questions. Exploratory analyses were separately corrected for multiple 
comparisons using the Benjamini & Hochberg false discovery rate (q <
0.05) [19]. During the trial the Clinical Research Bureau of Amsterdam 
UMC performed two data monitoring visits. 
The initial sample size calculation was based on a repeated-measures 
ANOVA corrected for a moderate correlation between pre- and post- 
intervention outcomes (r = 0.6) and an effect size f = 0.12 of CT on 
global cognitive function as reported in an earlier meta-analysis in PD 
patients [7]. Due to obscurity in the parameter definition in G*Power, 
we erroneously estimated the sample size needed to detect the effect 
(with α = 0.05 and β = 0.80) at n = 112. Unfortunately, after trial 
completion we discovered that this sample size is insufficient to detect 
the expected effect on global cognition (for details, see the Supple­
mentary Material 2). Based on our sample size (n = 136) and analysis 
method (revised from the initial planned analysis for higher sensitivity; 
linear mixed-model analysis with baseline covariate) the minimal effect 
size detectable in this study was f = 0.19, which should be sufficient to 
detect effects of CT on working memory (f = 0.31; [7]), and approaches 
earlier reported effects on executive function and processing speed (f =
0.15-f = 0.16). 
3.2. Role of the funding organization 
Two members of the Dutch Parkinson’s Disease Patient Association 
made a contribution to the design of the study. The funding bodies and 
Dezzel Media B.V. had no role in the collection, analysis, and interpre­
tation of data, writing the manuscript, or the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication. 
4. Results 
4.1. Participants 
We enrolled 140 patients with PD between September 15th, 2017 
and May 23rd, 2019 with six-month follow-up assessments until January 
29th, 2020. A flowchart is provided in Fig. 1. Four participants were 
wrongfully enrolled and excluded. One-hundred-and-thirty-six partici­
pants remained (mean age 62.9 ± 7.6 years; 39.7% female). 
Groups showed similar demographic and clinical characteristics 
(Table 1), except for small differences in sex distribution, education and 
baseline cognitive complaints. Compliance was excellent with the

majority of participants completing 100% of the intervention. Compared 
with healthy norm groups, the participants showed below average 
cognitive performance on attention and processing speed tasks, but 
normal for other cognitive domains (see Supplementary Material 3). 
5. Primary outcome 
The intention-to-treat analysis (reported below) showed similar re­
sults to the per-protocol sample (Supplementary Material 4–5). There 
was no difference between groups on ToL accuracy after training across 
all task-loads S1–S5 adjusted for baseline performance: B[SE]: −0.06 
[0.10], 95% CI: −0.27 to 0.15, p = 0.562 (crude model), or adjusted for 
baseline performance, age, sex and education level: B[SE]: −0.07 
[0.10], 95% CI: −0.28 to 0.14, p = 0.229 (adjusted model; see Fig. 2a). 
The groups also showed no significant differences on the individual ToL 
accuracy task-loads (see Table 2). 
6. Secondary outcomes 
Statistics on the secondary outcomes are depicted in Table 2. 
Multivariate analysis of the ToL response times across task loads S1–S5 
(n = 126) showed that the CT group was on average 0.17 standard de­
viation faster after training compared with the AC group: B[SE]: −0.17 
[0.10], 95% CI: −0.36 to 0.03, p = 0.087 (crude model); B[SE]: −0.12 
[0.10], 95% CI: −0.31 to 0.08, p = 0.232 (adjusted model). The CT 
group showed an improvement of 0.30 standard deviation (i.e., 1.5 s) on 
task-load S4 relative to the AC group: B[SE]: −0.30 [0.12], 95% CI: 
−0.55 to −0.06, p = 0.015 (crude model); B[SE]: −0.25 [0.12], 95% CI: 
−0.50 to 0.01, p = 0.042 (adjusted model; see Fig. 2b). Estimates of the 
other ToL task-loads indicated numerically similar but non-significant 
positive effects of CT compared with the AC. Subjective cognitive 
complaints (n = 133) showed no between-group differences. 
Factor analysis on all cognitive outcomes resulted in five latent 
factors, that represented episodic memory (F1), executive and visuo­
spatial function (F2), planning ability (F3), processing speed (F4), and 
attention and working memory (F5). After the intervention, there were 
no between-group differences on any of the factors (Table 2). Further 
details are reported in Supplementary Material 6. 
At six-months follow-up, no between-group differences were present 
(see Supplementary Material 11–13). 
6.1. Exploratory and post-hoc analyses 
Results on exploratory univariate analyses of individual neuropsy­
chological test outcomes are reported in Supplementary Material 7, and 
suggest improvement in the CT group on the Stroop Color-Word Test 
card II and III and improvement in the AC group on the Rey Complex 
Figure Test, that, however, did not survive correction for multiple 
comparisons. Exploratory analyses of improvement on the intervention 
games are provided in Supplementary Material 8–9. Participants 
improved significantly on the training in both conditions and on all 
separate training games. Comparison of six sequential phases of the 
training showed that the CT group no longer improved after phase IV, 
while the AC group no longer improved after phase I (eFigure 5). There 
was a significant association between improvement on the CT games and 
pre-to-post training change on the Stroop Color-Word Test card II and 
card III. Analyses of the effect of CT on psychiatric symptoms are re­
ported in Supplementary Material 10. 
Lastly, we performed post-hoc analyses of the differential effects of 
CT in separate cognitive diagnostic groups (PD-NC (n = 28), PD-MCI (n 
= 85) and PD-D (n = 23)). The differential effects are illustrated in Fig. 2 
(ToL outcomes) and eFigure 6 (Stroop Color-Word Test), and statistics 
are reported in Supplementary Material 14. Briefly, CT effects were 
largest in the PD-D group both after training and at six-months follow- 
up. 
7. Discussion 
In the COGTIPS double-blind RCT we assessed the efficacy of online, 
home-based, adaptive multi-domain cognitive training (CT) in the 
largest sample of PD patients to date. Our results showed no effect of 
eight-week CT on planning task accuracy (primary outcome) in PD pa­
tients, nor did CT improve subjective cognitive complaints. Secondary 
study outcomes showed tentative positive effects on measures of pro­
cessing speed during executive functioning that reached statistical sig­
nificance for ToL response time only. No effects were found in other 
cognitive domains and no CT effects were present at six-months follow- 
up. 
The negative results of this trial are in line with earlier aggregated 
findings of a Cochrane meta-analysis that described no clear evidence of 
CT on general cognitive function (and more specifically executive 
function) and activities of daily living in individuals with PD-MCI and 
PD-D [8]. While we a priori expected CT to primarily improve executive 
function, our study did not confirm this. In line with previous 
meta-analyses [7,8], we did observe tentative positive effects of CT on 
processing speed. However, this mental acceleration does not seem to

translate to daily function as patients in both conditions reported minor 
subjective improvement after the intervention, but without group dif­
ferences. Previous studies that assessed the effects of CT on subjective 
complaints in PD found small improvements [9,20] or null results 
[21–23]. The sensitivity of the PD-CFRS in measuring treatment effects – 
as opposed to its sensitivity to measuring clinically relevant cognitive 
decline [24,25] – has not yet been studied and our PD sample showed 
little variation in the total score at baseline. Limited transfer to ‘real-­
world’ cognitive function has previously been reported to be a short­
coming of CT and remains an important topic for future research [26]. 
At six-months follow-up the group differences on the ToL response time 
and Stroop Color-Word Test that were present after training had levelled 
out. As yet, this does not support two earlier smaller studies that 
assessed long-term CT effects [9,10]. 
The results of this clinical trial do not substantiate the use of CT (in its 
current form) in clinical practice. While we show that computerized CT 
is a highly feasible intervention, its effects do not transfer to everyday 
life. Effects of CT could be enhanced by individualization of training 
protocols, i.e., adjusting the training to the individuals’ impairments. 
Transfer may additionally be more viable when CT resembles everyday 
life situations, for example by using virtual reality training in­
terventions. This fast-developing technology is already being studied in 
psychiatric disorders [27,28] and may combine the easy administration 
and low cost of CT with ecological validity of cognitive rehabilitation. 
Tentative, targeted effects of CT on processing speed can additionally be 
enhanced by combining CT with aerobic or high intensity interval 
training [29,30], or neurostimulation [31]. Lastly, CT may be more 
effective for specific sub-populations within PD. Our post-hoc tests 
suggested larger CT effects in PD-D patients compared with PD-NC and 
PD-MCI patients. Earlier studies did not differentiate CT effects between 
PD-NC, PD-MCI or PD-D patients. Our results were contrary to our 
expectation that an intervention in early-stage PD – when compensatory 
neural mechanisms may still be able to counteract progressive PD pa­
thology – would be more efficacious [11], although we must stress that 
the PD-D sub-group was small, making these results less reliable. An 
explanation could also be that PD-NC participants performed at a ceiling 
level on cognitive tasks with little room to quantify improvement. 
7.1. Limitations and strengths 
The main limitation of this study was that we retrospectively 
discovered (i.e. after trial completion) that our sample size fell short of 
the intended statistical power (see Supplementary Material 2). Even 
though this study enrolled more than twice the participants compared 
with previously published computerized CT studies, we were under­
powered to detect effects on global cognitive function. Our study was 
adequately powered to detect effects on specific cognitive domains, 
however not including the executive function domain [7,8]. Secondly, 
our study did not include an additional waiting-list control group. 
Thirdly, despite our eligibility criterion to exclude PD patients with

of S1–S5 (A) and response time (B). *Indicates significant difference after training adjusted for baseline performance in the crude model. The lower panel shows 
results of the post-hoc analyses – the difference between intervention effects on the Tower of London (TOL) mean accuracy (C) and response time (D), separated for 
participants with normal cognition (PD-NC), PD-mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and PD dementia (PD-D). Data shown are observed means ± standard error.

severe cognitive impairments by using previously reported screening 
criteria on the MoCA for PD-D [12], still a substantial proportion of 
patients showed cognitive deficits associated with PD-D after applying 
the more elaborate diagnostic criteria. Lastly, we used the ToL as pri­
mary outcome and – although executive function that is measured with 
the ToL task is the most often reported (subjective) cognitive impair­
ment related to PD – this task focuses on only one of the cognitive do­
mains that can be affected by PD. Importantly, participants underwent 
short- and long-term extensive neuropsychological assessments that 
encompassed the full spectrum of cognitive function, thereby conform­
ing to the MDS Task Force guidelines [15,16], with additional assess­
ment of motor and non-motor symptoms. A major strength of our study 
was the randomized, double-blind controlled trial design with an 
adaptive CT with excellent intervention compliance and study protocol 
adherence. We performed a prospectively registered study, designed 
based on recommendations of earlier reviews [7,32]. 
8. Conclusions 
This randomized, double-blind controlled trial in a large sample of 
patients with PD showed that multi-domain CT did not improve accu­
racy on an executive function measure (primary outcome) or subjective 
cognitive complaints. We found tentative effects of CT on processing 
speed during executive functioning. The intervention was suitable for

showed large improvement on the training tasks. In its present form, 
however, eight-week computerized CT does not seem clinically appli­
cable due to the subtle and targeted improvement with no translation to 
everyday function. Future studies may investigate personalized or 
ecologically valid, multi-modal intervention methods to achieve clini­
cally meaningful and lasting effects.
