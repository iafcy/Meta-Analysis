            "abstract": "70 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease were randomly allocated to four groups: 17 patients received only social support, 18 cognitive training twice a week, in 17 cognitive training was combined with pyritinol 2 x 600 mg/day and in 18 cognitive training was combined with phosphatidylserine 2 x 200 mg/day. Treatment duration was 6 months. Before and after treatment, the patients underwent neuropsychological testing as well as measurement of the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose using positron emission tomography and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. Before treatment the groups were comparable in respect to resting and activated glucose pattern achieved by a visual recognition task. Electrophysiological changes were assessed as EEG power, globally and in 4 frequency bands. This 6-month study in four groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease indicated that phosphatidylserine treatment has an effect on different measures of brain function. Since neuropsychological improvements were best documented after 8 and 16 weeks and faded towards the end of the treatment period, it must be concluded that this symptomatic therapy is mainly of short-term benefit and was overcome by the progressive pathological changes at the end of the treatment period.\n",

The patients were divided into three groups: (1) those who received 3 weekly, 20-min sessions of IMIS in addition to 8 h/day of an integrated psychostimulation program (IPP); (2) those who received only IPP sessions; and (3) those who received only ChEI treatment. The primary outcome measure was the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog). Secondary outcome measures were: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Syndrom Kurztest, Boston Naming Test, Verbal Fluency, and the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test story recall subtest.\n## RESULTS\nAfter 12 weeks, the patients treated with both IMIS and IPP had improved outcome scores on the ADAS-Cog and MMSE, which was maintained through 24 weeks of follow-up. The patients treated with IPP alone had better outcome than those treated with ChEIs alone, but the effects were attenuated after 24 weeks. All patients had improved scores in all of the IMIS individual tasks, attaining higher levels of difficulty in all cases.\n## CONCLUSION\nAlthough both the IPP and IMIS improved cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease, the IMIS program provided an improvement above and beyond that seen with IPP alone, which lasted for 24 weeks.\n",

On 12 secondary outcome measures, most differences between the groups were not statistically significant. However, we observed a pattern in which effect sizes for verbal learning and memory measures tended to favor the intervention group whereas effect sizes for language and visuospatial function measures tended to favor the control group, which raises the possibility that these training programs may have domain-specific effects.

For this, we evaluated the efficacy of a 12-week computer-based memory-attention training program based on recognition in subjects with A-MCI and compared their performances with those of A-MCI controls trained in cognitively stimulating activities. The effect of training was assessed by comparing outcome measures in pre- and post-tests 15 days before and after training. To evaluate the duration of training benefits, a follow-up test session was performed 6 months after memory and attention training or cognitively stimulating activities. Outcome measures showed that the trained group, compared to control group, improved episodic recall and recognition. Six months after training, scores remained at the level of the post-test. Since the training program was exclusively based on recognition, our results showed a generalization from recognition to recall processes, which are memory components that represent part of the core cognitive impairments in individuals at risk of converting to AD. Thus, cognitive training based on recognition holds promise as a preventive therapeutic method and could be proposed as a non-pharmacological early-intervention strategy. Future investigations need to focus on methodological constraints and delineating possible neuroplastic mechanisms of action.\n",

USMART was completed or usual care was provided biweekly over a 4-week treatment period with a 2-week washout period between treatment periods. Primary outcome measures included the Word List Memory Test, Word List Recall Test (WLRT), and Word List Recognition Test.

Cognitive rehabilitation is a therapeutic approach designed to improve cognitive functioning after central nervous system's injuries. Computerized cognitive rehabilitation (CCR) uses multimedia and informatics resources to optimize cognitive compromised performances. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of pc cognitive training with Erica software in patients with stroke.\n## METHODS\nWe studied 35 subjects (randomly divided into 2 groups), affected by either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, having attended from January 2013 to May 2015 the Laboratory of Robotic and Cognitive Rehabilitation of Istituto di Ricerca e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Neurolesi in Messina. Cognitive dysfunctions were investigated through a complete neuropsychological battery, administered before (T0) and after (T1) each different training.\n## RESULTS\nAt T0, all the patients showed language and cognitive deficits, especially in attention process and memory abilities, with mood alterations. After the rehabilitation program (T1), we noted a global cognitive improvement in both groups, but a more significant increase in the scores of the different clinical scales we administered was found after CCR.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur data suggest that cognitive pc training by using the Erica software may be a useful methodology to increase the post-stroke cognitive recovery.\n",

In this study, we designed the first Chinese-version computer-based multi-model cognitive training for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Neuropsychological effects and neural activity changes assessed by functional MRI were both evaluated.\n## METHOD\nMCI patients in the training group were asked to take training 3-4 times per week for 6\u202fmonths. Neuropsychological and resting-state fMRI assessment were performed at baseline and at 6\u202fmonths. Patients in both groups were continuously followed up for another 12\u202fmonths and assessed by neuropsychological tests again.\n## RESULTS\n78 patients in the training group and 63 patients in the control group accomplished 6-month follow-up. Training group improved 0.23 standard deviation (SD) of mini-mental state examination, while control group had 0.5\u202fSD decline. Addenbrooke's cognitive examination-revised scores in attention (p\u202f=\u202f0.002) and memory (p\u202f=\u202f0.006), as well as stroop color-word test interference index (p\u202f=\u202f0.038) and complex figure test-copy score (p\u202f=\u202f0.035) were also in favor of the training effect. Difference between the changes of two groups after training was not statistically significant. The fMRI showed increased regional activity at bilateral temporal poles, insular cortices and hippocampus. However, difference between the changes of two groups after another 12\u202fmonths was not statistically significant.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nMulti-model cognitive training help MCI patients to gained cognition benefit, especially in memory, attention and executive function. Functional neuroimaging provided consistent neural activation evidence. Nevertheless, after one-year follow up after last training, training effects were not significant.
