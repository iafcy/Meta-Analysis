The neural bases of present distortions in time perception and temporal information processing still remain poorly understood. We reviewed: a) how the brain is capable of encoding time in different environments and multiple tasks, b) different models of interval timing, c) brain structures and neurotransmitters associated with time perception, d) the relationship between memory and time perception, e) neural mechanisms underlying different theories in neural and mental processes, and f) the relationship between different mental diseases and time perception. Bibliographic research was conducted based on publications over the past thirteen years written in English in the databases Scielo, Pubmed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge. The time perceptions research are executed to evaluate time perception in mental diseases and can provide evidence for future clinical applications."

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) reportedly regulate RNA splicing process.

Downregulation of L-DL in WT mice was achieved by AAV-mediated shRNA delivery, followed by memory-related behavioural tests. L-DL interactome was analysed by affinity-precipitation and mass spectrometry. Alternative RNA splicing was measured by RNA-seq and analyzed by bioinformatics-based approaches.

L-DL levels are decreased in the hippocampus of aged mouse brains and downregulation of L-DL impairs cognition in mice. L-DL serves as a structural component to recruit other speckle proteins, and regulates cytoskeleton- and synapse-related gene expression by altering RNA splicing. Mechanistically, these splicing changes are modulated via L-DL-mediated interaction of SF3B3, a core component of U2 snRNP, and U2AF65, a U2 spliceosome protein that guides U2 snRNP's binding to RNA. In addition, L-DL levels are decreased in APP/PS1 mouse brains.

            "abstract": "Background: It is becoming increasingly recognized that there is significant interneuron degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. As the hippocampus is integral for learning and memory, we performed a systematic review of primary literature focused on the relationship between Alzheimer's and hippocampal interneurons. In this study, we summarize the experimental work performed to date and identify opportunities for future experiments. Objectives: This PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)-style systematic review seeks to summarize the findings of all accessible research focused on cholecystokinin (CCK), neuropeptide Y (NPY), parvalbumin (PV), and somatostatin (SOM) interneurons in the hippocampal formation. Results: One thousand five hundred ninety-three articles were pulled from PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science, based on three blocks of search terms. There were 45 articles that met all the predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. There is strong evidence that PV interneurons are affected early in the disease by toxic amyloid beta (Aβ) fragments; SOM interneurons are affected indirectly while the SOM neuropeptide may act to slowly worsen toxic Aβ fragment accumulation, whereas NPY- and CCK-positive interneurons are affected later in the progression of the disease. Conclusions: Fewer studies have been performed on NPY and CCK interneurons, and there is room for further investigations regarding the role of PV interneurons in Alzheimer's to help resolve contradictory findings. This review found that PV interneurons are affected early in the disease, but only in Alzheimer's precursor protein but not tau models. NPY and CCK interneurons were found to be affected later in the disease, and SOM interneurons vary greatly. Future studies may consider reporting immunohistochemical studies inclusive of either cell location or morphology-as well as marker to give a more robust picture of the disease."

            "abstract": "Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are difficult to treat owing to the complexity of the brain and the presence of a natural blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the major progressive and currently incurable neurodegenerative disorders of the CNS, which accounts for 60-80% of cases of dementia. The pathophysiology of AD involves the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. Additionally, synaptic loss and imbalance of neuronal signaling molecules are characterized as important markers of AD. Existing treatments of AD help in the management of its symptoms and aim toward the maintenance of cognitive functions, behavior, and attenuation of gradual memory loss. Over the past decade, nonviral gene therapy has attracted increasing interest due to its various advantages over its viral counterparts. Moreover, advancements in nonviral gene technology have led to their increasing contributions in clinical trials. However, brain-targeted nonviral gene delivery vectors come across various extracellular and intracellular barriers, limiting their ability to transfer the therapeutic gene into the target cells. Chief barriers to nonviral gene therapy have been discussed briefly in this review. We have also highlighted the rapid advancement of several nonviral gene therapies for AD, which are broadly categorized into physical and chemical methods. These methods aim to modulate Aβ, beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), apolipoprotein E, or neurotrophic factors' expression in the CNS. Overall, this review discusses challenges and recent advancements of nonviral gene therapy for AD."

            "abstract": "LW-AFC is a new formula derived from the Liuwei Dihuang decoction, a classical traditional Chinese medicine prescription. Based on our research, LW-AFC is a promising drug for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The studies were conducted primarily in two typical AD mouse models: SAMP8 and APP/PS1 mice. The results showed that LW-AFC could improve many cognitive behaviors, such as spatial learning and memory ability, passive and active avoidance response, and object recognition memory capability. In addition, LW-AFC could also alleviate the AD-like pathology in animal models, such as neuron loss and Aβ deposition. Subsequent studies found that LW-AFC could rebalance hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, and modulate the disturbance of immune system and gut flora. These data suggested that the anti-AD effects of LW-AFC might be mainly via modulating the neuroendocrine immunomodulation (NIM) network. As inhibiting the immune function by immunosuppressant could abolish the protective effects of LW-AFC against long-term potentiation (LTP) impairment model, it is likely that LW-AFC balancing the NIM network is initiated by modulating the immune system."

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Since it was shown that ProSAP2/Shank3 scaffold assembly within the PSD is Zn2+-dependent and that the amyloid beta protein (Aβ) is able to bind Zn2+, we hypothesize that sequestration of Zn2+ ions by Aβ contributes to ProSAP/Shank platform malformation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      To test this hypothesis, we designed multiple in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrating ProSAP/Shank dysregulation in rat hippocampal cultures following Aβ oligomer accumulation. These changes were independent from alterations on ProSAP/Shank transcriptional level. However, application of soluble Aβ prevented association of Zn2+ ions with ProSAP2/Shank3 in a cell-based assay and decreased the concentration of Zn2+ clusters within dendrites. Zn2+ supplementation or saturation of Aβ with Zn2+ ions prior to cell treatment was able to counter the effects induced by Aβ on synapse density and ProSAP2/Shank3 levels at the PSD. Interestingly, intracellular Zn2+ levels in APP-PS1 mice and human AD hippocampus are reduced along with a reduction in synapse density and synaptic ProSAP2/Shank3 and Shank1 protein levels.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We conclude that sequestration of Zn2+ ions by Aβ significantly contributes to changes in ProSAP2/Shank3 platforms.

Objective: This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of reminiscence using immersive virtual reality (iVR reminiscence) focusing on anxiety that often appears with cognitive decline. The secondary objective is to reveal the preference for VR image types for reminiscence: live-action (LA) or computer graphics (CG). Methods: This was a pilot, open-label, and randomized crossover study which was conducted on January 2020 at a single nursing home. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups (A or B) in equal numbers, and they alternately viewed two types of VR images (LA and CG) themed on the mid- to late Showa era (A.D. 1955-1980) in Japan. In group A, the CG images were viewed first, and then the LA images were viewed (CG→ LA). In group B, the images were viewed in the opposite order (LA→ CG). Before VR viewing, subjects responded to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Japanese version and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Japanese version. After viewing the first and second VR, subjects responded to STAI and the numerical rating scale (NRS) for satisfaction and side effects (nausea, dizziness, headache, and tiredness). Results: Ten subjects participated in this study. The values of analyses are presented in the mean (SD). The age was 87.1 years (4.2), and the MMSE was 28.5 (1.8). The total STAI score before VR viewing was 36.1 (7.2), but it significantly decreased to 26.8 (4.9) after the first VR viewing (P = 0.0010), and further decreased to 23.4 (2.8) after the second VR viewing (P < 0.001). The NRS score for satisfaction tended to be higher after viewing LA in group A (CG→ LA) (CG vs. LA; 7.0 (2.3) vs. 8.6 (1.5), P = 0.0993), while in group B (LA→ CG), the score after CG was slightly lower than that after LA. There were no serious side effects. Conclusions: This study suggests that iVR reminiscence can reduce anxiety in the oldest-old without causing serious side effects.

Using memory-driven reinforcement learning and deep neural networks, we developed a model that learns to navigate autonomously in biologically realistic virtual reality environments based on raw camera inputs alone. Neither is context represented explicitly in our model, nor is context change signaled. We find that memory-intact agents learn distinct context representations, and develop ABA renewal, whereas memory-impaired agents do not. These findings reproduce the behavior of control and hippocampal animals, respectively. We therefore propose that the role of the hippocampus in the context-dependence of extinction learning might stem from its function in episodic-like memory and not in context-representation per se.

            "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondrial functions are altered in AD and play an important role in AD pathogenesis. It has been established that H2S homeostasis is balanced in AD. The emerging mitochondrial roles of H2S include antioxidation, antiapoptosis, and the modulation of cellular bioenergetics. Here, using primary neurons from the well-characterized APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model, we studied the effects of AP39 (a newly synthesized mitochondrially targeted H2S donor) on mitochondrial function. AP39 increased intracellular H2S levels, mainly in mitochondrial regions. AP39 exerted dose-dependent effects on mitochondrial activity in APP/PS1 neurons, including increased cellular bioenergy metabolism and cell viability at low concentrations (25-100 nM) and decreased energy production and cell viability at a high concentration (250 nM). Furthermore, AP39 (100 nM) increased ATP levels, protected mitochondrial DNA, and decreased ROS generation. AP39 regulated mitochondrial dynamics, shifting from fission toward fusion. After 6 weeks, AP39 administration to APP/PS1 mice significantly ameliorated their spatial memory deficits in the Morris water maze and NORT and reduced Aβ deposition in their brains. Additionally, AP39 inhibited brain atrophy in APP/PS1 mice. Based on these results, AP39 was proposed as a promising drug candidate for AD treatment, and its anti-AD mechanism may involve protection against mitochondrial damage."

Only papers written in English or Dutch were considered. All full-text papers about cognitive screening instruments for the early detection of AD were included, resulting in the identification of 38 pencil and paper tests and 12 computer tests. In a second step, the psychometric quality of these instruments was evaluated. Therefore, the same databases were searched again to identify papers that described the psychometric properties of the instruments meanwhile applying diagnostic criteria for the diagnostic groups included.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Out of 1454 papers, 96 clearly discussed the psychometric properties of the instruments. Eighty-nine papers discussed pencil and paper tests of which 80 were validated in a memory clinic setting. Based on the number of studies (31 articles) and the sensitivity (84%) and specificity (74%) values, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) seems to be a promising (pencil and paper) screening test for memory clinic testing as well as for population screening. Regarding computer tests, validation studies were only available for 7 out of 12 tests.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A large number of screening tests for AD are available. However, most tests are only validated in a memory clinic setting and description of the psychometric properties of the instruments is limited. Especially, computer tests require further research. The MoCA is a promising instrument, but the specificity to detect early AD is rather low."

Low cognitive and brain reserve and limited cognitive stimulation are associated with increased risk of dementia. Emerging evidence now suggests that subtle cognitive changes, detectable years before criteria for mild cognitive impairment are met, may be predictive of future dementia. Important for intervention and reduction in disease risk, research also suggests that engaging in stimulating mental activity throughout adulthood builds cognitive and brain reserve and reduces dementia risk. Therefore, midlife (defined here as 40 to 65 years) may be a suitable time to introduce cognitive interventions for maintaining cognitive function and, in the longer term, possibly preventing or delaying the onset of clinical dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effects of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks for maintaining or improving cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in midlife.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched up to 31 March 2018 in ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG). We ran additional searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP at www.apps.who.int/trialsearch, to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and as up-to-date as possible, to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs, published or unpublished, reported in any language. Participants were cognitively healthy people between 40 and 65 years of age (80% of study population within this age range). Experimental interventions adhered to the following criteria: intervention was any form of interactive computerised cognitive intervention - including computer exercises, computer games, mobile devices, gaming console, and virtual reality - that involved repeated practice on standardised exercises of specified cognitive domain(s) for the purpose of enhancing cognitive function; duration of the intervention was at least 12 weeks; cognitive outcomes were measured; and cognitive training interventions were compared with active or inactive control interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      For preliminary screening of search results, we used a 'crowd' method to identify RCTs. At least two review authors working independently screened remaining citations against inclusion criteria; independently extracted data; and assessed the quality of the included trial, using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. We used GRADE to describe the overall quality of the evidence.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified one eligible study that examined the effect of computerised cognitive training (CCT) in 6742 participants over 50 years of age, with training and follow-up duration of six months. We considered the study to be at high risk of attrition bias and the overall quality of the evidence to be low.Researchers provided no data on our primary outcome. Results indicate that there may be a small advantage for the CCT group for executive function (mean difference (MD) -1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.85 to -1.29; participants = 3994; low-quality evidence) and a very small advantage for the control group for working memory (MD 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.15; participants = 5831; low-quality evidence). The intervention may have had little or no effect on episodic memory (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.04; participants = 3090; low-quality evidence).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found low-quality evidence from only one study. We are unable to determine whether computerised cognitive training is effective in maintaining global cognitive function among healthy adults in midlife. We strongly recommend that high-quality studies be undertaken to investigate the effectiveness and acceptability of cognitive training in midlife, using interventions that last long enough that they may have enduring effects on cognitive and brain reserve, and with investigators following up long enough to assess effects on clinically important outcomes in later life."

Technology offers an opportunity for remote assessment, from telephone/video-based consultations to fully digitised cognitive assessments with potential to track disease progression. Whilst many acute services utilise remote assessment, there are perceived barriers in memory clinic populations. However, COVID-19 and related national restrictions may have altered patients' attitudes towards and experience with remote assessment tools. We aimed to investigate attitudes including confidence and perceived challenges towards remote assessment as well as access and experience with technology amongst Oxfordshire memory clinic patients.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Between June and September 2020, all patients awaiting initial memory clinic assessment were asked to participate in a standardised semi-quantitative survey as part of an Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust service evaluation. Designed with service-user input, questions aimed to capture availability, experience and confidence using technology and patients' comfort with assessment, diagnosis and future care discussions being conducted remotely, as well as any concerns or comments.\n    \n\n\n          Result:\n        \n      \n      Amongst 73 respondents (average age=79.1 years), access to technology was high; 82% reported telephone access and 58% to a laptop, tablet, smartphone or combination of the three. 17% reported previous use of web-based video conferencing tools, and although confidence using these tools was 7%, this increased with written instruction or relative assistance. Similarly, whilst under half of the respondents felt comfortable with assessments, diagnosis or future care discussions occurring remotely, this increased to approximately two thirds with relative presence (67%, 69% and 66%, respectively). Qualitative analysis of patient's comments regarding remote assessment also revealed concerns over wait times/urgent need for assessment. However, 62% preferred to wait for an in-person visit, rather than an immediate remote appointment.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This survey demonstrates availability of technology in this population but a disparity in willingness to engage in remote assessment. Consequently, there is a need to diverge from one-size-fits-all models to a tiered approach that helps facilitate individual choice based on the availability/confidence with technology and level of relative support. The Oxford Brain Health Centre, an integrated clinical-research service, provides an opportunity to research this tiered approach in clinical practice."

It is also used as self-help by tens of millions of people each year. Clinical EFT, the manualized form of the method, has been validated as an \"evidence-based\" practice using criteria published by the American Psychological Association (APA) Division 12 Task Force on Empirically Validated Therapies. Its three essential ingredients are exposure, cognitive framing, and acupressure.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      In 2013 we published a paper defining Clinical EFT and reviewing published research.

Here we update our findings based on subsequently published literature and propose directions for future research.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses. Retrieval of 4,167 results resulted in the identification of 56 RCTs (n = 2,013), 41 of which were published subsequent to our earlier review, as well as eight meta-analyses.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      RCTs have found EFT treatment to be effective for (a) psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression, phobias, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); (b) physiological issues such as pain, insomnia, and autoimmune conditions; (c) professional and sports performance; and (d) biological markers of stress. Meta-analyses evaluating the effect of EFT treatment have found it to be \"moderate\" to \"large.\" Successful independent replication studies have been carried out for anxiety, depression, PTSD, phobias, sports performance, and cortisol levels. We outline the next steps in EFT research. These include determining its impact on cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive impairment; analysis of the large-scale datasets made possible by mobile apps; and delivery through channels such as virtual practitioner sessions, artificial intelligence agents, online courses, apps, virtual reality platforms, and standardized group therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Subsequent research has confirmed the conclusions of earlier studies. These find Clinical EFT to be efficacious for a range of psychological and physiological conditions. Comparatively few treatment sessions are required, treatment is effective whether delivered in person or virtually, and symptom improvements persist over time. Treatment is associated with measurable biological effects in the dimensions of gene expression, brain synchrony, hormonal synthesis, and a wide range of biomarkers. Clinical EFT is a stable and mature method with an extensive evidence base. Its use in primary care settings as a safe, rapid, reliable, and effective treatment for both psychological and medical diagnoses continues to grow."

A revisit of the work already undertaken by Kaplan and colleagues using the Boston Process-Approach provides a solid basis for identifying new opportunities to capture data on neurocognitive processes, test-taking strategies and response styles. Thus, this critical review will combine traditional process-based assessment strategies with support provided or offered by newer technologies that have the potential to add value to data collection and interpretation. There is now considerable interest in neuropsychological test administration using computer/digital technology, both in research and in clinical settings. To add value, any computerized version of an existing cognitive test should respect the administration procedure for which normative data were obtained, should be time-saving in terms of scoring and interpretation, and should, we argue, facilitate gathering information about the processes and strategies followed in test completion. This article will offer an overview of the steps needed when implementing computerization of neuropsychological tests using a Process-Based Approach (PBA) to these technology-based adaptations and will discuss further developments in this area by linking it to future technological developments that may be possible in the area of neuropsychological assessment. Additionally, an overview of neuropsychological tests that may benefit from computerization will be presented, together with suggestions on the specific processes, strategies and features that may be captured with the aid of such computerization. Finally, hypotheses on how virtual reality could be an asset for the future of the PBA to neuropsychological assessment will also be discussed."

One of the well-known pathological markers of AD is the accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (Aβ), and its plaques, in the brain. Recent studies using Tg-5XFAD mice as a model of AD have reported that exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) from cellular phones reduced Aβ plaques in the brain and showed beneficial effects on AD. In this study, we examined whether exposure to 1950 MHz RF-EMF affects Aβ processing in neural cells. We exposed HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells and SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells to RF-EMF (SAR 6 W/kg) for 2 h per day for 3 days, and analyzed the mRNA and protein expression of the key genes related to Aβ processing. When exposed to RF-EMF, mRNA levels of APP, BACE1, ADAM10 and PSEN1 were decreased in HT22, but the mRNA level of APP was not changed in SH-SY5Y cells. The protein expression of APP and BACE1, as well as the secreted Aβ peptide, was not significantly different between RF-EMF-exposed 7w-PSML, HT22 and SH-SY5Y cells and the unexposed controls. These observations suggest that RF-EMF exposure may not have a significant physiological effect on Aβ processing of neural cells in the short term. However, considering that we only exposed HT22 and SH-SY5Y cells to RF-EMF for 2 h per day for 3 days, we cannot exclude the possibility that 1950 MHz RF-EMF induces physiological change in Aβ processing with long-term and continuous exposure."

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and multiple cognitive impairments. Current healthcare costs for over 50 million people afflicted with AD are about $818 million and are projected to be $2 billion by 2050. Unfortunately, there are no drugs currently available that can delay and/or prevent the progression of disease in elderly individuals and in AD patients. Loss of synapses and synaptic damage are largely correlated with cognitive decline in AD patients. Women are at a higher lifetime risk of developing AD encompassing two-thirds of the total AD afflicted population. Only about 1-2% of total AD patients can be explained by genetic mutations in APP, PS1, and PS2 genes. Several risk factors have been identified, such as Apolipoprotein E4 genotype, type 2 diabetes, traumatic brain injury, depression, and hormonal imbalance, are reported to be associated with late-onset AD. Strong evidence reveals that antioxidant enriched diets and regular exercise reduces toxic radicals, enhances mitochondrial function and synaptic activity, and improves cognitive function in elderly populations. Current available data on the use of antioxidants in mouse models of AD and antioxidant(s) supplements in diets of elderly individuals were investigated. The use of antioxidants in randomized clinical trials in AD patients was also critically assessed. Based on our survey of current literature and findings, we cautiously conclude that healthy diets, regular exercise, and improved lifestyle can delay dementia progression and reduce the risk of AD in elderly individuals and reverse subjects with mild cognitive impairment to a non-demented state."

            "abstract": "Classically, cognitive deficits have been studied and treated in isolation from each other. A stroke patient is classified as being memory impaired, having executive dysfunction or showing attentional deficits after which a dedicated rehabilitation therapy is given. Studies seldom looked at the relationship between these different cognitive domains and syndromes, although, there is evidence that they might share common neuronal substrates and do not occur in isolation. Here, we propose a novel rehabilitation method in virtual reality to treat cognitive deficits in conjunction and report the preliminary results of an ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial. The current results suggest that in a homogeneous patient group the cognitive deficits are correlated and that the individual impairment level can be optimally addressed through an adaptive training paradigm."

            "abstract": "Increased APP (amyloid precursor protein) processing causes β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it is unclear if it also affects sporadic Aβ accumulation. We tested healthy controls and patients with mild cognitive symptoms (N=331) in the BioFINDER study, using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ40 as a surrogate for amyloidogenic APP processing. We find that levels of brain Aβ fibrils (measured by 18F-flutemetamol PET) are independently associated with high CSF Aβ40 (P<0.001) and APOE ɛ4 (P<0.001). The association between CSF Aβ40 and brain Aβ is stronger in APOE ɛ4-negative than in positive people (P=0.0080). The results are similar for CSF Aβ38 and for a combination of CSF Aβ38 and CSF Aβ40. In conclusion, sporadic Aβ accumulation may be partly associated with increased amyloidogenic APP production, especially in APOE ɛ4-negative subjects. The risk for sporadic AD may consequently depend on increased Aβ production, in addition to decreased Aβ clearance."

In total, eleven articles were identified using frozen blueberry (n = 4 studies), blueberry concentrate (n = 2), beverage (n = 3), capsule (n = 1), extract and powder (n = 1). These studies had been performed among older people with no recognized cognitive impairment or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The primary outcomes included global cognitive function, psychomotor function, learning and memory, working memory capacity, executive functions, and brain perfusion/activity. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of available clinical trials on the effects of berry-based supplements and foods on cognitive performances as well as brain perfusion parameters among the elderly with normal cognition or MCI. Existing evidence concludes that berry-based supplements and foods have beneficial effects on resting brain perfusion, cognitive function, memory performance, executive functioning, processing speed, and attention indices."

Three groups of animals: 5-, 12- and 18-24-month old were subjected to both Water Maze training and the IntelliCage-based appetitive conditioning. The spatial memory deficit was observed in all three groups of transgenic mice in both behavioral paradigms. However, the APP mice were capable to learn normally when co-housed with the wild-type (WT) littermates, in contrast to clearly impaired learning observed when the transgenic mice were housed alone. Furthermore, in the transgenic mice kept in the Intellicage alone, the cognitive deficit of the young animals was modulated by the circadian rhythm, namely was prominent only during the active phase of the day. The novel approach to study the transgenic mice cognitive abilities presented in this paper offers new insight into cognitive dysfunctions of the Alzheimer's disease mouse model."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Dual tasking constitutes a large portion of most activities of daily living; in real-life situations, people need to not only maintain balance and mobility skills, but also perform other cognitive or motor tasks at the same time. Interest toward dual-task training (DTT) is increasing as traditional interventions may not prepare patients to adequately face the challenges of most activities of daily living. These usually involve simultaneous cognitive and motor tasks, and they often show a decline in performance. Cognitive-motor interference (CMI) has been investigated in different neurological populations, but limited evidence is present for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). The use of computerized tools is mandatory to allow the application of more standardized assessment and rehabilitation intervention protocols and easier implementation of multicenter and multilanguage studies.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To describe the design and development of CMI-APP, an adaptive and interactive technology tablet-based app, and to present the preliminary results of a multicenter pilot study involving people with MS performed in several European centers for evaluating the feasibility of and adherence to a rehabilitation program based on CMI-APP.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      CMI-APP includes user-friendly interfaces for personal data input and management, assessment of CMI, and DTT. A dedicated team developed CMI-APP for Android tablets above API level 14 (version 4.0), using C# as the programming language and Unity and Visual Studio as development tools. Three cognitive assessment tests for working memory, information processing speed, and sustained attention and four motor assessment tests for walking at different difficulty levels were implemented. Dual cognitive-motor tasks were performed by combining single cognitive and motor tasks. CMI-APP implements exercises for DTT involving the following 12 cognitive functions: sustained attention, text comprehension, verbal fluency, auditory discrimination, visual discrimination, working memory, information processing speed, auditory memory, visual memory, verbal analog reasoning, visual analog reasoning, and visual spatial planning, which can be performed during walking or stepping on the spot. Fifteen people with MS (mean age 52.6, SD 8.6 years; mean disease duration 9.4, SD 8.4 years; mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score 3.6, SD 1.1) underwent DTT (20 sessions). Adherence to the rehabilitation program was evaluated according to the percentage of performed sessions, perceived exertion during the training (Borg 15-point Ratings of Perceived Exertion [RPE] Scale), and subjective experience of the training (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory [IMI]).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The adherence rate was 91%. DTT was perceived as \"somewhat difficult\" (mean RPE Scale score 12.6, SD 1.9). IMI revealed that participants enjoyed the training and felt that it was valuable and, to some extent, important, without feelings of pressure. They felt competent, although they did not always feel they could choose the exercises, probably because the therapist chose the exercises and many exercises had few difficulty levels.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      CMI-APP is safe, highly usable, motivating, and well accepted for DTT by people with MS. The findings are fundamental for the preparation of future large-sample studies examining CMI and the effectiveness of DTT interventions with CMI-APP in people with MS."

Therefore, the demand for remote-care is increasing. We hypothesized that immersive virtual reality (iVR) could be used more effectively than conventional reminiscence for anxiety. We first examined the effectiveness and safety of reminiscence using iVR (iVR reminiscence session) in patients with MCI. After COVID-19 imposed restriction on visiting nursing homes, we conducted online iVR reminiscence session (remote iVR reminiscence session) and compared its effectiveness with that of interpersonal iVR reminiscence session (face-to-face iVR reminiscence session). The results of two elderly with MCI suggested that iVR reminiscence could reduce anxiety and the burden of care without serious side effects. The effects of remote iVR reminiscence might be almost as effective as those of face-to-face one."

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, irreversible brain disorder, no effective cure for it till now. However, available medicines can delay its progress. Therefore, the early detection of AD plays a crucial role in preventing and controlling its progression. The main objective is to design an end-to-end framework for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and medical image classification for various AD stages. A deep learning approach, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), is used in this work. Four stages of the AD spectrum are multi-classified. Furthermore, separate binary medical image classifications are implemented between each two-pair class of AD stages. Two methods are used to classify the medical images and detect AD. The first method uses simple CNN architectures that deal with 2D and 3D structural brain scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset based on 2D and 3D convolution. The second method applies the transfer learning principle to take advantage of the pre-trained models for medical image classifications, such as the VGG19 model. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult for people to go to hospitals periodically to avoid gatherings and infections. As a result, Alzheimer's checking web application is proposed using the final qualified proposed architectures. It helps doctors and patients to check AD remotely. It also determines the AD stage of the patient based on the AD spectrum and advises the patient according to its AD stage. Nine performance metrics are used in the evaluation and the comparison between the two methods. The experimental results prove that the CNN architectures for the first method have the following characteristics: suitable simple structures that reduce computational complexity, memory requirements, overfitting, and provide manageable time. Besides, they achieve very promising accuracies, 93.61% and 95.17% for 2D and 3D multi-class AD stage classifications. The VGG19 pre-trained model is fine-tuned and achieved an accuracy of 97% for multi-class AD stage classifications."

Though it is not yet curable or reversible, research has shown that clinical intervention or intensive cognitive training at an early stage may effectively delay the progress of the disease. As a result, screening populations with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early AD via efficient, effective and low-cost cognitive assessments is important. Currently, a cognitive assessment relies mostly on cognitive tests, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), which must be performed by therapists. Also, cognitive functions can be divided into a variety of dimensions, such as memory, attention, executive function, visual spatial and so on. Executive functions (EF), also known as executive control or cognitive control, refer to a set of skills necessary to perform higher-order cognitive processes, including working memory, planning, attention, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control. Along with the fast progress of virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI), this study proposes an intelligent assessment method aimed at assessing executive functions. Utilizing machine learning to develop an automatic evidence-based assessment model, behavioral information is acquired through performing executive-function tasks in a VR supermarket. Clinical trials were performed individuals with MCI or early AD and six healthy participants. Statistical analysis showed that 45 out of 46 indices derived from behavioral information were found to differ significantly between individuals with neurocognitive disorder and healthy participants. This analysis indicates these indices may be potential bio-markers. Further, machine-learning methods were applied to build classifiers that differentiate between individuals with MCI or early AD and healthy participants. The accuracy of the classifier is up to 100%, demonstrating the derived features from the VR system were highly related to diagnosis of individuals with MCI or early AD."

We tested the hypothesis that experimentally induced increments of subjective responsibility would lead to a disproportionately strong decline of memory confidence and enhanced response latencies in OCD while leaving memory accuracy unaffected. Twenty-eight OCD patients and 28 healthy controls were presented a computerized memory test framed with two different scenarios. In the neutral scenario, the participant was requested to imagine purchasing 15 items from a do-it-yourself store. In the recognition phase, the 15 needed items were presented along with 15 distractor items. The participant was asked to decide whether items were on his or her shopping list or not, graded by subjective confidence. In the responsibility scenario, the general experimental setup was analogous except that the participant now had to envision that he or she was a helper in a region recently struck by an earthquake, dispatched to provide 15 urgently needed goods from a nearby town. In line with prior work by our group, samples did not differ in either condition on memory accuracy in a subsequent recognition task. As hypothesized, OCD participants were less certain in their responses for the high responsibility condition than controls. Whereas patients and controls did not differ in their subjective estimates for memorized items, patients expressed stronger doubt that their earthquake mission was successful. The findings indicate that low memory confidence in OCD may only be elicited in situations where perceived responsibility is high and that patients may share higher performance standards (\"good is not good enough\") than controls when perceived responsibility is inflated."

            "abstract": "Background: People with Down Syndrome (DS) are born with an extra copy of Chromosome (Chr) 21 and many of these individuals develop Alzheimer's Disease (AD) when they age. This is due at least in part to the extra copy of the APP gene located on Chr 21. By 40 years, most people with DS have amyloid plaques which disrupt brain cell function and increase their risk for AD. About half of the people with DS develop AD and the associated dementia around 50 to 60 years of age, which is about the age at which the hereditary form of AD, early onset AD, manifests. In the absence of Chr 21 trisomy, duplication of APP alone is a cause of early onset Alzheimer's disease, making it likely that having three copies of APP is important in the development of AD and in DS. Methods: We investigate the relationship between AD and DS through integrative analysis of genesets derived from a MeSH query of AD and DS associated beta amyloid peptides, Chr 21, GWAS identified AD risk factor genes, and differentially expressed genes in individuals with DS. Results: Unique and shared aspects of each geneset were evaluated based on functional enrichment analysis, transcription factor profile and network interactions. Genes that may be important to both disorders in the context of direct association with APP processing, Tau post translational modification and network connectivity are ACSM1, APBA2, APLP1, BACE2, BCL2L, COL18A1, DYRK1A, IK, KLK6, METTL2B, MTOR, NFE2L2, NFKB1, PRSS1, QTRT1, RCAN1, RUNX1, SAP18 SOD1, SYNJ1, S100B. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation and immune system processes likely contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and DS which is consistent with other published reports."

No approved treatments exist for age-related cognitive decline. Computerized cognitive training has been shown to provide consistent albeit modest improvements in cognitive function as measured by neuropsychological testing. Vortioxetine, an antidepressant medication, has putative procognitive and proneuroplastic properties and therefore may be able to augment cognitive training. In this placebo-controlled study, the authors tested the cognitive benefits of vortioxetine added to cognitive training for adults age 65 or older with age-related cognitive decline.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      After a 2-week lead-in period of cognitive training, 100 participants were randomly assigned to receive either vortioxetine or placebo in addition to cognitive training for 26 weeks.

An AB with follow up single case design was repeated across five participants to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of CCT on subjective memory in patients with stroke. Target behaviour was subjective everyday and prospective memory failures which were assessed weekly. Following baseline (three weeks), participants completed six weeks of LumosityTM training in their homes. Data were analysed visually and statistically. The frequency of prospective memory failures decreased during intervention for one participant, while the frequency of prospective and everyday memory failures decreased significantly during the follow up period for another participant. Yet, significantly more everyday and prospective memory failures were reported following training by one study participant. No significant change in subjective memory ratings was found for remaining participants. Regarding secondary outcomes, meaningful changes on objective measures of memory were not observed, despite considerable inter-individual variability. Three participants reported improvement in individualised memory goals, while two participants described a decline. Overall, LumosityTM training appears feasible; however, no consistent evidence to support effectiveness of this CCT on subjective or objective memory was found."

            "abstract": "The failure of clinical trials largely focused on mild to moderate stages of Alzheimer disease has suggested to the scientific community that the effectiveness of Amyloid-β (Aβ)-centered treatments should be evaluated starting as early as possible, well before irreversible brain damage has occurred. Accordingly, also the preclinical development of new therapies should be carried out taking into account this suggestion. In the present investigation we evaluated the efficacy of a treatment with liposomes multifunctionalized for crossing the blood-brain barrier and targeting Aβ, carried out on young APP/PS1 Tg mice, taken as a model of pre-symptomatic disease stage. Liposomes were administered once a week to Tg mice for 7months, starting at the age of 5months and up to the age of 12 when they display AD-like cognitive and brain biochemical/anatomical features. The treatment prevented the onset of the long-term memory impairment and slowed down the deposition of brain Aβ; at anatomical level, prevented both ventricle enlargement and entorhinal cortex thickness reduction, otherwise occurring in untreated mice. Strikingly, these effects were maintained 3months after treatment discontinuation. An increase of Aβ levels in the liver was detected at the end of the treatment, then followed also by reduction of brain Amyloid Precursor Protein and increase of Aβ-degrading enzymes. These results suggest that the treatment promotes brain Aβ clearance by a peripheral 'sink' effect and ultimately affects Aβ turnover in the brain. Worth of note, the treatment was apparently not toxic for all the organs analyzed, in particular for brain, as suggested by the lower brain TNF-α and MDA levels, and by higher level of SOD activity in treated mice. Together, these findings promote a very early treatment with multi-functional liposomes as a well-tolerated nanomedicine-based approach, potentially suitable for a disease-modifying therapy of AD, able to delay or prevent relevant features of the disease."

Nowadays, rehabilitation is considered to be the most effective nonpharmacological approach to reduce risk of falls. Using paradigms in virtual reality (VR) is a promising tool in neurorehabilitation because of the potential improvement in motor learning and improvement in daily functioning by replicating everyday real-life scenarios. Objective: To identify the most prevalent everyday situations which impair gait in PD that could be simulated in virtual reality (VR) environment. Methods: A newly developed self-report questionnaire consisting of 15 binary response items (YES/NO) encompassing everyday walking situations was administered to 62 patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD according to MDS Clinical Diagnostic Criteria. We included patients able to walk unassisted for at least 10 min and without significant cognitive impairment. Mokken Scale Analysis was used to evaluate psychometric properties of the scale. Results: Questionnaires from 58 patients were analyzed (31 men, age = 63 ± 9.9 y, disease duration = 7.02 ± 4.03 y, LEDD = 1115 ± 549.4 mg, H&Y = 2.4 ± 0.6). Only 10 items (out of 15) were identified as scalable and these were included in Gait Disorders Questionnaire (GDQ). The most prevalent trigger of gait disorders was walking under time pressure, followed by gait in crowded places and walking while dual-tasking. The total score of GDQ significantly correlated with the disease duration (r s = 0.347, p = 0.008) and modified H&Y staging (r s = 0.288, p = 0.028). Conclusion: With the use of GDQ we identified the most prevalent everyday transition activities that provoke gait disorders in patients with PD. The results may be useful for further development and systematic application of VR paradigms for physiotherapy of PD patients."

Various applications, often based on virtual reality, have been implemented to carry out psychological assessments and interventions, using innovative human-machine interaction systems. In this context, the LEAP Motion sensing technology has raised interest, since it allows for more natural interactions with digital contents, via an optical tracking of hand and finger movements. Recent research has considered LEAP Motion features in virtual-reality-based systems, to meet specific needs of different clinical populations, varying in age and type of disorder. The present paper carried out a systematic mini-review of the available literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The inclusion criteria were (i) publication date between 2013 and 2020, (ii) being an empirical study or project report, (iii) written in English or Italian languages, (iv) published in a scholarly peer-reviewed journal and/or conference proceedings, and (v) assessing LEAP Motion intervention for four specific psychological domains (i.e., autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dementia, and mild cognitive impairment), objectively. Nineteen eligible empirical studies were included. Overall, results show that protocols for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder can promote psychomotor and psychosocial rehabilitation in contexts that stimulate learning. Moreover, virtual reality and LEAP Motion seem promising for the assessment and screening of functional abilities in dementia and mild cognitive impairment. As evidence is, however, still limited, deeper investigations are needed to assess the full potential of the LEAP Motion technology, possibly extending its applications. This is relevant, considering the role that virtual reality could have in overcoming barriers to access assessment, therapies, and smart monitoring."

Although computerized neurocognitive testing has been shown to be sensitive to cognitive deficits after SRC, and some blood biomarkers have shown promise as indicators of axonal and glial damage, the potential utility of these measures in isolation and combination for assisting SRC diagnosis and tracking recovery is not well understood. To provide new insights, we conducted a prospective study of 64 male and female professional flat-track jockeys (49 non-SRC, 15 SRC), with each jockey undergoing symptom evaluation, cognitive testing using the CogSport battery, and serum biomarker quantification of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), tau, and neurofilament light (NfL) using a Simoa HD-X Analyzer. Measures were performed at baseline (i.e., pre-injury), and 2 and 7 days and 1 and 12 months after SRC. Symptoms were most pronounced at 2 days and had largely resolved by either 7 days or 1 month. CogSport testing at 2 days revealed cognitive impairments relative to both non-concussed peers and their own pre-injury baselines, with SRC classification utility found at 2 days, and to a slightly lesser extent, at 7 days. Relatively prolonged changes in serum NfL were observed, with elevated levels and classification utility persisting beyond the resolution of SRC symptoms and cognitive deficits. Finally, SRC classification performance throughout the 1st month after SRC was optimized through the combination of cognitive testing and serum biomarkers. Considered together, these findings provide further evidence for a role of computerized cognitive testing and fluid biomarkers of neuropathology as objective measures to assist in the identification of SRC and the monitoring of clinical and neuropathological recovery."

Residents participated in one facilitated VR session, either as a group or individual session. Residents' mood and apathy were measured by the Observed Emotion Rating Scale (OERS) and the Person-Environment Apathy Rating Scale. Residents also completed a structured interview to provide their feedback after the VR session. In addition, four RACF staff members were interviewed about their experience of using the VR in residents and the ongoing feasibility. The experience of VR administered by a researcher and leisure and lifestyle coordinator as a leisure activity, significantly reduced apathy in residents (Z = -2.818, p = 0.005) through observations of increased facial expression, eye contact, physical engagement, verbal tone, and expression. The study did not find a VR impact on the OERS measures; no significant increase in fear/anxiety was observed.

            "abstract": "Dysfunctional interaction of amyloid-β (Aβ) with excess metal ions is proved to be related to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, disruption of these metal-peptide interactions using nanoparticles (NPs) holds considerable promise as a therapeutic strategy to combat this incurable disease. Given that quercetin is a natural product, the biocompatibility and small size essential for permeating the blood-brain barrier make it a potential therapeutic drug candidate for treating AD. Nanocarriers formulated with the US Food and Drug Administration-approved biocompatible and biodegradable polymer PLGA are being widely explored for the controlled delivery of therapeutic drugs, proteins, peptides, oligonucleotides, and genes. With this background, the present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of PLGA-functionalized quercetin (PLGA@QT) NPs on inhibited and disassembled Aβ42 fibrils and the PLGA@QT NPs have low cytotoxicity when tested on SH-SY5Y cells in vitro. As expected, the cytotoxicity studies of the PLGA@QT NPs led to a concentration-related behaviour on the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. And, it has demonstrated that PLGA@QT NPs can inhibit the neurotoxicity of Zn2+-Aβ42 system and enhance the viability of neuron cells. The results from behavioral tests indicate that injection of PLGA@QT NPs into APP/PS1 mice ameliorate cognition and memory impairments. Most encouragingly, the in vivo systemic toxicity of PLGA@QT NPs examined by histological analysis in major organs did not show any signs of adverse effect to mice. Thus, the prepared quercetin based nanoscale drug delivery carrier efficiently enhanced the therapeutic index and reduced the side effects. Our findings are highly encouraging, providing substantial evidence of the safety of PLGA@QT NPs for biomedical application. We expect these findings will be relevant for other NPs for treatment of AD and have broad implications in NP-based studies and applications."

This chapter is an attempt to introduce a virtual reality computer-based intervention, which can used for cognitive stimulating and disease progression evaluation of a wide range of cognitive disorders ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s disease and various dementias. Virtual reality (VR) environments have already been successfully used in cognitive rehabilitation and show increased potential for use in neuropsychological evaluation allowing for greater ecological validity while being more engaging and user friendly.

            "abstract": "Many children and adolescents around the world suffer from neurocognitive deficits due to chronic disorders, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and malaria. Resource-limited settings exacerbate the risk of negative cognitive outcomes due to high prevalence of associated disorders, poverty, and limited access to interventions. Current literature does not provide consensus regarding the efficacy of interventions to support children with cognitive impairments in low-resource settings. This research aimed to identify and evaluate interventions for youth with neurocognitive deficits in resource-limited settings. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature was conducted within five databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and WHO Index Medicus). Cognitive impairment was broadly defined to be inclusive of aspects of intellectual and cognitive functioning (e.g., working memory, attention, executive function). The income status of the country or countries in which each study was located was determined according to World Bank Income Status. Studies conducted in countries classified as low- or middle-income were included. Since low-resource areas exist within high-income countries, the resource availability within study settings in high-income countries was systematically evaluated for inclusion. The search yielded 19 articles that met all inclusion criteria. Interventions included strategies involving caregiver training, computerized and non-computerized cognitive training, physical activity, and nutritional supplementation. Interventions were administered in medical facilities, educational facilities, or the home. The majority of the interventions targeted the domains of memory and attention. Overall, the efficacy of interventions was inconsistent. Further, results indicated that the relationship between cognitive improvement and intervention types was not consistent across cognitive domains. However, when evaluating studies on an individual basis, some strategies demonstrated clinically- and statistically-significant improvement in cognitive function among specific groups of children. The low article yield highlights that few researchers have evaluated pediatric cognitive support interventions in low-resource contexts. This review suggests support strategies that should be considered for future studies as neurocognitive screening capacity improves in resource-limited settings."

We now studied whether additional nutrients can improve the efficacy of fish oil in alleviating cognitive deficits and amyloid pathology in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic and wild-type mice. We compared four isocaloric (5% fat) diets. The fish oil diet differed from the control diet only by substituted fish oil. Besides fish oil, the plant sterol diet was supplemented with phytosterols, while the Fortasyn diet contained as supplements precursors and cofactors for membrane synthesis, viz. uridine-monophosphate; DHA and EPA; choline; folate; vitamins B6, B12, C and E; phospholipids and selenium. Mice began the special diets at 5 months and were sacrificed at 14 months after behavioral testing. Transgenic mice, fed with control chow, showed poor spatial learning, hyperactivity in exploring a novel cage and reduced preference to explore novel odors. All fish-oil-containing diets increased exploration of a novel odor over a familiar one. Only the Fortasyn diet alleviated the spatial learning deficit. None of the diets influenced hyperactivity in a new environment. Fish-oil-containing diets strongly inhibited β- and γ-secretase activity, and the plant sterol diet additionally reduced amyloid-β 1-42 levels. These data indicate that beneficial effects of fish oil on cognition in Alzheimer model mice can be enhanced by adding other specific nutrients, but this effect is not necessarily mediated via reduction of amyloid accumulation."

To address this, we examined levels of various APP processing products as well as Abeta deposition in a genomic-based (R1.40) and a cDNA-based (Tg2576) transgenic mouse model of AD. In tissues, only brain generated detectable levels of the penultimate precursor to Abeta, APP C-terminal fragment-beta. In brain regions, holoAPP levels remained constant, but ratios of APP C-terminal fragments and levels of Abeta differed significantly. Surprisingly, cortex had the lowest steady-state levels of Abeta compared to other brain regions. Comparison of Abeta deposition in Tg2576 and R1.40 animals revealed that R1.40 exhibited more abundant deposition in cortex while Tg2576 exhibited extensive deposition in the hippocampus.

Executive function assessments were repeated for both groups following the training.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The study aimed to examine whether a cognitive training programme could have an effect on levels of executive function. While conclusions are limited owing to small sample size, improvement was seen in neuropsychological assessments of executive function following cognitive training. Positive effects reflected in everyday behaviours were not as promising.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study showed that, while it has not been previously an area of focus, individuals with DS can complete a computerised cognitive training programme. Furthermore, the results were promising with significant improvements found in neuropsychological assessments of executive function. These findings need further investigation with a larger sample size and would benefit from the use of a brain imaging component to strengthen the findings."

The most frequent type of PM errors in individuals with schizophrenia is no response, or failure to carry out the intended action. PM impairments in schizophrenia have been found to be related to everyday functioning. For individuals with schizophrenia, a number of assessment techniques have been developed to assess PM. These include: self-report questionnaires, computerized tasks, psychometric test batteries, and virtual reality tasks. So far, a few studies have used the compensatory approach to improve PM performance in individuals with schizophrenia and those who are at risk, and the results reported are promising. Based on findings of these studies, suggestions for the development of interventions for PM impairments in individuals with schizophrenia are provided.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      PM dysfunction is an important impairment in individuals with schizophrenia, and more rehabilitation studies to improve PM performance in these individuals are needed."

However, the influence of exercise interventions on patients with aMCI is still unclear.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the influence of exercise interventions on cognitive functions in patients with aMCI.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Four literature databases (PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library) and three Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and China Science and Technology Journal Database) were searched from their inception to August 31, 2022. Based on the preliminary search of seven databases and their cited references, a total of 2,290 records were identified. Finally, 10 studies with a total of 28 data points involving 575 participants with aMCI were included in this meta-analysis. If the measurements of outcomes were different among studies, the effect size was synthesized using the standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). If the measurements were the same, the weight mean difference (WMD) with a 95% CI was used to integrate the effect size.\n    \n\n\n          Data synthesis:\n        \n      \n      The results showed that exercise interventions had no significant effects on improving several specific domains of cognitive functions including working memory (WMD = -0.05; 95% CI = -0.74 to 0.63; p = 0.88; I 2 = 78%) and attention (SMD = 0.20; 95% CI = -0.31 to 0.72; p = 0.44; I 2 = 60%). Additionally, exercise interventions had a significant effect on global cognitive function (SMD = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.50-0.90; p < 0.00001; I 2 = 29%) and some specific cognitive domains including immediate recall (SMD = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.28-0.81; p < 0.0001; I 2 = 0%), delayed recall (SMD = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.45-0.87; p < 0.00001; I 2 = 37%), and executive function (SMD = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.16-0.60; p= 0.0006; I 2 = 4%). Furthermore, subgroup analysis based on the intervention forms indicated that multi-component interventions (SMD = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.11-0.77; p = 0.009; I 2 = 0%) appeared to be less effective than the single-component intervention (SMD = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.60-1.10; p < 0.00001; I 2 = 10%) in terms of boosting global cognitive function.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This meta-analysis suggests that the exercise can help patients with aMCI improve global cognitive function.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Chief emergency physicians are regarded as an important element in the care of the injured and sick following mass casualty accidents. Their education is very theoretical; practical content in contrast often falls short. Limitations are usually the very high costs of realistic (large-scale) exercises, poor reproducibility of the scenarios, and poor corresponding results.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To substantially improve the educational level because of the complexity of mass casualty accidents, modified training concepts are required that teach the not only the theoretical but above all the practical skills considerably more intensively than at present. Modern training concepts should make it possible for the learner to realistically simulate decision processes. This article examines how interactive virtual environments are applicable for the education of emergency personnel and how they could be designed.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Virtual simulation and training environments offer the possibility of simulating complex situations in an adequately realistic manner. The so-called virtual reality (VR) used in this context is an interface technology that enables free interaction in addition to a stereoscopic and spatial representation of virtual large-scale emergencies in a virtual environment. Variables in scenarios such as the weather, the number wounded, and the availability of resources, can be changed at any time. The trainees are able to practice the procedures in many virtual accident scenes and act them out repeatedly, thereby testing the different variants.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      With the aid of the \"InSitu\" project, it is possible to train in a virtual reality with realistically reproduced accident situations. These integrated, interactive training environments can depict very complex situations on a scale of 1:1. Because of the highly developed interactivity, the trainees can feel as if they are a direct part of the accident scene and therefore identify much more with the virtual world than is possible with desktop systems.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Interactive, identifiable, and realistic training environments based on projector systems could in future enable a repetitive exercise with changes within a decision tree, in reproducibility, and within different occupational groups. With a hard- and software environment numerous accident situations can be depicted and practiced. The main expense is the creation of the virtual accident scenes. As the appropriate city models and other three-dimensional geographical data are already available, this expenditure is very low compared with the planning costs of a large-scale exercise."

Computerized cognitive training (CCT) has strong evidence for safety and efficacy in several populations, but its effects in MS have yet to be specified. Objective. We aimed to synthesize the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of CCT on cognitive, psychosocial, and functional outcomes in adults with MS. Method. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and CENTRAL from inception to March 2019. We calculated standardized mean difference (Hedges' g) of change from baseline in untrained measures of cognition, individual domains, psychosocial functioning, and daily function between CCT and control groups using a random-effects model. Results. A total of 20 RCTs encompassing 982 participants (78% with relapsing-remitting MS) were included. The overall cognitive effect size was moderate (g = 0.30; 95% CI = 0.18-0.43), with no evidence of small-study effect or between-study heterogeneity (prediction interval = 0.17-0.44). Small to moderate effect sizes were found for attention/processing speed, executive functions, and verbal and visuospatial memory. Evidence for working memory, fatigue, and psychosocial and daily functioning were inconclusive. Cognitive effects waned without further training. Conclusions. CCT is efficacious for overall and key cognitive domains in adults with MS, but efficacy on other outcomes and in progressive subtypes remains unclear. Long-term and well-powered trials with diverse cohorts are needed to optimize and maintain the efficacy of CCT, investigate transfer to daily living, and determine who can benefit and whether CCT is a cost-effective strategy to attenuate cognitive decline in MS."

The aim of this study is to examine the viability of a brief computerized cognitive test battery, Central Nervous System Vital Signs (CNSVS), in COPD patients.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients with COPD referred to tertiary pulmonary rehabilitation were included. Cognitive functioning of patients was assessed with CNSVS before pulmonary rehabilitation and compared with age-corrected CNSVS norms. CNSVS is a 30 minute computerized test battery that includes tests of verbal and visual memory, psychomotor speed, processing speed, cognitive flexibility, complex attention, executive functioning, and reaction time.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      CNSVS was fully completed by 205 (93.2%, 105 females, 100 males) of the total group of patients (n=220, 116 females, 104 males). Z-tests showed that COPD patients performed significantly worse than the norms on all CNSVS cognitive domains. Slightly more than half of the patients (51.8%) had impaired functioning on 1 or more cognitive domains. Patients without computer experience performed significantly worse on CNSVS than patients using the computer frequently.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The completion rate of CNSVS was high and cognitive dysfunctions measured with this screening were similar to the results found in prior research, including paper and pen cognitive tests. These results support the viability of this brief computerized cognitive screening in COPD patients, that may lead to better care for these patients. Cognitive performance of patients with little computer experience should be interpreted carefully. Future research on this issue is needed."

            "abstract": "Visuoperceptual disorders have been identified in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and may affect the perception of optic flow for heading direction during navigation. Studies in healthy subjects have confirmed that heading direction can be determined by equalizing the optic flow speed (OS) between visual fields. The present study investigated the effects of PD on the use of optic flow for heading direction, walking parameters, and interlimb coordination during navigation, examining the contributions of OS and spatial frequency (dot density). Twelve individuals with PD without dementia, 18 age-matched normal control adults (NC), and 23 young control adults (YC) walked through a virtual hallway at about 0.8 m/s. The hallway was created by random dots on side walls. Three levels of OS (0.8, 1.2, and 1.8 m/s) and dot density (1, 2, and 3 dots/m(2)) were presented on one wall while on the other wall, OS and dot density were fixed at 0.8 m/s and 3 dots/m(2), respectively. Three-dimensional kinematic data were collected, and lateral drift, walking speed, stride frequency and length, and frequency, and phase relations between arms and legs were calculated. A significant linear effect was observed on lateral drift to the wall with lower OS for YC and NC, but not for PD. Compared to YC and NC, PD veered more to the left under OS and dot density conditions. The results suggest that healthy adults perceive optic flow for heading direction. Heading direction in PD may be more affected by the asymmetry of dopamine levels between the hemispheres and by motor lateralization as indexed by handedness."

However, it is not clear if there are IADL domains that are consistently affected across patients with MCI. In this systematic review, therefore, we aimed to summarize research results regarding the performance of MCI patients in specific IADL (sub)domains compared with persons who are cognitively normal and/or patients with dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The databases PsycINFO, PubMed and Web of Science were searched for relevant literature in December 2013. Publications from 1999 onward were considered for inclusion. Altogether, 497 articles were retrieved. Reference lists of selected articles were searched for potentially relevant articles. After screening the abstracts of these 497 articles, 37 articles were included in this review.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In 35 studies, IADL deficits (such as problems with medication intake, telephone use, keeping appointments, finding things at home and using everyday technology) were documented in patients with MCI. Financial capacity in patients with MCI was affected in the majority of studies. Effect sizes for group differences between patients with MCI and healthy controls were predominantly moderate to large. Performance-based instruments showed slight advantages (in terms of effect sizes) in detecting group differences in IADL functioning between patients with MCI, patients with Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      IADL requiring higher neuropsychological functioning seem to be most severely affected in patients with MCI. A reliable identification of such deficits is necessary, as patients with MCI with IADL deficits seem to have a higher risk of converting to dementia than patients with MCI without IADL deficits. The use of assessment tools specifically designed and validated for patients with MCI is therefore strongly recommended. Furthermore, the development of performance-based assessment instruments should be intensified, as they allow a valid and reliable assessment of subtle IADL deficits in MCI, even if a proxy is not available. Another important point to consider when designing new scales is the inclusion of technology-associated IADL. Novel instruments for clinical practice should be time-efficient and easy to administer."

However, the specific neurochemical alterations in cerebral regions that contribute to cognitive decline still remain unknown. In the present study, we measured cerebral morphological and neurochemical alterations using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in an AD model of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis indicated atrophy of the hippocampus, motor cortex, striatum, amygdaloid body, septal area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and accumbens nucleus in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Furthermore, the hippocampus was selected as a region of interest (ROI) to explore neurochemical metabolism. The results showed that the ratios of N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) and glutamate/creatine (Glu/Cr) were reduced, while myo-inositol/creatine (mIn/Cr) was increased in APP/PS1 transgenic mice compared to the wild type mice and accompanied by a decline in learning and memory. Taken together, the present study suggests that hippocampal atrophy and neurochemical changes in NAA, Glu and mIn may play a causative role in the cognitive decline associated with AD."

            "abstract": "This paper focuses on the method for creating 3-dimensional (3D) digital models extracted from patient- specific scans of the brain. The described approach consists of several cross-platform stages: raw data segmentation, data correction in 3D-modelling software, post-processing of the 3D digital models and their presentation on an interactive web-based platform. This method of data presentation offers a cost and time effective option to present medical data accurately. An important aspect of the process is using real patient data and enriching the traditional slice-based representation of the scans with 3D models that can provide better understanding of the organs' structures. The resulting 3D digital models also form the basis for further processing into different modalities, for example models in Virtual Reality or 3D physical model printouts. The option to make medical data less abstract and more understandable can extend their use beyond diagnosis and into a potential aid in anatomy and patient education. The methods presented in this paper were originally based on the master thesis 'Transparent Minds: Testing for Efficiency of Transparency in 3D Physical and 3D Digital Models', which focussed on creating and comparing the efficiency of transparent 3D physical and 3D digital models from real-patient data."

We aimed to investigate changes in white matter and cognitive functioning following computerized cognitive training. Methods. Sixteen adolescents with moderate-to-severe TBI (age 15.6 ± 1.8 years, 1.2-4.6 years postinjury) completed the 8-week BrainGames program and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and cognitive assessment at time point 1 (before training) and time point 2 (after training). Sixteen healthy controls (HC) (age 15.6 ± 1.8 years) completed DWI assessment at time point 1 and cognitive assessment at time point 1 and 2. Fixel-based analyses were used to examine fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and fiber cross-section (FC) on a whole brain level and in tracts of interest. Results. Patients with TBI showed cognitive impairments and extensive areas with decreased FA and increased MD together with an increase in FC in the body of the corpus callosum and left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) at time point 1. Patients improved significantly on the inhibition measure at time point 2, whereas the HC group remained unchanged. No training-induced changes were observed on the group level in diffusion metrics. Exploratory correlations were found between improvements on verbal working memory and reduced MD of the left SLF and between increased performance on an information processing speed task and increased FA of the right precentral gyrus. Conclusions. Results are indicative of positive effects of BrainGames on cognitive functioning and provide preliminary evidence for neuroplasticity associated with cognitive improvements following cognitive intervention in TBI."

Impairment rates, mean performance, and pre- and post-operative changes were compared using standardized Z-scores.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Approximately 2-3 h of traditional assessment indicated an average of 2.88 cognitive impairments per patient, while the 30-min screen indicated 1.18. As might be expected, traditional assessment using multiple items across the difficulty range proved more sensitive than brief screening measures in areas such as memory and attention. However, the capacity of the screening app to capture reaction times enhanced its sensitivity, relative to traditional assessment, in the area of non-verbal function. Where there was overlap between the two assessments, for example digit span tasks, the results were broadly equivalent.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Cognitive impairments were common in this sample and app-based screening complemented traditional neuropsychological assessment.

            "abstract": "There are currently no regulatory approved pharmacological treatments for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS). One possibility is that trial methodology itself is hindering their development. Emerging evidence suggests that patients with schizophrenia may show limited benefit from pro-cognitive interventions if they already exhibit intact cognitive performance, relative to normative thresholds. The aim of this report was to examine the extent to which objectively assessed cognitive performance has been used as an eligibility and/or stratification criterion in CIAS pharmacotherapy trials. On 16th January 2019, we conducted a systematic search of studies listed on ClinicalTrials.gov to identify randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on pharmacotherapy trials conducted in patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, in which a paper-and-pencil or computerized cognitive task (or battery) was specified as a primary outcome measure. Of the 87 trials that met our inclusion criteria, 10 (11.5%) required the presence of an objectively assessed cognitive deficit as part of their patient eligibility criteria. No studies reported stratifying patients according to the presence or degree of cognitive impairment they exhibited. These results suggest that the vast majority of CIAS trials may have been underpowered due to the inclusion of cognitively \"normal\" patients. Purposive screening for cognitive impairment could increase CIAS trial success."

            "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction is a key pathologic factor in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuronal mitochondria have been proposed to be a promising therapeutic target for AD, especially for the failures of phase III clinical trials on conventional amyloid-β (Aβ) targeted therapy. However, the efficient intravenous delivery of therapeutic agents to neuronal mitochondria in the brain remains a major challenge due to the complicated physiological environment. Recently, biomaterials-based nanomedicine has been widely investigated for the treatment of AD. Herein, we devised a strategy for functional antioxidant delivery to neuronal mitochondria by loading antioxidants into red blood cell (RBC) membrane-coated nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) bearing rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG29) and triphenylphosphine cation (TPP) molecules attached to the RBC membrane surface (RVG/TPP NPs@RBCm). With the advantage of suitable physicochemical properties of NLC and unique biological functions of the RBC membrane, RVG/TPP NPs@RBCm are stabilized and enabled sustained drug release, providing improved biocompatibility and long-term circulation. Under the synergistic effects of RVG29 and TPP, RVG/TPP NPs@RBCm can not only penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) but also target neuron cells and further localize in the mitochondria. After encapsulating Resveratrol (RSV) as the model antioxidant, the data demonstrated that RVG/TPP-RSV NPs@RBCm can relieve AD symptoms by mitigating Aβ-related mitochondrial oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo. The memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice is significantly improved following the systemic administration of RVG/TPP-RSV NPs@RBCm. In conclusion, intravenous neuronal mitochondria-targeted dual-modified novel biomimetic nanosystems are a promising therapeutic candidate for ROS-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD."

Despite the growing use of VR programs, only few studies have considered the application of everyday activities like shopping or travelling in VR training devices.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We developed a novel 360°-VR supermarket, which is displayed on a circular arrangement of 8 touch-screens--the \"OctaVis\". In this setting, healthy human adults had to memorize an auditorily presented shopping list (list A) and subsequently buy all remembered products of this list in the VR supermarket. This procedure was accomplished on three consecutive days. On day four, a new shopping list (list B) was introduced and participants had to memorize and buy only products of this list. On day five, participants had to buy all remembered items of list A again, but without new presentation of list A. Additionally, we obtained measures of participants' presence, immersion and figural-spatial memory abilities. We also tested a sample of patients with focal epilepsy with an extended version of our shopping task, which consisted of eight days of training.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We observed a comprehensive and stable effect of learning for the number of correct products, the required time for shopping, and the length of movement trajectories in the VR supermarket in the course of the training program.

We propose that cognitive training with the VR supermarket program in the OctaVis will be efficient for the assessment and training of real-life cognitive abilities in healthy subjects and patients with epilepsy. It is most likely that our findings will also apply for patients with cognitive disabilities resulting from other neurological and psychiatric syndromes."

All participants slept at home with a wearable headband device which automatically identified sleep stages and administered the sound during REM sleep. Participants' anxiety level was assessed using measures of parasympathetic (root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats, RMSSD) and sympathetic (non-specific skin conductance responses, ns-SCRs) activity, and subjective measures (Subjective Units of Distress Scale, SUDS), during the preparation phase of their talks before (T1) and after (T2) one full-night's sleep and after 1 week at home (T3).

Virtual reality enables the unique ability to perform body-swap illusions, and research has shown that these illusions can change participant behavior. Characteristically people take on the traits of the avatar they are embodying. We hypothesized that female participants embodying male avatars when a stereotype threat was made salient would demonstrate stereotype lift. We tested our hypothesis through a between-participants user study in an immersive virtual environment by measuring working memory. Our results support that stereotype threat can be induced in an immersive virtual environment, and that stereotype lift is possible with fully-immersive body-swap illusions. Additionally, our results suggest that participants in a gender-swapped avatar without an induced stereotype threat have significantly impaired working memory; however, this impairment is lifted when a threat is made salient. We discuss possible theories as to why a body-swap illusion from a female participant into a male avatar would only increase working memory impairment when not under threat, as well as applications and future research directions. Our results offer additional insight into understanding the cognitive effects of body-swap illusions, and provide evidence that virtual reality may be an applicable tool for decreasing the gender gap in technology."

In a sample of 11 frequent ketamine users and 15 poly-drug controls, matched for IQ, age, years in education. We used fMRI utilizing an ROI approach to examine the neural activity of three regions known to support successful navigation; the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and the caudate nucleus during a virtual reality task of spatial memory. Frequent ketamine users displayed spatial memory deficits, accompanied by and related to, reduced activation in both the right hippocampus and left parahippocampal gyrus during navigation from memory, and in the left caudate during memory updating, compared to controls. Ketamine users also exhibited schizotypal and dissociative symptoms that were related to hippocampal activation. Impairments in spatial memory observed in ketamine users are related to changes in medial temporal lobe activation. Disrupted medial temporal lobe function may be a consequence of chronic ketamine abuse and may relate to schizophrenia-like symptomatology observed in ketamine users."

These findings implicate impaired neuroanatomical plasticity as an important contributing factor to cognitive deficits in the APP mouse model of AD.

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVES\nDeficits in working memory (WM) are associated with age-related decline. We report findings from a clinical trial that examined the effectiveness of Cogmed, a computerized program that trains WM. We compare this program to a Sham condition in older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).\n## METHODS\nOlder adults (N = 68) living in the community were assessed. Participants reported memory impairment and met criteria for MCI, either by poor delayed memory or poor performance in other cognitive areas. The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS, Delayed Memory Index) and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) were utilized. All presented with normal Mini Mental State Exams (MMSE) and activities of daily living (ADLs). Participants were randomized to Cogmed or a Sham computer program. Twenty-five sessions were completed over five to seven weeks. Pre, post, and follow-up measures included a battery of cognitive measures (three WM tests), a subjective memory scale, and a functional measure.\n## RESULTS\nBoth intervention groups improved over time. Cogmed significantly outperformed Sham on Span Board and exceeded in subjective memory reports at follow-up as assessed by the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ). The Cogmed group demonstrated better performance on the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), a measure of adjustment and far transfer, at follow-up. Both groups, especially Cogmed, enjoyed the intervention.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nResults suggest that WM was enhanced in both groups of older adults with MCI. Cogmed was better on one core WM measure and had higher ratings of satisfaction. The Sham condition declined on adjustment.\n"

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      With the recent publication of new criteria for the diagnosis of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is a need for neuropsychological tools that take premorbid functioning into account in order to detect subtle cognitive decline. Using demographic adjustments is one method for increasing the sensitivity of commonly used measures. We sought to provide a useful online z-score calculator that yields estimates of percentile ranges and adjusts individual performance based on sex, age and/or education for each of the neuropsychological tests of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set (NACC, UDS). In addition, we aimed to provide an easily accessible method of creating norms for other clinical researchers for their own, unique data sets.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data from 3,268 clinically cognitively-normal older UDS subjects from a cohort reported by Weintraub and colleagues (2009) were included. For all neuropsychological tests, z-scores were estimated by subtracting the raw score from the predicted mean and then dividing this difference score by the root mean squared error term (RMSE) for a given linear regression model.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      For each neuropsychological test, an estimated z-score was calculated for any raw score based on five different models that adjust for the demographic predictors of SEX, AGE and EDUCATION, either concurrently, individually or without covariates. The interactive online calculator allows the entry of a raw score and provides five corresponding estimated z-scores based on predictions from each corresponding linear regression model. The calculator produces percentile ranks and graphical output.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      An interactive, regression-based, normative score online calculator was created to serve as an additional resource for UDS clinical researchers, especially in guiding interpretation of individual performances that appear to fall in borderline realms and may be of particular utility for operationalizing subtle cognitive impairment present according to the newly proposed criteria for Stage 3 preclinical Alzheimer's disease."

DG is utilized as a major starting material for the production of steroidal drugs in the pharmaceutical industry. Due to its wide range of pharmacological activities and medicinal properties, it has been used in the treatment of cancers, hyperlipidemia, inflammation, and infections. Numerous studies have reported that DG is useful in the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases. Its therapeutic mechanisms are based on the mediation of different signaling pathways, and targeting these pathways might lead to the development of effective therapeutic agents for neurological diseases. The present review mainly summarizes recent progress using DG and its derivatives as therapeutic agents for multiple neurological disorders along with their various mechanisms in the central nervous system. In particular, those related to therapeutic efficacy for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, brain injury, neuroinflammation, and ischemia are discussed. This review article also critically evaluates existing limitations associated with the solubility and bioavailability of DG and discusses imperatives for translational clinical research. It briefly recapitulates recent advances in structural modification and novel formulations to increase the therapeutic efficacy and brain levels of DG. In the present review, databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were used for studies of DG and its derivatives in the treatment of central nervous system diseases published in English until December 10, 2019. Three independent researchers examined articles for eligibility. A total of 150 articles were screened from the above scientific literature databases. Finally, a total of 46 articles were extracted and included in this review. Keywords related to glioma, ischemia, memory, aging, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer, Parkinson, and neurodegenerative disorders were searched in the databases based on DG and its derivatives."

            "abstract": "Aerobic, anaerobic, and strength exercises are known to improve various cognitive functions, such as executive functions, pattern separation, and working memory. High-intensity functional training (HIFT) is a form of physical activity that can be modified to any fitness level and elicits greater muscle recruitment than repetitive aerobic exercises, thereby improving cardiovascular endurance, strength, and flexibility. HIFT emphasizes functional, multi-joint movements via high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and muscle-strengthening exercises. It is yet unknown, however, whether HIFT affects cognitive functions in adolescents. To address this question, we subjected adolescents to 3 × 20 min training sessions/week of HIFT for 3 months. The effects of HIFT were tested on performance in: (1) virtual reality (VR)-based spatial learning task; (2) computerized visual pattern separation; and (3) attention span. The control group performed a typical physical class three times per week. The effects on cognition were tested at baseline and following 3 months of HIFT. Three months into the intervention, the HIFT group achieved higher scores in the spatial learning task, pattern separation task, and in the attention span test, compared with controls. These data suggest that HIFT can potentially translate into improving school performance in adolescents."

Methods In this experimental training study, 26 stroke patients underwent DTI and neuropsychological tests at 3 time points - before and after a passive phase of 6 weeks, and again after 6 weeks of working memory training (Cogmed QM). Fractional anisotropy (FA) was extracted from stroke-free brain areas to assess the white matter microstructure. Twenty-two participants completed the majority of training (≥18/25 sessions) and were entered into longitudinal analyses. Results Significant correlations between FA and baseline cognitive functions were observed (r = 0.58, p = 0.004), however, no evidence was found of generally improved cognitive functions following training or of changes in white matter microstructure. Conclusions While white matter microstructure related to baseline cognitive function in stroke patients, the study revealed no effect on cognitive functions or microstructural changes in white matter in relation to computerized working memory training."

Furthermore, the normal neuronal functions of APP and its various metabolites still remain under-investigated and unclear. Here, we highlight emerging areas of APP function that may provide new insights into synaptic development, cognition, and gene regulation. By modulating expression levels of endogenous APP in primary cortical neurons, the frequency and amplitude of calcium oscillations is modified, implying a key role for APP in maintaining neuronal calcium homeostasis essential for synaptic transmission. Disruption of this homeostatic mechanism predisposes to aging and AD. Synaptic spine loss is a feature of neurogeneration resulting in learning and memory deficits, and emerging evidence indicates a role for APP, probably mediated via one or more of its metabolites, in spine structure and functions. The intracellular domain of APP (AICD) has also emerged as a key epigenetic regulator of gene expression controlling a diverse range of genes, including APP itself, the amyloid-degrading enzyme neprilysin, and aquaporin-1. A fuller understanding of the physiological and pathological actions of APP and its metabolic network could provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in AD."

In this study, we performed a functional network connectivity analysis using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the association between changes in functional connectivity in the brain and the improvement in cognitive abilities after cognitive training. A computerized cognitive training program was used to improve the abilities of fifteen participants with MCI. The cognitive training program (Comcog), which consists of three weekly sessions totaling 90 min, was conducted with all participants over six weeks. The cognitive abilities before (pre-Comcog) and after (post-Comcog) the cognitive training process were measured using a neurocognitive function test. After the Comcog, the participants enhanced their visual and verbal memories, attention, and visuo-motor coordination. The functional connectivity between cingulo-opercular (CON) and default mode (DMN) showed significant improvements after Comcog training. Therefore, our study suggests that cognitive training may improve the cognitive abilities of participants. This improvement was associated with an increase in the functional connectivity between DMN and CON. The increase in functional connectivity after cognitive training was specifically associated with overall cognitive functions, including executive, memory, decision-making, and motivational functions."

Sixty elderly patients with COPD and MCI admitted to a hospital from January 2019 to February 2020 were randomly divided into a control group and study group, with 50 cases in each group. On the basis of conventional drug therapy, health education, and respiratory muscle training, patients in the control group received routine lung rehabilitation training, while patients in the study group received lung rehabilitation training using the BioMaster virtual scene interactive rehabilitation training system. Both groups continued training for 12 weeks. Lung function indexes, 6-minute walking distance, COPD assessment test (CAT) score, and Montreal Cognitive Function Assessment Scale (MoCA) score were compared between the 2 groups before training and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after training. The experimental results show that, in the study group, the percentage of FEV1 in the predicted value at 8 weeks after training, the percentage of FEV1 in the predicted value at 12 weeks after training, and FEV1/FVC were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05).

Based on hierarchical regression analyses, structural equation modelling was used to test the mediation hypothesis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Both fitness and aortic stiffness independently predicted Spatial Working Memory (SWM) performance, however no mediating relationship was found. Additionally, the derived structural equation model shows that, in conjunction with BMI and sex, fitness and aortic stiffness explain 33% of the overall variation in SWM, with age no longer directly predicting any variation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Greater fitness and lower aortic stiffness both independently predict better SWM in older people. The strong effect of age on cognitive performance is totally mediated by fitness and aortic stiffness. This suggests that addressing both physical fitness and aortic stiffness may be important to reduce the rate of age associated cognitive decline."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Very preterm children generally perform poorly in executive functions and particularly in working memory. Adaptive training tasks encouraging these children to work continuously on their personal working memory capacity can be very useful. Above all in preschool-age children, several cognitive training programs focused on improving working memory capacity. Cogmed is a computerized visuospatial cognitive training program that improves working memory in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The main objective is to assess the long-term effects (18 months) of cognitive training (Cogmed) on visuospatial processing in preschool-age very preterm children with working memory impairment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The EPIREMED study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicentric trial nested in a population based epidemiological survey.

The study will include 166 children from national study EPIPAGE-2 (Epidemiological Study on Small Gestational Ages). The intervention consists of 25 sessions administered over a 5- to 8-week period. The primary endpoint will be the visuospatial processing, assessed by the score of the visuospatial index: score of the WPPSI-IV (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence). The secondary endpoints will allow to assess the executive functions, language and abilities, infant behavior, quality of life assessment, school performance and parental anxiety.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This project's primary goal is to demonstrate the necessity of early visuospatial memory assessment within the vulnerable population of very preterm children, and to prove the feasibility and efficacy of computerized cognitive training using online software programs. A better global neuropsychological development improvement (visuospatial processing and other far transfer) can be expected with an improvement in learning and decreased behavioral problems. In the long term, these improvements might also reduce those global costs linked to the consequences of extreme prematurity.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \nNCT02757794 (registered on 2nd May 2016 at ClinicalTrial.gov)."

            "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) approaches have had considerable success in measurement of functional capacity. However, it is not clear if factors other than cognitive impairment influence performance on VR measures. Many people with schizophrenia have significant negative symptoms and they could reduce engagement in assessment. 158 patients with schizophrenia performed the VRFCAT, were tested with the MCCB, were rated with the PANSS, and were rated on everyday functioning. Scores for reduced emotional experience and reduced expression were derived. Reduced emotional experience, but not reduced expression, was correlated with socially relevant VRFCAT subtasks and real-world social functioning. Performance on the socially relevant subtasks, but not the solitary subtasks, shared variance with work outcomes. MCCB performance was associated with both subdomains, but socially relevant subtasks shared more variance. Patients with higher reduced emotional experience validly engaged in socially relevant VR simulations, as indexed by correlations with outcome measures. These patients had poorer performance on socially relevant tasks than on solitary tasks. The differential validity of solitary vs. socially relevant simulations was supported by differences in correlates, suggesting that assessments with a focus on performance of simulated socially relevant tasks could be developed."

            "abstract": "Dominantly inherited mutations in the genes encoding presenilins (PS) and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) are the major causes of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). The prevailing view of AD pathogenesis posits that accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, particularly Abeta42, is the central event triggering neurodegeneration. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that loss of essential functions of PS could better explain dementia and neurodegeneration in AD. First, conditional inactivation of PS in the adult mouse brain causes progressive memory loss and neurodegeneration resembling AD, whereas mouse models based on overproduction of Abeta have failed to produce neurodegeneration. Second, whereas pathogenic PS mutations enhance Abeta42 production, they typically reduce Abeta40 generation and impair other PS-dependent activities. Third, gamma-secretase inhibitors can enhance the production of Abeta42 while blocking other gamma-secretase activities, thus mimicking the effects of PS mutations. Finally, PS mutations have been identified in frontotemporal dementia, which lacks amyloid pathology. Based on these and other observations, we propose that partial loss of PS function may underlie memory impairment and neurodegeneration in the pathogenesis of AD. We also speculate that Abeta42 may act primarily to antagonize PS-dependent functions, possibly by operating as an active site-directed inhibitor of gamma-secretase."

            "abstract": "Hippocampal-cortical dialogue, during which hippocampal ripple oscillations support information transfer, is necessary for long-term consolidation of spatial memories. Whereas a vast amount of work has been carried out to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the impairments of memory formation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), far less work has been accomplished to understand these memory deficiencies at the network-level interaction that may underlie memory processing. We recently demonstrated that freely moving 8 to 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice, a model of AD, are able to learn a spatial reference memory task despite a major deficit in Sharp-Wave Ripples (SWRs), the integrity of which is considered to be crucial for spatial memory formation. In order to test whether reconfiguration of hippocampal-cortical dialogue could be responsible for the maintenance of this ability for memory formation, we undertook a study to identify causal relations between hippocampal and cortical circuits in epochs when SWRs are generated in hippocampus. We analyzed the data set obtained from multielectrode intracranial recording of transgenic and wild-type mice undergoing consolidation of spatial memory reported in our previous study. We applied Directed Transfer Function, a connectivity measure based on Granger causality, in order to determine effective coupling between distributed circuits which express oscillatory activity in multiple frequency bands. Our results showed that hippocampal-cortical coupling in epochs containing SWRs was expressed in the two frequency ranges corresponding to ripple (130-180 Hz) and slow gamma (20-60 Hz) band. The general features of connectivity patterns were similar in the 8 to 9-month-old APP/PS1 and wild-type animals except that the coupling in the slow gamma range was stronger and spread to more cortical sites in APP/PS1 mice than in the wild-type group. During the occurrence of SWRs, the strength of effective coupling from the cortex to hippocampus (CA1) in the ripple band undergoes sharp increase, involving cortical areas that were different in the two groups of animals. In the wild-type group, retrosplenial cortex and posterior cingulate cortex interacted with the hippocampus most strongly, whereas in the APP/PS1 group more anterior structures interacted with the hippocampus, that is, anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex. This reconfiguration of cortical-hippocampal interaction pattern may be an adaptive mechanism responsible for supporting spatial memory consolidation in AD mice model."

Previous work including ours has used BACE1 haploinsufficiency (BACE1(+/-); i.e., 50% reduction) as a therapeutic relevant model to evaluate the efficacy of partial β-secretase inhibition. However, it is unclear whether the extent of Aβ reductions in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice with BACE1(+/-) gene ablation may vary with sex or disease progression. Here, we compared the impacts of BACE1 haploinsufficiency on Aβ concentrations and APP processing in 5XFAD Alzheimer mice (1) between males and females and (2) between different stages with moderate and robust Aβ accumulation. First, male and female 5XFAD mice at 6-7 months of age showed equivalent levels of Aβ, BACE1, full-length APP and its metabolites. BACE1 haploinsufficiency significantly lowered soluble Aβ oligomers, total Aβ42 levels and plaque burden in 5XFAD mouse brains irrespective of sex. Furthermore, there was no sex difference in reductions of β-cleavage products of APP (C99 and sAPPβ) found in BACE1(+/-)·5XFAD mice relative to BACE1(+/+)·5XFAD controls. Meanwhile, APP and sAPPα levels in BACE1(+/-)·5XFAD mice were higher than those of 5XFAD controls regardless of sex. Based on these observations, we next combined male and female data to examine the effects of BACE1 haploinsufficiency in 5XFAD mice at 12-14 months of age, as compared with those in 6-7-month-old 5XFAD mice. Oligomeric Aβ and C99 levels were dramatically elevated in older 5XFAD mice. Although the β-metabolites of APP were significantly reduced by BACE1 haploinsufficiency in both age groups, high levels of these toxic amyloidogenic fragments remained in 12-14-month-old BACE1(+/-)·5XFAD mice. The present findings are consistent with our previous behavioral data showing that BACE1 haploinsufficiency rescues memory deficits in 5XFAD mice irrespective of sex but only in the younger age group."

AD is caused by an imbalance between Aβ production and clearance, resulting in increased amount of Aβ in various forms [2]. Reduction of Aβ production and increasing clearance of Aβ pathogenic forms are key targets in the development of potential therapeutic agents for AD treatment. Unfortunately, only nosotropic approaches for treatment of AD are currently effective in humans. These approaches mainly focus on the inhibition of brain acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE) to increase lifetime of cerebral acetylcholine [3]. It is important to emphasize that AChE itself promotes the formation of Aβ fibrils in vitro and Aβ plaques in the cerebral cortex of transgenic mouse models of AD [4]. This property of AChE results from interaction between Aβ and the peripheral anionic site of the enzyme (PAS) [5].

Concentration of drug producing 50% of AChE/BuChE activity inhibition (IC50) was measured using the method of Ellman et al. [6]. Toxicological experiments were performed using IP injection of the different compounds in mice. LD50, dose (in mg/kg) causing lethal effects in 50% of animals was taken as a criterion of toxicity [7]. The ability of compound to block in vitro AChE-induced Aβ1-40 aggregation was studied using a thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescent probe [8].In vivo biological assays. For in vivo blood-brain barrier permeation assay brains were removed 30 min after IP injection of LD50 dose of tested compound injection. The inhibitory potency was measured using the method of Ellman.Scopolamine and transgenic models of AD were used to evaluate the influence of compound 35 on spatial memory performance.Water solution of scopolamine was injected to mice (ip) 20 minutes before starting memory test during 14 days [9]. Mice were assigned to 7 groups, including 4 groups receiving injection (ip) of compound in different dosages, donepezil-treated mice (donepezil is conventionally used to treat Alzheimer's disease), positive and negative control groups. Double transgenic (APP/PS1) mice expressing a chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein and a mutant of human presenilin-1 [10] were assigned to 4 groups, including transgenic animals injected (ip) with compound 35 or donepezil solution, positive (transgenes injected with water) and negative (wild-type mice) controls.To evaluate spatial memory performance, mice were trained on a reward alternation task using a conventional T-maze [11]. The criterion for a mouse having learned the rewarded alternation task was 3 consecutive days of at least 5 correct responses out of the 6 free trials.For β-amyloid peptide load was evaluated quantitatively as a number and summary area of Thioflavine S fluorescent spots in cerebral cortex and hippocampal images using Image J program. Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We evaluated the acute toxicity of the most active compounds. The most potent AChE inhibitor compound 35 (IC50 (AChE) = 5 ± 0.5 nM) exhibited the lowest LD50 values (51 mg/kg) and inhibited brain AChE by more than 71 ± 1%. Compound 35 at 10 nM, exhibited a significant (35 ± 9%) inhibitory activity toward human AChE-induced Aβ aggregation.Scopolamine injection induced significant decrease in correct choice percentage in T-maze, as well as decrease in percentage of mice reaching criterion for learning the task by day 14. This memory deficit was relieved to some extent either by compound 35 (5 mg/kg) or donepezil (reference compound) treatment (0.75 mg/kg). Interestingly, higher doses of compound 35 (10 and 15 mg/kg) produced less therapeutic effect on spatial memory deficit.Group of APP/PS1 mice showed 3 times lower percentage of reaching behavioral criterion and lower percentage of correct choice in T-maze alternation task comparing to WT mice, whereas compound 35 (5 mg/kg) or Donepezil treatment effectively improved these parameters in APP/PS1 mice.Compound 35 treatment (5 mg/kg) during 14 days significantly reduced percentage of summary area and number of β-amyloid peptide (βAP) deposits visualized in sections of cerebral cortex, dentate gyrus, and hippocampal CA3 area in APP/PS1 mice. The most prominent reduction of βAP load by compound 35 treatment was found in CA3 area and cerebral cortex. Meanwhile, Donepezil treatment (1 mg/kg) during 14 days significantly reduced βAP load in cerebral cortex but not in dentate gyrus and CA3 area.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Experiments showed that the most potent AChE inhibitor compound 35 (6-methyluracil derivative) permeated the blood-brain barrier, improved working memory in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice and significantly reduced the number and area of Aβ plaques in the brain. Thus, compound 35 is a promising candidate as a bi-functional inhibitor of AChE for treatment of AD."

            "abstract": "The use of sedation for diagnostic procedures including gastrointestinal endoscopy is rapidly growing. Recovery of cognitive function after sedation is important because it would be important for most patients to resume safe, normal life soon after the procedure. Computerized tests have shown being accurate descriptors of cognitive function. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the time course of cognitive function recovery after sedation with propofol and remifentanil. A prospective observational double blind clinical study conducted in 34 young healthy adults undergoing elective outpatient colonoscopy under sedation with the combination of propofol and remifentanil using a target controlled infusion system. Cognitive function was measured using a validated battery of computerized cognitive tests (Cogstate™, Melbourne, Australia) at different predefined times: prior to starting sedation (Tbaseline), and then 10 min (T10), 40 min (T40) and 120 min (T120) after the end of colonoscopy. Tests included the assessment of psychomotor function, attention, visual memory and working memory. All colonoscopies were completed (median time: 26 min) without significant adverse events. Patients received a median total dose of propofol and remifentanil of 149 mg and 98 µg, respectively. Psychomotor function and attention declined at T10 but were back to baseline values at T40 for all patients. The magnitude of psychomotor task reduction was large (d = 0.81) however 100% of patients were recovered at T40. Memory related tasks were not affected 10 min after ending sedation. Cognitive impairment in attention and psychomotor function after propofol and remifentanil sedation was significant and large and could be easily detected by computerized cognitive tests. Even though, patients were fully recovered 40 min after ending the procedure. From a cognitive recovery point of view, larger studies should be undertaken to propose adequate criteria for discharge after sedation."

Clinical dementia does not develop suddenly, but rather is preceded by a period of cognitive decline beyond normal age-related change. People at this intermediate stage between normal cognitive function and clinical dementia are often described as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Considerable research and clinical efforts have been directed toward finding disease-modifying interventions that may prevent or delay progression from MCI to clinical dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effects of at least 12 weeks of computerised cognitive training (CCT) on maintaining or improving cognitive function and preventing dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched to 31 May 2018 in ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois) and ran additional searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO portal/ICTRP (www.apps.who.int/trialsearch) to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which cognitive training via interactive computerised technology was compared with an active or inactive control intervention. Experimental computerised cognitive training (CCT) interventions had to adhere to the following criteria: minimum intervention duration of 12 weeks; any form of interactive computerised cognitive training, including computer exercises, computer games, mobile devices, gaming console, and virtual reality. Participants were adults with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), or otherwise at high risk of cognitive decline.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included RCTs. We expressed treatment effects as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to describe the overall quality of evidence for each outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Eight RCTs with a total of 660 participants met review inclusion criteria. Duration of the included trials varied from 12 weeks to 18 months. Only one trial used an inactive control. Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in several domains. Overall, our ability to draw conclusions was hampered by very low-quality evidence. Almost all results were very imprecise; there were also problems related to risk of bias, inconsistency between trials, and indirectness of the evidence.No trial provided data on incident dementia. For comparisons of CCT with both active and inactive controls, the quality of evidence on our other primary outcome of global cognitive function immediately after the intervention period was very low. Therefore, we were unable to draw any conclusions about this outcome.Due to very low quality of evidence, we were also unable to determine whether there was any effect of CCT compared to active control on our secondary outcomes of episodic memory, working memory, executive function, depression, functional performance, and mortality. We found low-quality evidence suggesting that there is probably no effect on speed of processing (SMD 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.16 to 0.56; 2 studies; 119 participants), verbal fluency (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.76 to 0.44; 3 studies; 150 participants), or quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% CI -1.85 to 2.65; 1 study; 19 participants).When CCT was compared with inactive control, we obtained data on five secondary outcomes, including episodic memory, executive function, verbal fluency, depression, and functional performance. We found very low-quality evidence; therefore, we were unable to draw any conclusions about these outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Currently available evidence does not allow us to determine whether or not computerised cognitive training will prevent clinical dementia or improve or maintain cognitive function in those who already have evidence of cognitive impairment. Small numbers of trials, small samples, risk of bias, inconsistency between trials, and highly imprecise results mean that it is not possible to derive any implications for clinical practice, despite some observed large effect sizes from individual studies. Direct adverse events are unlikely to occur, although the time and sometimes the money involved in computerised cognitive training programmes may represent significant burdens. Further research is necessary and should concentrate on improving methodological rigour, selecting suitable outcomes measures, and assessing generalisability and persistence of any effects. Trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine the potential of this intervention to reduce the risk of dementia."

Soluble Aβ oligomers are thought to be the most neurotoxic species and are correlated with cognitive dysfunction in early AD. However, there is still no effective treatment so far. We determined that Pep63, a small peptide, had a neuroprotective effect on synaptic plasticity and memory in our previous study. Here, we developed novel and multifunctional liposomes targeting both Aβ oligomers and fibrils based on a liposome delivery system. Transferrin-Pep63-liposomes (Tf-Pep63-Lip), possessing the ability for blood-brain barrier targeting, were also incorporated with phosphatidic acid (PA) and loaded with neuroprotective Pep63. We discovered that administration of Tf-Pep63-Lip could significantly reduce the Aβ burden in the hippocampus, and improve cognitive deficits in 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice in the Morris-Water maze task and fear-conditioning test with the combined effects of PA and Pep63. Tf-Pep63-Lip could capture Aβ oligomers or fibrils and then facilitated microglial chemotaxis nearby for clearance. Simultaneously, Tf-Pep63-Lip hindered Aβ1-42 aggregation and disaggregated Aβ1-42 assembly due to multivalent PA-Aβ. Pep63 effectively inhibited the binding between EphB2 and Aβ oligomers after release from liposomes and rescued NMDA receptors trafficking, the basis of synaptic plasticity. No side effects were observed in either APP/PS1 or wild-type mice, indicating that Tf-Pep63-Lip might be safe under the dosing regimen used in our experiment. Taken together, our results suggested that Tf-Pep63-Lip may serve as a safe and efficient agent for AD combination therapy."

            "abstract": "In the present review, we discuss the rationale and the clinical implications of assessing visuospatial working memory (VSWM), awareness of memory deficits, and visuomotor control in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These three domains are related to neural activity in the posteromedial parietal cortex (PMC) whose hypoactivation seems to be a significant predictor of conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease (AD) as indicated by recent neuroimaging evidence. A systematic literature search was performed up to May 2021. Forty-eight studies were included: 42 studies provided analytical cross-sectional data and 6 studies longitudinal data on conversion rates. Overall, these studies showed that patients with MCI performed worse than healthy controls in tasks assessing VSWM, awareness of memory deficits, and visuomotor control; in some cases, MCI patients' performance was comparable to that of patients with overt dementia. Deficits in VSWM and metamemory appear to be significant predictors of conversion. No study explored the relationship between visuomotor control and conversion. Nevertheless, it has been speculated that the assessment of visuomotor abilities in subjects at high AD risk might be useful to discriminate patients who are likely to convert from those who are not. Being able to indirectly estimate PMC functioning through quick and easy neuropsychological tasks in outpatient settings may improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy, and therefore, the quality of the MCI patient's management."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The diagnosis of dementia relies on the presence of new-onset cognitive impairment affecting an individual's functioning and activities of daily living. The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) is a questionnaire instrument, completed by a suitable 'informant' who knows the patient well, designed to assess change in functional performance secondary to cognitive change; it is used as a tool for identifying those who may have dementia. In secondary care there are two specific instances where patients may be assessed for the presence of dementia. These are in the general acute hospital setting, where opportunistic screening may be undertaken, or in specialist memory services where individuals have been referred due to perceived cognitive problems. To ensure an instrument is suitable for diagnostic use in these settings, its test accuracy must be established.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine the accuracy of the informant-based questionnaire IQCODE for detection of dementia in a secondary care setting.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the following sources on the 28th of January 2013: ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), BIOSIS Previews (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science Core Collection (includes Conference Proceedings Citation Index) (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (BIREME). We also searched sources specific to diagnostic test accuracy: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven); DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects - via the Cochrane Library); HTA Database (Health Technology Assessment Database via the Cochrane Library) and ARIF (Birmingham University). We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, used searches of known relevant studies in PubMed to track related articles, and contacted research groups conducting work on IQCODE for dementia diagnosis to try to find additional studies. We developed a sensitive search strategy; search terms were designed to cover key concepts using several different approaches run in parallel and included terms relating to cognitive tests, cognitive screening and dementia. We used standardised database subject headings such as MeSH terms (in MEDLINE) and other standardised headings (controlled vocabulary) in other databases, as appropriate.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We selected those studies performed in secondary-care settings, which included (not necessarily exclusively) IQCODE to assess for the presence of dementia and where dementia diagnosis was confirmed with clinical assessment. For the 'secondary care' setting we included all studies which assessed patients in hospital (e.g. acute unscheduled admissions, referrals to specialist geriatric assessment services etc.) and those referred for specialist 'memory' assessment, typically in psychogeriatric services.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We screened all titles generated by electronic database searches, and reviewed abstracts of all potentially relevant studies. Two independent assessors checked full papers for eligibility and extracted data. We determined quality assessment (risk of bias and applicability) using the QUADAS-2 tool, and reporting quality using the STARD tool.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      From 72 papers describing IQCODE test accuracy, we included 13 papers, representing data from 2745 individuals (n = 1413 (51%) with dementia). Pooled analysis of all studies using data presented closest to a cut-off of 3.3 indicated that sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.94); specificity 0.66 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.75); the positive likelihood ratio was 2.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.6) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.14 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.22). There was a statistically significant difference in test accuracy between the general hospital setting and the specialist memory setting (P = 0.019), suggesting that IQCODE performs better in a 'general' setting. We found no significant differences in the test accuracy of the short (16-item) versus the 26-item IQCODE, or in the language of administration. There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies, including a highly varied prevalence of dementia (10.5% to 87.4%). Across the included papers there was substantial potential for bias, particularly around sampling of included participants and selection criteria, which may limit generalisability. There was also evidence of suboptimal reporting, particularly around disease severity and handling indeterminate results, which are important if considering use in clinical practice.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The IQCODE can be used to identify older adults in the general hospital setting who are at risk of dementia and require specialist assessment; it is useful specifically for ruling out those without evidence of cognitive decline. The language of administration did not affect test accuracy, which supports the cross-cultural use of the tool. These findings are qualified by the significant heterogeneity, the potential for bias and suboptimal reporting found in the included studies."

Prospective memory serves to remember to execute an intended action in the future. PM problems would be a challenge to an ABI patient's successful community reintegration. While retrospective memory (RM) has been extensively studied, treatment programs for prospective memory are rarely reported. The development of a treatment program for PM, which is considered timely, can be cost-effective and appropriate to the patient's environment. A 12-session virtual reality (VR)-based cognitive rehabilitation program was developed using everyday PM activities as training content. 37 subjects were recruited to participate in a pretest-posttest control experimental study to evaluate its treatment effectiveness. Results suggest that significantly better changes were seen in both VR-based and real-life PM outcome measures, related cognitive attributes such as frontal lobe functions and semantic fluency. VR-based training may be well accepted by ABI patients as encouraging improvement has been shown. Large-scale studies of a virtual reality-based prospective memory (VRPM) training program are indicated."

In all cases, the day-to-day intra-individual variability was substantial when compared with group-level, between-person variability.

Physical activity interventions have the potential to reduce the level of frailty in community-dwelling older adults. Exergaming combines physical exercise with cognitive stimulation in a virtual environment. It is an innovative and fun way of exercising, which may aid people with dementia to be more physically active. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a 12-week exergame training and equally long aerobic training, both compared to an active control group, on frailty in people with dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      A 3-armed randomized controlled trial compared exergame training, aerobic training, and an active control intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Participants:\n        \n      \n      115 people with dementia [mean (standard deviation [SD]) age = 79.2 (6.9) years; mean (SD) Mini-Mental State Examination score = 22.9 (3.4)].\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants were randomized and individually trained 3 times a week during 12 weeks.

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by memory impairment leading to dementia, deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and neuronal loss. The major component of plaques is the amyloid beta peptide, A beta, whereas NFTs contain hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau (tau). Familial AD (FAD) mutations either elevate A beta synthesis by favoring 'secretase' of the Alzheimer beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) or enhance the fibrillogenic properties of this peptide. Mutations in the tau gene cause a different disease denoted FTPD-17, but suggest that the aberrant forms of tau seen in AD are unlikely to be benign. These findings imply a complex pathogenic cascade in AD and important goals of transgenic modeling are to capture and stratify this pathogenic process. Several laboratories have created APP transgenic (Tg) mice that exhibit AD-like amyloid pathology and A beta burdens. These Tg lines also exhibit deficits in spatial reference and/or working memory, with immunization against A beta attenuating both AD-associated phenotypes. Tangle-like pathologies are observed in mice expressing FTPD-17 mutant forms of tau, but florid tau pathologies based upon the wild type (wt) tau isoforms present in AD have proven more elusive. Creation of animal models with robust amyloid and tau pathologies, yet free of irrelevant confounding pathologies, remains a major objective in this field."

The methodology is based on a systematic literature review of available studies found in Web of Science, PubMed, Springer, and Scopus on the research topic. The findings indicate that cevimeline has shown an improvement in experimentally induced cognitive deficits in animal models. Furthermore, it has demonstrated to positively influence tau pathology and reduce the levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide in the cerebral spinal fluid of Alzheimer's patients.

Although studies in animal models suggest that TREM2 is protective against Alzheimer's pathology, its effect on tau pathology and its potential beneficial role in people with Alzheimer's disease is still unclear. Our aim was to study associations between the dynamics of soluble TREM2, as a biomarker of TREM2 signalling, and amyloid β (Aβ) deposition, tau-related pathology, neuroimaging markers, and cognitive decline, during the progression of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We did a longitudinal analysis of data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) observational study, which includes families with a history of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Participants aged over 18 years who were enrolled in DIAN between Jan 1, 2009, and July 31, 2019, were categorised as either carriers of pathogenic variants in PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP genes (n=155) or non-carriers (n=93). We measured amounts of cleaved soluble TREM2 using a novel immunoassay in CSF samples obtained every 2 years from participants who were asymptomatic (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR]=0) and annually for those who were symptomatic (CDR>0). CSF concentrations of Aβ40, Aβ42, total tau (t-tau), and tau phosphorylated on threonine 181 (p-tau) were measured by validated immunoassays. Predefined neuroimaging measurements were total cortical uptake of Pittsburgh compound B PET (PiB-PET), cortical thickness in the precuneus ascertained by MRI, and hippocampal volume determined by MRI. Cognition was measured using a validated cognitive composite (including DIAN word list test, logical memory delayed recall, digit symbol coding test [total score], and minimental status examination). We based our statistical analysis on univariate and bivariate linear mixed effects models.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      In carriers of pathogenic variants, a high amyloid burden at baseline, represented by low CSF Aβ42 (β=-4·28 × 10-2 [SE 0·013], p=0·0012), but not high cortical uptake in PiB-PET (β=-5·51 × 10-3 [0·011], p=0·63), was the only predictor of an augmented annual rate of subsequent increase in soluble TREM2. Augmented annual rates of increase in soluble TREM2 were associated with a diminished rate of decrease in amyloid deposition, as measured by Aβ42 in CSF (r=0·56 [0·22], p=0·011), in presymptomatic carriers of pathogenic variants, and with diminished annual rate of increase in PiB-PET (r=-0·67 [0·25], p=0·0060) in symptomatic carriers of pathogenic variants. Presymptomatic carriers of pathogenic variants with annual rates of increase in soluble TREM2 lower than the median showed a correlation between enhanced annual rates of increase in p-tau in CSF and augmented annual rates of increase in PiB-PET signal (r=0·45 [0·21], p=0·035), that was not observed in those with rates of increase in soluble TREM2 higher than the median. Furthermore, presymptomatic carriers of pathogenic variants with rates of increase in soluble TREM2 above or below the median had opposite associations between Aβ42 in CSF and PiB-PET uptake when assessed longitudinally. Augmented annual rates of increase in soluble TREM2 in presymptomatic carriers of pathogenic variants correlated with decreased cortical shrinkage in the precuneus (r=0·46 [0·22]), p=0·040) and diminished cognitive decline (r=0·67 [0·22], p=0·0020).\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Our findings in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease position the TREM2 response within the amyloid cascade immediately after the first pathological changes in Aβ aggregation and further support the role of TREM2 on Aβ plaque deposition and compaction. Furthermore, these findings underpin a beneficial effect of TREM2 on Aβ deposition, Aβ-dependent tau pathology, cortical shrinkage, and cognitive decline. Soluble TREM2 could, therefore, be a key marker for clinical trial design and interpretation.

            "abstract": "The process of aging commonly features a gradual deterioration in cognitive performance and, in particular, the decline of memory. Despite the increased longevity of the world's population, the prevalence of neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia, continues to be a major burden on public health, and consequently, the latest research has been focused on memory and aging. Currently, the failure of episodic and Prospective memory (PM) is one of the main complaints in the elderly, considered among the early symptoms of dementia. It is therefore increasingly important to define more clearly the boundaries between normal and pathological aging. Recently, researchers have begun to build and apply Virtual Environments (VE) to the explicit purpose of better understanding the performance of episodic and PM in complex and realistic contexts, with the perspective of further developing effective training procedures that depend on reliable cognitive assessment methods. Virtual technology offers higher levels of realism than \"pen and paper\" testing and at the same time more experimental control than naturalistic settings. In this mini-review article, we examine the outcomes of recently available studies on virtual reality technology applications developed for the assessment and improvement of episodic and/or PM. To consider the latest technology, we selected 29 articles that have been published in the last 10 years. These documents show that VR-based technologies can provide a valid basis for screening and treatment and, through increased sensory stimulation and enriched environments reproducing the scenarios of everyday life, could represent effective stimulating experiences even in pathological aging."

            "abstract": "In people with psychiatric disorders, particularly those suffering from schizophrenia and related illnesses, pronounced difficulties in social interactions are a key manifestation. These difficulties can be partly explained by impairments in social cognition, defined as the ability to understand oneself and others in the social world, which includes abilities such as emotion recognition, theory of mind (ToM), attributional style, and social perception and knowledge. The impact of several kinds of interventions on social cognition has been studied recently. The best outcomes in the area of social cognition in schizophrenia are those obtained by way of cognitive remediation programs. New strategies and programs in this line are currently being developed, such as RC2S (cognitive remediation of social cognition) in Lyon, France. Considering that the social cognitive deficits experienced by patients with schizophrenia are very diverse, and that the main objective of social cognitive remediation programs is to improve patients' functioning in their daily social life, RC2S was developed as an individualized and flexible program that allows patients to practice social interaction in a realistic environment through the use of virtual reality techniques. In the RC2S program, the patient's goal is to assist a character named Tom in various social situations. The underlying idea for the patient is to acquire cognitive strategies for analyzing social context and emotional information in order to understand other characters' mental states and to help Tom manage his social interactions. In this paper, we begin by presenting some data regarding the social cognitive impairments found in schizophrenia and related disorders, and we describe how these deficits are targeted by social cognitive remediation. Then we present the RC2S program and discuss the advantages of computer-based simulation to improve social cognition and social functioning in people with psychiatric disorders."

Participants (aged 55-80 years) with type 2 diabetes, high glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) concentrations (>7·5%; >58 mmol/mol), and a high risk of cardiovascular events were randomly assigned to receive intensive glycaemic control targeting HbA(1c) to less than 6·0% (42 mmol/mol) or a standard strategy targeting HbA(1c) to 7·0-7·9% (53-63 mmol/mol). Randomisation was via a centralised web-based system and treatment allocation was not masked from clinic staff or participants. We assessed our cognitive primary outcome, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) score, at baseline and at 20 and 40 months. We assessed total brain volume (TBV), our primary brain structure outcome, with MRI at baseline and 40 months in a subset of participants. We included all participants with follow-up data in our primary analyses. In February, 2008, raised mortality risk led to the end of the intensive treatment and transition of those participants to standard treatment. We tested our cognitive function hypotheses with a mixed-effects model that incorporated information from both the 20 and 40 month outcome measures. We tested our MRI hypotheses with an ANCOVA model that included intracranial volume and factors used to stratify randomisation.

Of the 614 patients with a baseline MRI, we included 230 assigned to receive intensive treatment and 273 assigned to receive standard treatment in our primary MRI analysis at 40 months. There was no significant treatment difference in mean 40-month DSST score (difference in mean 0·32, 95% CI -0·28 to 0·91; p=0·2997). The intensive-treatment group had a greater mean TBV than the standard-treatment group (4·62, 2·0 to 7·3; p=0·0007).\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Although significant differences in TBV favoured the intensive treatment, cognitive outcomes were not different.

This technology has the potential to provide mental stimulation, a connection to autobiographical memory through reminiscence, and enhanced quality of life (QoL) to people living with dementia (PLWD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this mini-review, we examine the available evidence from studies reporting on the potential benefits of virtual and augmented reality to provide enjoyable, leisurely activities that may promote QoL and psychological well-being and facilitate social interaction. In total, 10 studies of varying study designs and durations (5 min to 6 months) using virtual (n = 9) and augmented reality (n = 1) were examined in PLWD (n = 6) and MCI (n= 3), in addition to 1 study that included participants with both conditions. Overall, the virtual experiences were enjoyed by the participants, improved their mood and apathy, and were preferred when compared with nonvirtual experiences. However, small sample sizes and variations in study design limit the generalizability of the results. Nevertheless, the use of virtual and augmented reality technology for PLWD and MCI is a novel and emerging method which may provide cognitive stimulation and improve well-being. Future research should explore the potential application of this technology to promote social interaction in both the community and aged care settings. We suggest future studies in PLWD and MCI assess the effects of more sustained use of virtual and augmented reality technology on psychological outcomes including QoL, apathy, and depressive symptoms, with the incorporation of physiological biomarker outcomes."

Concurrently, the landscape of digital cognitive assessment is rapidly evolving as technology advances, older adult tech-adoption increases, and external events (i.e., COVID-19) necessitate remote digital assessment. Here, we provide a snapshot review of the current state of digital cognitive assessment for preclinical AD including different device platforms/assessment approaches, levels of validation, and implementation challenges. We focus on articles, grants, and recent conference proceedings specifically querying the relationship between digital cognitive assessments and established biomarkers for preclinical AD (e.g., amyloid beta and tau) in clinically normal (CN) individuals. Several digital assessments were identified across platforms (e.g., digital pens, smartphones). Digital assessments varied by intended setting (e.g., remote vs. in-clinic), level of supervision (e.g., self vs. supervised), and device origin (personal vs. study-provided). At least 11 publications characterize digital cognitive assessment against AD biomarkers among CN. First available data demonstrate promising validity of this approach against both conventional assessment methods (moderate to large effect sizes) and relevant biomarkers (predominantly weak to moderate effect sizes). We discuss levels of validation and issues relating to usability, data quality, data protection, and attrition. While still in its infancy, digital cognitive assessment, especially when administered remotely, will undoubtedly play a major future role in screening for and tracking preclinical AD."

The NCAD yields seven subtest scores in addition to an overall predictive score that is calculated based on subtest results. Thirty-nine HIV-infected participants were included in this study; the majority of which (71.8 %) had undetectable plasma HIV RNA levels and a history of significant immunocompromise (median nadir CD4+ count 34 cells/μl). The mean composite neuropsychological score (NPT-8) was 46.07, and mean global deficit score (GDS) was 0.59. NCAD total subtest accuracy correlated significantly with NPT-8 (Pearson correlation r = 0.59, p < 0.0001) as well as GDS (Spearman's rho = -0.36, p = 0.02). NCAD predictive score also correlated significantly with NPT-8 (Spearman's rho = -0.5601, p = 0.0016) and GDS (Spearman's rho = 0.45, p = 0.0144). When using the most recent nosology of HAND criteria for neurocognitive impairment, the area under the curve (AUC) for NCAD total subtest accuracy was 0.7562 (p = 0.012), while the AUC for the HIV dementia scale was 0.508 (p = 0.930).

            "abstract": "This paper reviews the value and utility of measuring cognitive function in the development of new medicines by reference to the most widely used automated system in clinical research. Evidence is presented from phase 1 to 3 of the nature and quality of the information that can be obtained by applying the Cognitive Drug Research computerized assessment system to ongoing clinical trials. Valuable evidence can be obtained even in the first trial in which a novel compound is administered to man. One application of such testing is to ensure that novel compounds are relatively free from cognition-impairing properties, particularly in relation to competitor products. Another is to ensure that unwanted interactions with alcohol and other medications do not occur, or, if they do, to put them in context. In many patient populations, cognitive dysfunction occurs as a result of the disease process, and newer medicines which can treat the symptoms of the disease without further impairing function can often reveal benefits as the disease-induced cognitive dysfunction is reduced. Another major application is to identify benefits for compounds designed to enhance cognitive function. Such effects can be sought in typical phase 1 trials, or a scopolamine model of the core deficits of Alzheimer's disease can be used to screen potential antidernentia drugs. Ultimately, of course, such effects can be demonstrated using properly validated and highly sensitive automated procedures in the target populations. The data presented demonstrate that the concept of independently assessing a variety of cognitive functions is crucial in helping differentiate drugs, types of dementia, and different illnesses. Such information offers a unique insight into how the alterations to various cognitive functions will manifest themselves in everyday behavior. This reveals a major limitation of scales that yield a single score, because such limited information does not permit anything but a quantitative interpretation; and the concept of \"more\" cognitive function or \"less\" is manifestly inappropriate for something as complex and diverse as the interplay between cognitive function and human behavior. Finally, the next generations of cognitive testing are described. Testing via the telephone has just been introduced and will have dramatic effects on the logistics of conducting cognitive testing in large patient trials. Testing via the Internet is not far off either, and will come fully into play as the proportion of homes connected to the Internet increases in Europe and North America. There are no sound reasons for not wishing to include cognitive function testing in the development protocol of any novel medicine."

The memory deficits that are present in the early stages of AD are linked to the dysfunction of structures in the entorhinal cortex and limbic system, especially the hippocampus and amygdala.

One such area of recent advancement in the field of neuropsychology is technology-based assessment. There are several types of technology-based assessments available based on the type of usage, site of the assessment, type of administration, type of device used for assessment, etc. Virtual reality-based assessments and digital assessments of neurocognitions for early identification of subtle cognitive deficits in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and major neurocognitive disorders (MND) represent two newly developed technologies. A few studies have demonstrated their efficacy; however, there remain several limitations and drawbacks to their usage within the elderly population. In this review, we have briefly discussed technology-based neuropsychological assessment, along with their usage and limitations."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Can home-based computerized cognitive training programs be a useful tool to sustain cognition and quality of life in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD)? To date, the progressive nature of the disease has made this question difficult to answer. Computerized platforms provide more accessibility to cognitive trainings; however, the feasibility of long-term, home-based computerized programs for patients with AD dementia remains unclear.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      We aimed to investigate the feasibility of a 24-week home-based intervention program using the Constant Therapy app and its preliminary efficacy on cognition in patients with AD. Constant Therapy is a program developed for patients with speech and cognitive deficits. We hypothesized that patients with AD would use Constant Therapy daily over the course of the 24-week period.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data were collected over a 48-week period. We recruited participants aged between 50 and 90 years with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia. Participants were randomly assigned to either the Constant Therapy (n=10) or active control (n=9) group. The Constant Therapy group completed a tablet-based training during the first 24 weeks; the second 24 weeks of computerized training were optional. The active control group completed paper-and-pencil games during the first 24 weeks and were invited to complete an optional Constant Therapy training during the second 24 weeks. Every 6 weeks, the participants completed the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). The participants independently accessed Constant Therapy using an Apple iPad. Our primary feasibility outcomes were the rate of adherence and daily use of Constant Therapy over 24 weeks. Our secondary outcomes were Constant Therapy performance over 24 weeks and change in RBANS scores between the 2 experimental groups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Feasibility analyses were computed for participants who completed 24 weeks of Constant Therapy. We found that long-term use of the Constant Therapy program was feasible in patients with AD over 24 weeks (adherence 80%; program use 121/168 days, for 32 minutes daily). These participants showed an overall improvement in accuracy and latency (P=.005) in the Constant Therapy scores, as well as specific improvements in visual and auditory memory, attention, and arithmetic tasks. The Constant Therapy group showed improvement in the RBANS coding subtest. No unexpected problems or adverse events were observed.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Long-term (eg, 24 weeks) computerized cognitive training using Constant Therapy is feasible in patients with AD in the mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia stages. Patients adhered more to Constant Therapy than to the paper-and-pencil training over 24 weeks and improved their performance over time. These findings support the development of future randomized controlled trials that will investigate the efficacy of Constant Therapy to sustain cognitive function in patients with AD.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02521558; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02521558."

            "abstract": "Spatial navigation is a complex process requiring integration of visuoperceptual information. The present study examined how visuospatial function relates to navigational veering in Parkinson's disease, a movement disorder in which visuospatial cognition is affected by the degeneration of the basal ganglia and resulting dysfunction of the parietal lobes. We hypothesized that patients whose initial motor symptoms start on the left versus right side of the body (LPD, predominant right-hemisphere dysfunction; RPD, predominant left-hemisphere dysfunction) would display distinct patterns of navigational veering associated with the groups' dissimilar visuospatial profiles. Of particular interest was to examine the association of navigational veering (lateral deviation along the medio-lateral axis) with perception of egocentric coordinates and of radial optic flow patterns, both of which are mediated by the parietal lobes. Thirty-one non-demented Parkinson's disease patients (16 LPD, 15 RPD) and 18 healthy control (HC) adults received visuospatial tests, of whom 23 Parkinson's disease patients and 17 HC also underwent veering assessment. The participants were examined on three visual-feedback navigation conditions: none (eyes closed), natural, and optic flow supplied by a virtual-reality headset. All groups veered to the left when walking with eyes closed, women with Parkinson's disease more so than the other participants. On the navigation assessments with visual feedback, only LPD patients deviated right of centre. On tests of visuospatial function, the perceived midline was shifted rightward in LPD (men and women), increasingly so with the addition of visual input. In contrast, men with RPD showed leftward deviation. RPD patients and HC perceived optic flow in the left hemifield as faster than in the right hemifield, with a trend for the opposite pattern for LPD. Navigational veering in LPD was associated with deviation of the perceived egocentric midline and not with perception of optic flow speed asymmetries, and in RPD it was also associated with visual dependence, though in fact LPD subjects were more visually dependent than those with RPD. Our results indicate that (i) parietal-mediated perception of visual space is affected in Parkinson's disease, with both side of motor symptom onset and gender affecting spatial performance, and (ii) visual input affects veering."

Subjectively-reported sleep quality, nap frequency, sleep duration, sleep disturbance, and daytime dysfunction were significant predictors of psychosis-risk symptom frequency and severity (all p's < 0.029). Sleep disturbance ratings were the strongest predictors of psychosis-risk symptoms. Regarding cognition, individuals with PWS showed the most prominent deficits in accuracy on measures of social cognition involving faces, namely Face Memory, Age Differentiation and Emotion Recognition, and greatest slowing on measures of Attention and Emotion Recognition. However, there were no significant differences in psychosis-risk symptoms or cognitive performance as a function of PWS genetic subtype.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      PWS is associated with a high prevalence of distressing psychosis-risk symptoms, which are associated with sleep disturbance.

However, these nanomaterials have limitations. How GO is beneficial to eliminate Aβ burden, and its physiological function in Aβ-related diseases, still needs to be investigated. Moreover, postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is an Aβ-related common central nervous system complication, however, nanomedicine treatment is lacking. Methods: To evaluate the effects of GO on Aβ levels, HEK293T-APP-GFP and SHSY5Y-APP-GFP cells are established. Intramedullary fixation surgery for tibial fractures under inhalation anesthesia is used to induce dysfunction of fear memory in mice. The fear memory of mice is assessed by fear conditioning test. Results: GO treatment maximally alleviated Aβ levels by simultaneously reducing Aβ generation and enhancing its degradation through inhibiting β-cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and improving endosomal Aβ delivery to lysosomes, respectively. In postoperative mice, the hippocampal Aβ levels were significantly increased and hippocampal-dependent fear memory was impaired. However, GO administration significantly reduced hippocampal Aβ levels and improved the cognitive function of the postoperative mice. Conclusion: GO improves fear memory of postoperative mice by maximally alleviating Aβ accumulation, providing new evidence for the application of GO-based nanomedicines in Aβ-related diseases."

Each task replicates activities of daily living performed in a familiar environment. The main goal of the present study was to ascertain whether Smart Aging could differentiate between different types and levels of cognitive impairment in patients with neurodegenerative disease. Methods: Ninety-one subjects (mean age = 70.29 ± 7.70 years)-healthy older adults (HCs, n = 23), patients with single-domain amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n = 23), patients with single-domain executive Parkinson's disease MCI (PD-MCI, n = 20), and patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (mild AD, n = 25)-were enrolled in the study. All participants underwent cognitive evaluations performed using both traditional neuropsychological assessment tools, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Overall Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Smart Aging platform. We analyzed global scores on Smart Aging indices (i.e., accuracy, time, distance) as well as the Smart Aging total score, looking for differences between the four groups. Results: The findings revealed significant between-group differences in all the Smart Aging indices: accuracy (p < 0.001), time (p < 0.001), distance (p < 0.001), and total Smart Aging score (p < 0.001). The HCs outperformed the mild AD, aMCI, and PD-MCI patients in terms of accuracy, time, distance, and Smart Aging total score. In addition, the mild AD group was outperformed both by the HCs and by the aMCI and PD-MCI patients on accuracy and distance. No significant differences were found between aMCI and PD-MCI patients. Finally, the Smart Aging scores significantly correlated with the results of the neuropsychological assessments used. Conclusion: These findings, although preliminary due to the small sample size, suggest the validity of Smart Aging as a screening tool for the detection of cognitive impairment in patients with neurodegenerative diseases."

As such both Aβ and tau have long been proposed as therapeutic targets. Immunotherapy, particularly targeting Aβ, is currently the most advanced clinical strategy for treating AD. However, several Aβ-directed clinical trials have failed, and there is concern that targeting this protein may not be useful. In contrast, there is a growing optimism that tau immunotherapy may prove more efficacious. Here, for the first time, we studied the effects of chronic administration of an anti-tau monoclonal antibody (5E2) in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. For our animal model, we chose the J20 mouse line because prior studies had shown that the cognitive deficits in these mice require expression of tau. Despite the fact that 5E2 was present and active in the brains of immunized mice and that this antibody appeared to engage with extracellular tau, 5E2-treatment did not recover age-dependent spatial reference memory deficits. These results indicate that the memory impairment evident in J20 mice is unlikely to be mediated by a form of extracellular tau recognized by 5E2. In addition to the lack of positive effect of anti-tau immunotherapy, we also documented a significant increase in mortality among J20 mice that received 5E2. Because both the J20 mice used here and tau transgenic mice used in prior tau immunotherapy trials are imperfect models of AD our results recommend extensive preclinical testing of anti-tau antibody-based therapies using multiple mouse models and a variety of different anti-tau antibodies."

In the past few decades, socially assistive technologies continue to be developed amidst a rapidly evolving technological landscape to support the social health of PLWD and their caregivers. Examples include social robots, virtual reality, smart home technology, and various digital technologies, such as mobile applications for tablets and smartphones. Despite an increasing body of research and interest in this field, several gaps relating to the design and implementation process of socially assistive technologies continue to undermine their relevance for PLWD in daily life. In this paper, some of these gaps are highlighted and the role of occupational therapy in the design and implementation of socially assistive technology is presented. In the design process, occupational therapists are uniquely skilled to advise and advocate for the tailoring and personalisation of technology to address the occupational needs of PLWD. In the implementation of socially assistive technologies, occupational therapists are skilled to educate, train, and conduct ongoing evaluations with PLWD and their caregivers, to incorporate socially assistive technologies into their routine and daily lives. We recommend that occupational therapists should continue to be acquainted with such technologies through continuous professional development and educational curricula. Moreover, we highlight the necessary collaboration between occupational therapists, technology developers, and researchers to enhance the process of designing and implementing socially assistive technology, so that their relevance for PLWD and their caregivers can be maximised.Implications for rehabilitationDevelopers and designers of socially assistive technology should consider the disease trajectory of different types of dementia, as well as the different needs, abilities, preferences, occupations and routines of people living with dementia (PLWD) and/or their caregivers.Collaborations between technology developers, researchers, and occupational therapists should take place iteratively throughout the process of designing and implementing socially assistive technology to maximise their relevance and applicability for people living with dementia and their caregivers.To continue enhancing the current role of occupational therapy in socially assistive technology provision, occupational therapists should keep up to date with socially assistive technology that are being developed to support the social health of PLWD."

Despite multiple efforts to apply computational brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) analysis in predicting cognitive worsening, with several successes, brain MRI is not routinely quantified in clinical settings to guide prognosis and clinical decision-making. To encourage the clinical use of a cutting-edge image segmentation method, we developed a prediction model as part of an established web-based cloud platform, MRICloud. The model was built in a training dataset from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) where baseline MRI scans were combined with clinical data over time. Each MRI was parcellated into 265 anatomical units based on the MRICloud fully automated image segmentation function, to measure the volume of each parcel. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used as a measure of cognitive function. The normalized volume of 265 parcels, combined with baseline MMSE score, age, and sex were input variables for a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis, with MMSE change in the subsequent two years as the target for prediction. A leave-one-out analysis performed on the training dataset estimated a correlation coefficient of 0.64 between true and predicted MMSE change. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis estimated a sensitivity of 0.88 and a specificity of 0.76 in predicting substantial cognitive worsening after two years, defined as MMSE decline of ≥4 points. This MRICloud prediction model was then applied to a test dataset of clinically acquired MRIs from the Johns Hopkins Memory and Alzheimer's Treatment Center (MATC), a clinical care setting. In the latter setting, the model had both sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 in predicting substantial cognitive worsening. While the MRICloud prediction model demonstrated promise as a platform on which computational MRI findings can easily be extended to clinical use, further study with a larger number of patients is needed for validation."

            "abstract": "In the last decade, multiple lines of transgenic APP overexpressing mice have been created that recapitulate certain aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, none of the previously reported transgenic APP overexpressing rat models developed AD-like beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits, or age-related learning and memory deficits. In the present study, we have characterized a transgenic rat model overexpressing transgenes with three, familial AD mutations (two in APP and one in PS1) that were developed by Flood et al. [Flood, D.G., et al., Abeta deposition in a transgenic rat model of Alzheimer's disease. Society for Neuroscience 2003, Washington, DC, 2003]. From the age of 9 months, these rats develop Abeta deposits in both diffuse and compact forms, with the latter being closely associated with activated microglia and reactive astrocytes. Impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) was revealed by electrophysiological recordings performed on hippocampal slices from rats at 7 months of age, which is 2 months before the appearance of amyloid plaques. The deficit in LTP was accompanied by impaired spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze, which became more pronounced in transgenic rats of 13 months of age. For Tg rats of both ages, there was a trend for cognitive impairment to correlate with total Abeta42 levels in the hippocampus. The rat model therefore recapitulates AD-like amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment. The advantage of the rat model over the available mouse models is that rats provide better opportunities for advanced studies, such as serial CSF sampling, electrophysiology, neuroimaging, cell-based transplant manipulations, and complex behavioral testing."

We searched eight electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Wanfang, Web of Science, MEDLINE, CNKI, EBSCO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) for appropriate RCTs published up to August 2019. For those studies included, the data were extracted, methodological quality was evaluated, and then meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager software (version 5.3). A total of 11 of the studies were available for systematic review, which together included 1061 participants, met the inclusion criteria, and ten of these were included in the meta-analysis. For most RCTs, the methodological quality was moderate. The meta-analysis revealed that Tai Chi could significantly improve global cognitive function; memory and learning; mental speed and attention; ideas, abstraction, figural creations, and mental flexibility; and visuospatial perception. The present review adds to the evidence showing that Tai Chi is potentially beneficial in improving cognitive functions among elderly people with MCI.

Recent studies showed that people with AD might actually benefit from physical exercises and rehabilitation processes. Studies show that rehabilitation would also add value in making the day for an individual with AD a little less foggy, frustrating, isolated, and stressful for as long as possible.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The focus of our work was to explore the use of modern mobile technology to enable people with AD to improve their abilities to perform activities of daily living, and hence to promote independence and participation in social activities.

We investigated whether Rh2 can help prevent Alzheimer's disease symptoms and examined underlying mechanisms. We injected Rh2 into tg2576 Alzheimer's disease model mice and looked for behavioral improvement and senile plaque reduction in brain slices. We measured amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism species changes, amyloid beta40 and 42 levels and β, γ secretase activity in primary hippocampal neurons. By living cell staining, we detected surface and endocytosed APP. We also measured cholesterol and lipid rafts in primary neurons. Rh2 treatment significantly improved learning and memory performance at 14 months of age; it also reduced brain senile plaques at this age. Based on in vitro experiments, we found that Rh2 treatment increased soluble APPα (sAPPα) levels, increased CTFα/β ratios, and reduced amyloid beta 40 and 42 concentrations. Surface APP levels dramatically increased. Based on living cell staining, we found that Rh2 inhibited APP endocytosis. Based on lipid removal and reload experiments, we found that Rh2 can modulate APP by reducing cholesterol and lipid raft levels. We concluded that Rh2 improves learning and memory function in Alzheimer's disease model mice, and that this improvement is accomplished by reducing amyloid beta secretion and APP endocytosis, which in turn is achieved by reducing cholesterol and lipid raft concentrations."

            "abstract": "A causal contribution of hyperhomocysteinemia to cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as potential prevention or mitigation of the pathology by dietary intervention, have frequently been subjects of controversy. In the present in vivo study, we attempted to further elucidate the impact of elevated homocysteine (HCys) and homocysteic acid (HCA) levels, induced by dietary B-vitamin deficiency, and micronutrient supplementation on AD-like pathology, which was simulated using the amyloid-based AppNL-G-F knock-in mouse model. For this purpose, cognitive assessment was complemented by analyses of ex vivo parameters in whole blood, serum, CSF, and brain tissues from the mice. Furthermore, neurotoxicity of HCys and HCA was assessed in a separate in vitro assay. In confirmation of our previous study, older AppNL-G-F mice also exhibited subtle phenotypic impairment and extensive cerebral amyloidosis, whereas dietary manipulations did not result in significant effects. As revealed by proximity extension assay-based proteome analysis, the AppNL-G-F genotype led to an upregulation of AD-characteristic neuronal markers. Hyperhomocysteinemia, in contrast, indicated mainly vascular effects. Overall, since there was an absence of a distinct phenotype despite both a significant amyloid-β burden and serum HCys elevation, the results in this study did not corroborate the pathological role of amyloid-β according to the \"amyloid hypothesis,\" nor of hyperhomocysteinemia on cognitive performance. Nevertheless, this study aided in further characterizing the AppNL-G-F model and in elucidating the role of HCys in diverse biological processes. The idea of AD prevention with the investigated micronutrients, however, was not supported, at least in this mouse model of the disease."

We aimed to investigate the efficacy of CCT on cognitive, psychosocial and daily function, and assess potential effect moderators in people with PD without dementia. Randomized controlled trials of CCT were included in multivariate meta-analyses and meta-regressions. Seventeen studies (16 trials) encompassing 679 participants were included. The pooled effect of CCT relative to control was small and statistically significant for overall cognitive function (g=0.16; 95% CI 0.02-0.29). There was robust evidence for benefit on clinical measures of global cognition across 10 trials (g=0.33; 95% CI 0.19-0.48), especially in PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), as well as on individual cognitive domains. Greater CCT dose and PD-MCI population were associated with larger effect sizes, but no statistically significant differences were found between subgroups. There was no significant difference in the efficacy of home-based compared to supervised training. Our findings suggest that CCT is associated with cognitive benefits in PD, including when delivered remotely. Larger, well-powered trials are warranted to examine what specific CCT regimens are most likely to promote cognitive and everyday functioning in the long-term."

Primary care physicians (PCPs) provide the majority of medical treatment for older people and in order to effectively care for their patients with suspected cognitive impairment, they must have tools that will allow them to accurately assess their patient's cognitive function. This knowledge will assist the PCPs in formulating a diagnosis of dementia or cognitive impairment and provide an indication of risk of progression to dementia. It will also assist with monitoring response to treatment and care decisions, including medication management, capacity judgments, and the need for family involvement. Tests currently used in primary care, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination, do not accurately assess patients with mild cognitive impairments, and other tests more suitable for this purpose require further validation and may be too time-consuming in the primary care setting. A possible solution is the use of patient-administered computerized cognitive testing in the PCP's office. This systematic review identified eleven test batteries and three were judged potentially appropriate for cognitive assessment in the PCP's office. These three varied in their presentation format and the quality of cross-sectional validation studies, and none had longitudinal data for dementia prediction. Thus the existing test batteries show potential for use in primary care but further study is needed to demonstrate their feasibility and effectiveness in this setting."

Extensive evidence demonstrates that the entorhinal cortex is critically implicated in navigation underpinned by the firing of spatially modulated neurons. This study tested the hypothesis that entorhinal-based navigation is impaired in pre-dementia Alzheimer's disease. Forty-five patients with mild cognitive impairment (26 with CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarker data: 12 biomarker-positive and 14 biomarker-negative) and 41 healthy control participants undertook an immersive virtual reality path integration test, as a measure of entorhinal-based navigation. Behavioural performance was correlated with MRI measures of entorhinal cortex volume, and the classification accuracy of the path integration task was compared with a battery of cognitive tests considered sensitive and specific for early Alzheimer's disease. Biomarker-positive patients exhibited larger errors in the navigation task than biomarker-negative patients, whose performance did not significantly differ from controls participants. Path-integration performance correlated with Alzheimer's disease molecular pathology, with levels of CSF amyloid-β and total tau contributing independently to distance error. Path integration errors were negatively correlated with the volumes of the total entorhinal cortex and of its posteromedial subdivision. The path integration task demonstrated higher diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for differentiating biomarker positive versus negative patients (area under the curve = 0.90) than was achieved by the best of the cognitive tests (area under the curve = 0.57). This study demonstrates that an entorhinal cortex-based virtual reality navigation task can differentiate patients with mild cognitive impairment at low and high risk of developing dementia, with classification accuracy superior to reference cognitive tests considered to be highly sensitive to early Alzheimer's disease. This study provides evidence that navigation tasks may aid early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and the basis of this in animal cellular and behavioural studies provides the opportunity to answer the unmet need for translatable outcome measures for comparing treatment effect across preclinical and clinical trial phases of future anti-Alzheimer's drugs."

A study with a mixed methods design was conducted with nine older adults diagnosed with dementia. Interventions consisted of four sessions, in which the participants' engagement, psychological and behavioral symptoms, and simulation sickness symptoms were evaluated. Neuropsychiatric symptomatology and quality of life were measured pre- and post-intervention. Caregivers were interviewed regarding the effect of the approach. In most cases, participants appeared to enjoy the sessions, actively explored the 360° environment, and shared memories associated with the depicted locations, often spontaneously. There were no cases of significant increases in simulator sickness and psychological and behavioral symptoms during sessions, with only some instances of minor eyestrain, fullness of head, anxiety, irritability, and agitation being detected. Although there were no significant changes in the measured outcomes after intervention, the caregivers assessed the experience as potentially beneficial for most participants. In this study, promoting reminiscences with VR headsets was found to be a safe and engaging experience for people with dementia. However, future studies are required to better understand the added value of immersion, using VR, in reminiscence therapy."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Patients with cerebellar malformations exhibit not only movement problems, but also important deficits in social cognition. Thus, rehabilitation approaches should not only involve the recovery of motor function but also of higher-order abilities such as processing of social stimuli. In keeping with the general role of the cerebellum in anticipating and predicting events, we used a VR-based rehabilitation system to implement a social cognition intensive training specifically tailored to improve predictive abilities in social scenarios (VR-Spirit).\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      The study is an interventional randomised controlled trial that aims to recruit 42 children, adolescents and young adults with congenital cerebellar malformations, randomly allocated to the experimental group or the active control group. The experimental group is administered the VR-Spirit, requiring the participants to compete with different avatars in the reaching of recreational equipment and implicitly prompting them to form expectations about their playing preference. The active control group participates in a VR-training with standard games currently adopted for motor rehabilitation. Both trainings are composed by eight 45-min sessions and are administered in the GRAIL VR laboratory (Motekforce Link, Netherlands), an integrated platform that allows patients to move in natural and attractive VR environments. An evaluation session in VR with the same paradigm used in the VR-Spirit but implemented in a different scenario is administered at the beginning (T0) of the two trainings (T1) and at the end (T2). Moreover, a battery of neurocognitive tests spanning different domains is administered to all participants at T0, T2 and in a follow-up session after 2 months from the end of the two trainings (T3).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This study offers a novel approach for rehabilitation based on specific neural mechanisms of the cerebellum. We aim to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of a new, intensive, social cognition training in a sample of Italian patients aged 7-25 years with congenital cerebellar malformations.

Web-based platforms have the potential to address these needs, although few have been developed for use by both PwD and carers. The CAREGIVERSPRO-MMD platform was developed to provide both user groups with informational and peer-to-peer social support. Platform logging data were analyzed to assess the extent to which PwD (n = 37) and carers (n = 37) engaged with the platform and its social/informational features in their daily lives. Participants also provided feedback on the usefulness and usability of the platform. The majority of PwD and carers found the platform and its social/informational features useful and usable, and significant subsets of both groups utilized the platform regularly. However, carers engaged with the informational and social features to a greater extent than PwD, and users highlighted that PwD typically required regular support to use the platform."

            "abstract": "70 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease were randomly allocated to four groups: 17 patients received only social support, 18 cognitive training twice a week, in 17 cognitive training was combined with pyritinol 2 x 600 mg/day and in 18 cognitive training was combined with phosphatidylserine 2 x 200 mg/day. Treatment duration was 6 months. Before and after treatment, the patients underwent neuropsychological testing as well as measurement of the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose using positron emission tomography and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. Before treatment the groups were comparable in respect to resting and activated glucose pattern achieved by a visual recognition task. Electrophysiological changes were assessed as EEG power, globally and in 4 frequency bands. This 6-month study in four groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease indicated that phosphatidylserine treatment has an effect on different measures of brain function. Since neuropsychological improvements were best documented after 8 and 16 weeks and faded towards the end of the treatment period, it must be concluded that this symptomatic therapy is mainly of short-term benefit and was overcome by the progressive pathological changes at the end of the treatment period.\n"

            "abstract": "Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene inducing abnormal processing and deposition of beta-amyloid protein in the brain have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although Tg2576 mice with the Swedish mutation (hAPPswe) exhibit age-related Abeta-plaque formation in brain regions like the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the cortex, these mice show a rather specific deficit in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks. In view of recent findings showing that neural systems subserving different forms of learning are not simply independent but that depressing or enhancing one system affects learning in another system, we decided to investigate fronto-striatal synaptic plasticity and related procedural learning in these mutants. Fronto-striatal long-term depression (LTD) induced by tetanic stimulation of the cortico-striatal input was similar in Tg2576 and wild-type control mice. Behavioral data, however, pointed to an enhancement of procedural learning in the mutants that showed robust motor-based learning in the cross maze and higher active avoidance scores. Thus, in this mouse model of AD, an intact striatal function associated with an impaired hippocampal function seems to provide neural conditions favorable to procedural learning. Our results suggest that focusing on preserved or enhanced forms of learning in AD patients might be of interest to describe the functional reorganization of the brain when one memory system is selectively compromised by neurological disease."

However, many falls occur while walking and so promoting activity might paradoxically increase fall rates, causing injuries, and worse quality of life. The relationship between activity exposure and fall rates remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between walking activity (exposure to risk) and fall rates before and after an exercise program (V-TIME).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      One hundred and nine older fallers, 38 fallers with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 128 fallers with Parkinson's disease (PD) were randomly assigned to one of two active interventions: treadmill training only or treadmill training combined with a virtual reality component. Participants were tested before and after the interventions. Free-living walking activity was characterized by volume, pattern, and variability of ambulatory bouts using an accelerometer positioned on the lower back for 1 week. To evaluate that relationship between fall risk and activity, a normalized index was determined expressing fall rates relative to activity exposure (FRA index), with higher scores indicating a higher risk of falls per steps taken.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At baseline, the FRA index was higher for fallers with PD compared to those with MCI and older fallers.

This evidence-based analysis reviews magnetoencephalography (MEG), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for the diagnosis or surgical management of the following conditions: Alzheimer's disease (AD), brain tumours, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD).\n    \n\n\n          Clinical need:\n        \n      \n      TARGET POPULATION AND CONDITION Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, degenerative, neurologic condition characterized by cognitive impairment and memory loss. The Canadian Study on Health and Aging estimated that there will be 97,000 incident cases (about 60,000 women) of dementia (including AD) in Canada in 2006. In Ontario, there will be an estimated 950 new cases and 580 deaths due to brain cancer in 2006. Treatments for brain tumours include surgery and radiation therapy. However, one of the limitations of radiation therapy is that it damages tissue though necrosis and scarring. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may not distinguish between radiation effects and resistant tissue, creating a potential role for functional brain imaging. Epilepsy is a chronic disorder that provokes repetitive seizures. In Ontario, the rate of epilepsy is estimated to be 5 cases per 1,000 people. Most people with epilepsy are effectively managed with drug therapy; but about 50% do not respond to drug therapy. Surgical resection of the seizure foci may be considered in these patients, and functional brain imaging may play a role in localizing the seizure foci. Multiple sclerosis is a progressive, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The cause of MS is unknown; however, it is thought to be due to a combination of etiologies, including genetic and environmental components. The prevalence of MS in Canada is 240 cases per 100,000 people. Parkinson's disease is the most prevalent movement disorder; it affects an estimated 100,000 Canadians. Currently, the standard for measuring disease progression is through the use of scales, which are subjective measures of disease progression. Functional brain imaging may provide an objective measure of disease progression, differentiation between parkinsonian syndromes, and response to therapy.\n    \n\n\n          The technology being reviewed:\n        \n      \n      FUNCTIONAL BRAIN IMAGING: Functional brain imaging technologies measure blood flow and metabolism. The results of these tests are often used in conjunction with structural imaging (e.g., MRI or CT). Positron emission tomography and MRS identify abnormalities in brain tissues. The former measures abnormalities through uptake of radiotracers in the brain, while the latter measures chemical shifts in metabolite ratios to identify abnormalities. The potential role of functional MRI (fMRI) is to identify the areas of the brain responsible for language, sensory and motor function (sensorimotor cortex), rather than identifying abnormalities in tissues. Magnetoencephalography measures magnetic fields of the electric currents in the brain, identifying aberrant activity. Magnetoencephalography may have the potential to localize seizure foci and to identify the sensorimotor cortex, visual cortex and auditory cortex. In terms of regulatory status, MEG and PET are licensed by Health Canada. Both MRS and fMRI use a MRI platform; thus, they do not have a separate licence from Health Canada. The radiotracers used in PET scanning are not licensed by Health Canada for general use but can be used through a Clinical Trials Application.\n    \n\n\n          Review strategy:\n        \n      \n      The literature published up to September 2006 was searched in the following databases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, and International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA). The database search was supplemented with a search of relevant Web sites and a review of the bibliographies of selected papers. General inclusion criteria were applied to all conditions. Those criteria included the following: Full reports of systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort-control studies, prospective cohort studies (PCS'), and retrospective studies.Sample sizes of at least 20 patients (≥ 10 with condition being reviewed).English-language studies.Human studies.Any age.STUDYING AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: fMRI, PET, MRS, or MEG.Functional brain imaging modality must be compared with a clearly defined reference standard.MUST REPORT AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES: sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), receiver operating characteristic curve, outcome measuring impact on diagnostic testing, treatment, patient health, or cost.\n    \n\n\n          Summary of findings:\n        \n      \n      There is evidence to indicate that PET can accurately diagnose AD; however, at this time, there is no evidence to suggest that a diagnosis of AD with PET alters the clinical outcomes of patients. The addition of MRS or O-(2-(18)F-Fluoroethyl)-L-Tyrosine (FET)-PET to gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced MRI for distinguishing malignant from benign tumours during primary diagnosis may provide a higher specificity than Gd-enhanced MRI alone. The clinical utility of additional imaging in patients to distinguish malignant from benign tumours is unclear, because patients with a suspected brain tumour will likely undergo a biopsy despite additional imaging results. The addition of MRS, FET-PET, or MRI T2 to Gd-enhanced MRI for the differentiation of recurrence from radiation necrosis may provide a higher specificity than Gd-enhanced MRI alone. The clinical utility of additional imaging in patients with a suspected recurrence is in the monitoring of patients. Based on the evidence available, it is unclear if one of the imaging modalities (MRS, FET-PET, or MRI T2) offers significantly improved specificity over another. There may be a role for fMRI in the identification of surgical candidates for tumour resection; however, this requires further research. Based on the studies available, it is unclear if MEG has similar accuracy in localizing seizure foci to intracranial electroencephalogram (ICEEG). More high-quality research is needed to establish whether there is a difference in accuracy between MEG and ICEEG. The results of the studies comparing PET to noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG) did not demonstrate that PET was more accurate at localizing seizure foci; however, there may be some specific conditions, such as tuberous sclerosis, where PET may be more accurate than noninvasive EEG. There may be some clinical utility for MEG or fMRI in presurgical functional mapping; however, this needs further investigation involving comparisons with other modalities. The clinical utility of MRS has yet to be established for patients with epilepsy. Positron emission tomography has high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of PD and the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes; however, it is unclear at this time if the addition of PET in the diagnosis of these conditions contributes to the treatment and clinical outcomes of patients. There is limited clinical utility of functional brain imaging in the management of patients with MS at this time. Diagnosis of MS is established through clinical history, evoked potentials, and MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging can identify the multifocal white lesions and other structural characteristics of MS."

A single experiment examined recognition performance in the amyloid precursor protein (APP)swe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse, a double-transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and wild type (WT) littermates. Performance on two variants of the spontaneous object recognition (SOR) was compared in 5-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice, a double-transgenic model of AD, and their WT littermates, using junk objects. In the relative recency task animals were exposed to object A, and then object B, followed by a test with both A and B. In the object-in-place task the mice were exposed to both A and B, and then tested with two copies of A, occupying the same positions as the preeexposed objects. The WT mice showed a preference for exploring the first-presented object A in the relative recency task, and the copy of A in the \"wrong\" position (i.e., the one placed where B had been during the preexposure phase) in the object-in-place task. The APP/PS1 mice performed like the WT mice in the relative recency task, but showed a selective impairment in the object-in-place task. We interpret these findings in terms of-Wagner's (Information processing in animals: Memory Mechanisms, 1981, Erlbaum) theory of associative learning, sometimes opponent process (SOP), as a selective deficit in retrieval-generated priming.

            "abstract": "There is increasing interest in the development of economical and accurate approaches to identifying persons in the community who have mild, undetected cognitive impairments. Computerized assessment systems have been suggested as a viable approach to identifying these persons. The validity of a computerized assessment system for identification of memory and executive deficits in older individuals was evaluated in the current study. Volunteers (N = 235) completed a 3-hr battery of neuropsychological tests and a computerized cognitive assessment system. Participants were classified as impaired (n = 78) or unimpaired (n = 157) on the basis of the Mini Mental State Exam, Wechsler Memory Scale-III and the Trail Making Test (TMT), Part B. All six variables (three memory variables and three executive variables) derived from the computerized assessment differed significantly between groups in the expected direction. There was also evidence of temporal stability and concurrent validity. Application of computerized assessment systems for clinical practice and for identification of research participants is discussed in this article."

            "abstract": "An isoflavone was isolated from Trifolium pratense using bioassay-guided screening. The structure of this natural compound was elucidated based on its spectral data, and it was identified as pratensein. The protective effect of pratensein was evaluated using a cognitive impairment model induced by injecting amyloid beta (1-42) (Aβ1-42) into the bilateral hippocampus of rats. The results showed that pratensein treatment significantly protected against Aβ1-42-induced cognitive impairments, as evidenced by the improvement in learning and memory and the attenuation of neuronal degeneration and apoptosis in hippocampus. Analysis of the potential mechanisms of action showed that pratensein significantly decreased inflammatory indicators such as MDA, NO, nNOS, IL-1β and TNF-α. Pratensein markedly decreased the content and deposition of β-amyloid peptide through regulating the expressions of Aβ-related genes including APP, BACE1, CatB, NEP and IDE. Moreover, pratensein significantly increased the expressions of synapse plasticity-related proteins, i.e., PSD-95, p-NMDAR1, p-CaMKII, p-PKACβ, PKCγ, p-CREB and BDNF. In addition, pratensein significantly decreased the activity of cholinesterase, then subsequently elevated the level of acetylcholine. In summary, our study indicated that pratensein may have a likely protective effect against Alzheimer's disease (AD) via improving synaptic plasticity and increasing cholinesterase activity."

Methodological clarity could be improved in subsequent DTA studies of MoCA by reporting findings using recommended guidelines (e.g. STARDdem). Thresholds lower than 26 are likely to be more useful for optimal diagnostic accuracy of MoCA in dementia, but this requires confirmation in further studies."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Studies of developmental deficits in face recognition, or developmental prosopagnosia, have shown that individuals who have not suffered brain damage can show face recognition impairments coupled with normal object recognition (Duchaine and Nakayama, 2005; Duchaine et al., 2006; Nunn et al., 2001). However, no developmental cases with the opposite dissociation - normal face recognition with impaired object recognition - have been reported. The existence of a case of non-face developmental visual agnosia would indicate that the development of normal face recognition mechanisms does not rely on the development of normal object recognition mechanisms.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      To see whether a developmental variant of non-face visual object agnosia exists, we conducted a series of web-based object and face recognition tests to screen for individuals showing object recognition memory impairments but not face recognition impairments.

Testing confirmed that her impairment was not related to a general deficit in lower-level perception, object perception, basic-level recognition, or memory.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      AW's results provide the first neuropsychological evidence that recognition memory for non-face visual object categories can be selectively impaired in individuals without brain damage or other memory impairment. These results indicate that the development of recognition memory for faces does not depend on intact object recognition memory and provide further evidence for category-specific dissociations in visual recognition."

In this study, we analytically validated the performance of assays detecting soluble amyloid-β precursor protein (sAPP) α and β in CSF in two laboratories according to previously standard operating procedures serving this goal. sAPPα and sAPPβ ELISA assays from two vendors (IBL-international, Meso Scale Diagnostics) were validated. The performance parameters included precision, sensitivity, dilutional linearity, recovery, and parallelism. Inter-laboratory variation, biomarker comparison (sAPPα vs. sAPPβ) and clinical performance was determined in three laboratories using 60 samples of patients with subjective memory complaints, Alzheimer's disease, or frontotemporal dementia. All performance parameters of the assays were similar between labs and within predefined acceptance criteria. The only exceptions were minor out-of-range results for recovery at low concentrations and, despite being within predefined acceptance criteria, non-comparability of the results for evaluation of the dilutional linearity and hook-effect. Based on the inter-laboratory correlation between Lab #1 and Lab #2, the IBL-international assays were more robust (sAPPα: r(2) = 0.92, sAPPβ: r(2) = 0.94) than the Meso Scale Diagnostics (MSD) assay (sAPPα: r(2) = 0.70, sAPPβ: r(2) = 0.80). Specificity of assays was confirmed using assay-specific peptide competitors. Clinical validation showed consistent results across the clinical groups in the different laboratories for all assays. The validated sAPP assays appear to be of sufficient technical quality and perform well. Moreover, the study shows that the newly developed standard operating procedures provide highly useful tools for the validation of new biomarker assays. A recommendation was made for renewed instructions to evaluate the dilutional linearity and hook-effect. We analytically validated the performance of assays detecting soluble amyloid-β precursor protein (sAPP) α and β in CSF according to SOPs in agreement with ISO15189 guidelines.

This shift in population consequently results in many social and economic problems, which burden the social and economic systems of countries. The aging process is associated with age-related diseases, the most common of which are dementia and Alzheimer's disease, whose main symptom is a decline in cognitive function, especially memory loss. Unfortunately, it cannot be cured. Therefore, alternative approaches, which are cost-effective, safe, and easy to implement, are being sought in order to delay and prevent cognitive impairment. The purpose of this review was to explore the effect of multidomain lifestyle intervention strategies on the delay and/or prevention of cognitive impairment in healthy older individuals. The methods are based on a literature review of available sources found on the research topic in three acknowledged databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. The results of the identified original studies reveal that multidomain lifestyle interventions generate significant effects. In addition, these interventions seem feasible, cost-effective, and engaging. Thus, there is a call for the implementation of effective lifestyle prevention programs, which would involve goal-setting and would focus on the prevention of crucial risk factors threatening the target group of elderly people, who are at risk of cognitive decline and dementia."

Participants are community-dwelling people with a psychometric diagnosis of MCI based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental Status Test (MMSE). Screening and baseline testing are conducted via a videoconferencing assessment and telephone. Participants are randomly allocated. The treatment phase is 6 months with an open phase in which participants can freely decide to continue to use the CCTs. Additionally, both CCTs contain a monthly computerised cognitive assessment that measures different cognitive abilities: information processing speed, memory span, short term memory, and logical reasoning.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This is the first study to investigate the effect of MAKSCog, an individualised CCT, specifically developed for people with different subtypes of MCI. A methodological strength is the double-blind, randomised, controlled design and the use of basic CCT as an active control group.

            "abstract": "The study of cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD) traditionally requires exhaustive recruitment strategies. The current study examines data collected by the Brain Health Registry (BHR) to determine whether ongoing efforts to improve the recruitment base for therapeutic trials in Alzheimer's disease may be similarly effective for PD research, and whether online cognitive measurements can discriminate between participants who do and do not report a PD diagnosis. Participants enrolled in the BHR (age ≥50) with self-reported PD data and online cognitive testing available were included (n = 11,813). Associations between baseline cognitive variables and diagnostic group were analyzed using logistic regression. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze longitudinal data. A total of 634 participants reported PD diagnosis at baseline with no self-reported cognitive impairment and completed cognitive testing. Measures of visual learning and memory, processing speed, attention, and working memory discriminated between self-reported PD and non-PD participants after correcting for multiple comparisons (p values < 0.006). Scores on all cognitive tests improved over time in PD and controls with the exception of processing speed, which remained stable in participants with PD while improving in those without. We demonstrate that a novel online approach to recruitment and longitudinal follow-up of study participants is effective for those with self-reported PD, and that significant differences exist between those with and without a reported diagnosis of PD on computerized cognitive measures. These results have important implications for recruitment of participants with PD into targeted therapeutic trials or large-scale genetic and cognitive studies."

Methods: Ten individuals with dementia were recruited to complete a cognitive training regimen. They were randomly assigned to a high social interaction (HSI) group (n = 5) and low social interaction (LSI) group (n = 5). Eight of the original 10 participants completed the cognitive training and were evaluated on cognitive abilities, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), and quality of life (QoL). Results: Mean scores for the HSI group increased on cognitive assessments, where mean scores for the LSI group saw decline, or stability. There was an overall reduction in the frequency and severity of NPS presentation in both the HSI and LSI group. Mixed results were found for mean changes in QoL. Discussion: These results support the idea of social interaction influencing cognitive outcomes, cognitive training influencing NPS, and both social interaction and cognitive training influencing QoL. The findings illustrate the feasibility and importance of incorporating social activity to computerized cognitive training for people with dementia. Clinical Implications: Cognitive training that incorporates social interaction may be a promising intervention for individuals with dementia experiencing NPS."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The β-secretase, BACE1, cleaves APP to initiate generation of the β-amyloid peptide, Aβ, that comprises amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reducing BACE1 activity is an attractive therapeutic approach to AD, but complete inhibition of BACE1 could have mechanism-based side-effects as BACE1-/- mice show deficits in axon guidance, myelination, memory, and other neurological processes. Since BACE1+/- mice appear normal there is interest in determining whether 50% reduction in BACE1 is potentially effective in preventing or treating AD. APP transgenic mice heterozygous for BACE1 have decreased Aβ but the extent of reduction varies greatly from study to study. Here we assess the effects of 50% BACE1 reduction on the widely used 5XFAD mouse model of AD.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      50% BACE1 reduction reduces Aβ42, plaques, and BACE1-cleaved APP fragments in female, but not in male, 5XFAD/BACE1+/- mice. 5XFAD/BACE1+/+ females have higher levels of Aβ42 and steady-state transgenic APP than males, likely caused by an estrogen response element in the transgene Thy-1 promoter. We hypothesize that higher transgenic APP level in female 5XFAD mice causes BACE1 to no longer be in excess over APP so that 50% BACE1 reduction has a significant Aβ42 lowering effect. In contrast, the lower APP level in 5XFAD males allows BACE1 to be in excess over APP even at 50% BACE1 reduction, preventing lowering of Aβ42 in 5XFAD/BACE1+/- males. We also developed and validated a dot blot assay with an Aβ42-selective antibody as an accurate and cost-effective alternative to ELISA for measuring cerebral Aβ42 levels.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      50% BACE1 reduction lowers Aβ42 in female 5XFAD mice only, potentially because BACE1 is not in excess over APP in 5XFAD females with higher transgene expression, while BACE1 is in excess over APP in 5XFAD males with lower transgene expression. Our results suggest that greater than 50% BACE1 inhibition might be necessary to significantly lower Aβ, given that BACE1 is likely to be in excess over APP in the human brain. Additionally, in experiments using the 5XFAD mouse model, or other Thy-1 promoter transgenic mice, equal numbers of male and female mice should be used, in order to avoid artifactual gender-related differences."

To address this question, we conducted a review of computerized cognitive training (CCT) interventions in older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Studies were identified using a PubMed and PSYCinfo search for review articles. Within 11 review articles we identified 15 unique studies. Nine of these studies used commercially available \"brain games\" as their primary CCT intervention. Nine of 12 studies that examined the effect of CCT on episodic memory performance showed significant improvements in this domain. Furthermore, four of six studies that examined mood and or anxiety showed improvements in these domains following a CCT intervention. While more than double the amount of time was spent on the training that used commercially available \"brain games\" versus those designed by investigators, there were no differences in outcomes. Overall, it appears that \"brain games\" may modestly benefit aspects of cognition and aspects of mood in patients presenting with MCI. However, there is no direct evidence from the studies presented here that \"brain games\"/CCT can prevent dementia. We present recommendations to consider when discussing \"brain games\" with persons with MCI."

            "abstract": "Protein misfolding and aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, as well as formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the signature hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. To prevent this, molecular chaperones come into play as they facilitate the refolding of the misfolded proteins and cell protection under stress. Here, we have evaluated the possible effects of Ginkgo biloba (GBE) against aggregation of the Aβ through activation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in the Aluminium (Al) induced AD based model. GBE (100 mg/kg body weight) was administered per oral to the female SD rats in conjunction with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of Al lactate (10 mg/kg body weight) for six weeks. Pretreated animals were administered GBE for additional two weeks prior to any exposure of Al. GBE administration resulted in decrease in Aβ aggregation, ubiquitin deposition, accompanying a significant decline in APP & Tau protein hyperphosphorylation which can be attributed to activation of Heat shock factor (HSF-1) and upregulation in the protein expression of HSPs. Histopathological investigation studies have also shown the decrease in aggregation of Aβ peptide by GBE administration. Additionally, the decrease in ROS levels and Aβ aggregation by GBE administration prohibited the decline in the neurotransmitter levels and monoamine oxidase levels in hippocampus and cortex. This further caused improvement in learning and memory of the animals. In conclusion, our results indicate that GBE prevents the symptoms of Al induced AD like pathophysiology by upregulating the HSPs levels and decreasing the aggregation load."

Aging of the population, together with an unhealthy diet and lifestyle, contribute to the steady, global increase of AD patients. This increase creates significant health, societal and economical challenges even for the most developed countries. AD progresses from an asymptomatic stage to a progressively worsening cognitive impairment. The AD cognitive impairment is underpinned by progressive memory impairment, an increasing inability to recall recent events, to execute recently planned actions, and to learn. These changes prevent the AD patient from leading an independent and fulfilling life. Nanotechnology (NT) enables a new, alternative pathway for development of AD treatment interventions. At present, the NT treatments for attenuation of AD memory impairment are at the animal model stage. Over the past four years, there has been a steady increase in publications of AD animal models with a wide variety of original NT treatment interventions, able to attenuate memory impairment. NT therapy development, in animal models of AD, is faced with the twin challenges of the nature of AD, a chronic impairment, unique to human, of the tau protein and A β peptides that regulate several key physiological brain processes, and the incomplete understanding of AD's aetiology. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in NT based treatments for AD memory impairment in animal models and discusses the future work for translation to the successful treatment of AD cognitive impairment in human."

Although both pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies exist, they are often suboptimal. Immersive virtual reality (VR) uses distraction and possible other methods to reduce perceptions of pain. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the usability and acceptability of VR applications in ED patients by assessing patient-reported changes in pain, anger, and anxiety levels.Methods: This is a prospective cohort study at a single academic urban tertiary care center among ED patients with a pain score ≥3 on a numeric rating scale (0-10 integers) for any reason. Patients with stroke, epilepsy, dementia, or other diseases that may prevent use of VR were excluded. Enrolled patients in the intervention cohort spent 20 min using VR applications. A paired t test was used to analyze the change of pain, anger, and anxiety scores between pre- and postintervention. Analysis of variance and linear regression were used to assess the impact of other subject variables (including gender, age, race, and education) on pre-post intervention changes.Results: One hundred (N = 100) patients were enrolled in this study and 93 experienced the VR intervention. Of these, 57 (61.3%) were women, and mean age was 38 ± 14. Mean anger (2.28 ± 0.8 to 1.92 ± 0.7, p < 0.0001), anxiety (2.06 ± 0.8 to 1.81 ± 0.8, p < 0.0001), and pain (7.16 ± 2.5 to 6.49 ± 2.7, p < 0.0001) levels dropped significantly from pre- to postintervention. Outcomes of the VR intervention were impacted by subject variables, including education and ethnicity. Pain (1.86 ± 3.3, p = 0.03) and anger (1.03 ± 1.4, p = 0.02) levels dropped most for those with less than high school education.

A set of novel Web-enabled computerized tests has recently been shown to be valid for identifying mild cognitive impairment and characterizing the cognitive profile associated with various disorders. It was anticipated that these tests would be well suited for use in children with ADHD. The authors tested this idea in a pilot study of 15 children (12 males, 3 females; mean age, 11 years 10 months; range, 9-15 years) with ADHD and 15 age-, education-, and gender-matched controls. The profile of cognitive impairment in ADHD children off methylphenidate across 6 cognitive domains (memory, executive function, visual-spatial skills, verbal function, attention, and motor skills) was described relative to controls. The effect of treatment with methylphenidate was examined by comparing the ADHD children on methylphenidate and on placebo (administered in a double-blind randomized fashion) relative to controls and by comparing the ADHD children on methylphenidate relative to placebo. Significant impairment in ADHD was evident in memory, visual-spatial, verbal, and attention domains, and near-significant impairment was observed in executive function and motor skills. On methylphenidate but not placebo, performance was comparable to controls in immediate verbal memory, psychomotor accuracy, visual-spatial, verbal rhyming, and overall battery performance. Significant improvement with administration of methylphenidate relative to placebo was evident for psychomotor accuracy, verbal rhyming, and overall battery performance. Hence, on the limited basis of this pilot study, the set of computerized tests studied appears to be useful for measuring cognitive function in ADHD; however, additional studies are needed to confirm this."

            "abstract": "The coronavirus disease pandemic has brought a new urgency for the development and deployment of web-based applications which complement, and offer alternatives to, traditional one-on-one consultations and pencil-and-paper (PaP) based assessments that currently dominate clinical research. We have recently developed a web-based application that can be used for the self-administered collection of patient demographics, self-rated health, depression and anxiety, and cognition as part of a single platform. In this study we report the findings from a study with 155 cognitively healthy older adults who received established PaP versions, as well as our novel computerized measures of self-rated health, depression and anxiety, and cognition. Moderate to high correlations were observed between PaP and web- based measures of self-rated health (r = 0.77), depression and anxiety (r = 0.72), and preclinical Alzheimer's disease cognitive composite (PACC) (r = .61). Test-retest correlations were variable with high correlations for a measure of processing speed and a measure of delayed episodic memory. Taken together, these data support the feasibility and validity of utilization of this novel web-based platform as a new alternative for collecting patient demographics and the assessment of self-rated health, depression and anxiety, and cognition in the elderly."

Animal-like social robots are increasingly used in dementia care as they can provide companionship and engage PWD in meaningful activities. While most previous human-robot interaction (HRI) research studied engagement independent from the context, recent findings indicate that the context of HRI sessions has an impact on user engagement. This study aims to explore the effects of contextual interactions between PWD and a social robot embedded in the augmented responsive environment. Three experimental conditions were compared: reactive context-enhanced robot interaction; dynamic context-enhanced interaction with a static robot; a control condition with only the dynamic context presented. Effectiveness evaluations were performed with 16 participants using four observational rating scales on observed engagement, affective states, and apathy related behaviors. Findings suggested that the higher level of interactivity of a social robot and the interactive contextualized feedback helped capture and maintain users' attention during engagement; however, it did not significantly improve their positive affective states. Additionally, the presence of either a static or a proactive robot reduced apathy-related behaviors by facilitating purposeful activities, thus, motivating behavioral engagement."

Currently, the only pharmacological treatments available for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in PD provide variable benefit, making the search for potential non-pharmacological therapies to improve cognitive function of significant interest. One such therapeutic strategy may be cognitive training (CT), which involves the repetition of standardized tasks with the aim of improving specific aspects of cognition. Several studies have examined the effects of CT in individuals with PD and have shown benefits in a variety of cognitive domains, but the widespread use of CT in these individuals may be limited by motor impairments and other concerns in study design. Here, we discuss the current state of the literature on the use of CT for PD and propose recommendations for future implementation. We also explore the potential use of more recent integrative, adaptive and assistive technologies, such as virtual reality, which may optimize the delivery of CT in PD."

We subsequently searched paper reference lists and contacted authors if data were missing. Three reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed study quality using an adapted version of the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal tool. Twenty-one studies including 944 participants were found. No one test appears more accurate, with similar validities as in-person testing. Cut-offs for screening differed between studies based on demographics and acceptability thresholds and meta-analysis was not appropriate. Overall the results suggest telephone screening is acceptably sensitive and specific however, given the limited data, this finding must be treated with some caution.

Neuronal death, regardless of causes, plays a key role in AD progression, and it is directly linked to neuroinflammation. Meanwhile, phenotypic screening is making a resurgence in drug discovery process as an alternative to target-focused approaches. Herein, we employed microglia-based phenotypic screenings to search for small molecules that modulate the release of detrimental proinflammatory cytokines. The identified novel pharmacological inhibitor of neuroinflammation (named GIBH-130) was validated to alter phenotypes of neuroinflammation in AD brains. Notably, this molecule exhibited comparable in vivo efficacy of cognitive impairment relief to donepezil and memantine respectively in both β amyloid-induced and APP/PS1 double transgenic Alzheimer's murine models at a substantially lower dose (0.25 mg/kg). Therefore, GIBH-130 constitutes a unique chemical probe for pathogenesis research and drug development of AD, and it also suggests microglia-based phenotypic screenings that target neuroinflammation as an effective and feasible strategy to identify novel anti-AD agents."

            "abstract": "Mindfulness attracted increased research interests in the last decade, reporting an overall beneficial effect of this practice on cognitive performances. Nevertheless, recently a possible detrimental impact of mindfulness has been underlined. While the effect of mindfulness on memory remains under-explored, recent studies have observed an increased false-memory susceptibility after mindfulness practice. A possible explanatory mechanism has been suggested, related to the nature of the studied material. For semantically related information, mindfulness would increase false memories; however, the addition of rich perceptual information could prevent this detrimental effect. The present study aimed to verify this hypothesis by testing the impact of state mindfulness induced by a short meditation session, and dispositional mindfulness on the production of false memory for pictorial material presented in a complex virtual environment. We employed a virtual reality version of the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm (DRM), a classical protocol to induce false memories. Contrary to previous studies, we did not observe any effect of mindfulness on false or correct memories (free recall and recognition) after a short mindfulness practice session compared to a control condition. Nonetheless, we found a beneficial effect of mindfulness practice on memory sensitivity. Additionally, we reported a positive and negative effect of dispositional mindfulness on memory outcomes. While the Non-Reactivity facet was associated with overall better memory performances, we observed an association between the Acting with Awareness facet and an increased recollection of lures. We discuss these findings in line with a recent proposal on the link between mindfulness and episodic memory."

            "abstract": "The increasing number of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease raises the question of their caring at home, especially when the disease causes disability and negative consequences in daily life such as isolation, falls, wandering, errors in drug taking. Furthermore, caregivers bear a substantial burden that can have adverse effects on their physical and mental health. New technologies of information could play an additional role as care providers without substituting family or professional caregivers help. A review of literature focused on the different technological solutions conceived for patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and their carers shows that these appliances could help to provide reminders in daily life (drugs, tasks and appointments, meals cooking), to activate residual cognitive resources by computerized cognitive stimulation intervention, to reduce stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients by visual contact with families and professionals (webconference), to contribute to patients safety by detecting falls and wandering, and to help families in the caring of patients with computerized information and counselling interventions. We also discuss the current limitations for a widespread use of these technologies and outline future research avenues. True needs of end-users are still poorly known and should be more clearly defined. Simplicity of the use of these appliances should be further improved. Demonstration of medical and social benefits for elderly people should be carried out in randomized, controlled studies. Ethical reflexion should be developed in conjunction with the use of these gerontechnologies. Finally, the economical model which would enable the providing of these appliances to the largest number of patients and caregivers should be implemented. Although these gerontechnologies are promising, research is still needed to tailor them properly to the needs of end-users, assess their benefit in ecological context of people with Alzheimer's disease in order to provide them with appropriate tools in daily life."

            "abstract": "Social isolation is likely to be recommended for older adults due to COVID-19, with ongoing reduced clinical contact suggested for this population. This has increased the need for remote memory clinics, we therefore review the literature, current practices and guidelines on organizing such remote memory clinics, focusing on assessment of cognition, function and other relevant measurements, proposing a novel pathway based on three levels of complexity: simple telephone or video-based interviews and testing using available tests (Level 1), digitized and validated methods based on standard pen-and-paper tests and scales (Level 2), and finally fully digitized cognitive batteries and remote measurement technologies (RMTs, Level 3). Pros and cons of these strategies are discussed. Remotely collected data negates the need for frail patients or carers to commute to clinic and offers valuable insights into progression over time, as well as treatment responses to therapeutic interventions, providing a more realistic and contextualized environment for data-collection. Notwithstanding several challenges related to internet access, computer skills, limited evidence base and regulatory and data protection issues, digital biomarkers collected remotely have significant potential for diagnosis and symptom management in older adults and we propose a framework and pathway for how technologies can be implemented to support remote memory clinics. These platforms are also well-placed for administration of digital cognitive training and other interventions. The individual, societal and public/private costs of COVID-19 are high and will continue to rise for some time but the challenges the pandemic has placed on memory services also provides an opportunity to embrace novel approaches. Remote memory clinics' financial, logistical, clinical and practical benefits have been highlighted by COVID-19, supporting their use to not only be maintained when social distancing legislation is lifted but to be devoted extra resources and attention to fully potentiate this valuable arm of clinical assessment and care."

However, there is no gold standard assessment for spatial orientation and paper-and-pencil tests lack ecological validity. Recently, there has been an increasing number of studies demonstrating the role of spatial disorientation as a cognitive marker of pathological decline, shedding new light on its importance for MCI. This systematic review aimed to investigate the accuracy of spatial orientation tasks for the diagnosis of MCI by comparison with cognitively healthy elderly. The search was conducted in the databases Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE/PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, Excerpta Medica Database (Embase), Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (Lilacs) and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO). Only original studies reporting spatial orientation assessment in MCI patients compared to a healthy control group were included. Studies were excluded if the MCI classification did not follow well described criteria and/or if accuracy results of spatial orientation assessment were not provided. Seven studies met the eligibility criteria, describing a variety of spatial orientation assessments including questionnaires, paper-and-pencil, office-based route learning, and computer-based and virtual reality tasks. Spatial orientation tasks demonstrated moderate to high accuracy in detecting elderly with MCI compared to cognitively healthy elderly, with areas under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.77 to 0.99. However, important methodological issues were found in the selected studies which should be considered when interpreting results. Although the inclusion of spatial orientation assessments in MCI evaluations seems to have significant value, further studies are needed to clarify their true capacity to distinguish pathological from non-pathological aging."

            "abstract": "Extensive evidence has indicated that a high rate of cholesterol biogenesis and abnormal neuronal energy metabolism play key roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Here, for we believe the first time, we used osmotin, a plant protein homolog of mammalian adiponectin, to determine its therapeutic efficacy in different AD models. Our results reveal that osmotin treatment modulated adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1), significantly induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activation and reduced SREBP2 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2) expression in both in vitro and in vivo AD models and in Adipo-/- mice. Via the AdipoR1/AMPK/SIRT1/SREBP2 signaling pathway, osmotin significantly diminished amyloidogenic Aβ production, abundance and aggregation, accompanied by improved pre- and post-synaptic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, memory deficits and, most importantly, reversed the suppression of long-term potentiation in AD mice. Interestingly, AdipoR1, AMPK and SIRT1 silencing not only abolished osmotin capability but also further enhanced AD pathology by increasing SREBP2, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-secretase (BACE1) expression and the levels of toxic Aβ production. However, the opposite was true for SREBP2 when silenced using small interfering RNA in APPswe/ind-transfected SH-SY5Y cells. Similarly, osmotin treatment also enhanced the non-amyloidogenic pathway by activating the α-secretase gene that is, ADAM10, in an AMPK/SIRT1-dependent manner. These results suggest that osmotin or osmotin-based therapeutic agents might be potential candidates for AD treatment."

Post-concussive syndrome can be associated with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). There is to date no recommendation on the interventions that could be done to reduce post-concussive syndrome.

Regression analyses indicated an inverse relationship between PCS scores and performances on several CogSport subtests. Severity of PCS also predicted fMRI blood oxygen level dependent signal changes in cerebral prefrontal regions.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Self-reported PCS is associated with an ongoing cerebral haemodynamic abnormality as well as with mild cognitive impairment. These results support the use of the PCS scale in the assessment of cerebral concussion and in monitoring recovery."

            "abstract": "Background. Cognitive impairments are common in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Systematic reviews reported promising evidence for various cognitive interventions in this population. Computerized cognitive training (CCT) has strong evidence for safety and efficacy in several populations, but its effects in MS have yet to be specified. Objective. We aimed to synthesize the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of CCT on cognitive, psychosocial, and functional outcomes in adults with MS. Method. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and CENTRAL from inception to March 2019. We calculated standardized mean difference (Hedges' g) of change from baseline in untrained measures of cognition, individual domains, psychosocial functioning, and daily function between CCT and control groups using a random-effects model. Results. A total of 20 RCTs encompassing 982 participants (78% with relapsing-remitting MS) were included. The overall cognitive effect size was moderate (g = 0.30; 95% CI = 0.18-0.43), with no evidence of small-study effect or between-study heterogeneity (prediction interval = 0.17-0.44). Small to moderate effect sizes were found for attention/processing speed, executive functions, and verbal and visuospatial memory. Evidence for working memory, fatigue, and psychosocial and daily functioning were inconclusive. Cognitive effects waned without further training. Conclusions. CCT is efficacious for overall and key cognitive domains in adults with MS, but efficacy on other outcomes and in progressive subtypes remains unclear. Long-term and well-powered trials with diverse cohorts are needed to optimize and maintain the efficacy of CCT, investigate transfer to daily living, and determine who can benefit and whether CCT is a cost-effective strategy to attenuate cognitive decline in MS."

            "abstract": "Objective: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a broad term for people at a stage between normal age-related cognitive decline and dementia, where cognitive problems are present but do not impair activities of daily living. This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR)-based rehabilitation program on cognitive functions in MCI. Materials and Methods: Sixty-one older adults (25 men, 36 women) with MCI were randomized to the intervention group (n = 30; 70.12 ± 2.57 years) or control (n = 31; 70.30 ± 2.73 years) group. The intervention group received a VR (computer-generated interactive environments) intervention in addition to a conventional cognitive rehabilitation (CR) intervention, whereas the control group received only the CR intervention. Cognitive functions were assessed in both groups before and after the 12-week interventions by using the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment-Geriatric. Results: Between-group comparisons revealed significantly greater improvements in orientation, visual-spatial perception, visuomotor organization, thinking operation, and attention/concentration functions in the VR group than in the control group (P < 0.001 for all). Conclusion: Our results showed that 12 weeks of VR-based rehabilitation enhanced cognitive functions in older adults with MCI. Using VR applications in CR is recommended to improve cognitive functions of older adults with MCI."

Attributed to the shortage of medical staff, automatic diagnosis of AD has become more important to relieve the workload of medical staff and increase the accuracy of medical diagnoses. Using the common MRI scans as inputs, an AD detection model has been designed using convolutional neural network (CNN). To enhance the fine-tuning of hyperparameters and, thus, the detection accuracy, transfer learning (TL) is introduced, which brings the domain knowledge from heterogeneous datasets. Generative adversarial network (GAN) is applied to generate additional training data in the minority classes of the benchmark datasets. Performance evaluation and analysis using three benchmark (OASIS-series) datasets revealed the effectiveness of the proposed method, which increases the accuracy of the detection model by 2.85−3.88%, 2.43−2.66%, and 1.8−40.1% in the ablation study of GAN and TL, as well as the comparison with existing works, respectively."

Cognitive decline and dementia are significant threats to independence and quality of life in older adults. Therefore, identifying interventions that help to maintain cognitive function in older adults or to reduce the risk of dementia is a research priority. Cognitive training uses repeated practice on standardised exercises targeting one or more cognitive domains and is intended to maintain optimum cognitive function. This review examines the effect of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks on the cognitive function of healthy adults aged 65 or older.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effects of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks for the maintenance or improvement of cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in late life.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched to 31 March 2018 in ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois) and performed additional searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP (www.apps.who.int/trialsearch) to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and as up-to-date as possible, to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, published or unpublished, reported in any language. Participants were cognitively healthy people, and at least 80% of the study population had to be aged 65 or older. Experimental interventions adhered to the following criteria: intervention was any form of interactive computerised cognitive intervention - including computer exercises, computer games, mobile devices, gaming console, and virtual reality - that involved repeated practice on standardised exercises of specified cognitive domain(s) for the purpose of enhancing cognitive function; duration of the intervention was at least 12 weeks; cognitive outcomes were measured; and cognitive training interventions were compared with active or inactive control interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We performed preliminary screening of search results using a 'crowdsourcing' method to identify RCTs. At least two review authors working independently screened the remaining citations against inclusion criteria. At least two review authors also independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included RCTs. Where appropriate, we synthesised data in random-effect meta-analyses, comparing computerised cognitive training (CCT) separately with active and inactive controls. We expressed treatment effects as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE methods to describe the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified eight RCTs with a total of 1183 participants. Researchers provided interventions over 12 to 26 weeks; in five trials, the duration of intervention was 12 or 13 weeks. The included studies had a moderate risk of bias. Review authors noted a lot of inconsistency between trial results. The overall quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes.We compared CCT first against active control interventions, such as watching educational videos. Because of the very low quality of the evidence, we were unable to determine any effect of CCT on our primary outcome of global cognitive function or on secondary outcomes of episodic memory, speed of processing, executive function, and working memory.We also compared CCT versus inactive control (no interventions). Negative SMDs favour CCT over control. We found no studies on our primary outcome of global cognitive function. In terms of our secondary outcomes, trial results suggest slight improvement in episodic memory (mean difference (MD) -0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.73 to -0.07; 150 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence) and no effect on executive function (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.15; 292 participants; 2 studies; low-quality evidence), working memory (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.27; 60 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence), or verbal fluency (MD -0.11, 95% CI -1.58 to 1.36; 150 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence). We could not determine any effects on speed of processing at trial endpoints because the evidence was of very low quality.We found no evidence on quality of life, activities of daily living, or adverse effects in either comparison.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found little evidence from the included studies to suggest that 12 or more weeks of CCT improves cognition in healthy older adults. However, our limited confidence in the results reflects the overall quality of the evidence. Inconsistency between trials was a major limitation. In five of the eight trials, the duration of intervention was just three months. The possibility that longer periods of training could be beneficial remains to be more fully explored."

Method: Thirty-one participants underwent individualized CogT (focussing on one or two cognitive domains: working memory, inhibition, attention) over 12 weeks. NP tests and behaviour ratings served as outcome measures. Results: After CogT, significant improvements emerged according to parents' ratings, but only on very few NP test measures. Children with milder/no pre-training NP impairment showed larger improvements on behavioural ratings than more impaired children. A steeper training performance slope was related to better behavioural outcomes. Conclusion: We find partial support for specific effects of CogT, but the assumption that an individually tailored selection of training tasks would be particularly beneficial for children with ADHD with NP deficits was not confirmed.

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementia with early (≤65 years) and late (>65 years) onset ages in familial and sporadic patients. Causal mutations in 3 autosomal dominant Alzheimer genes, i.e. amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), explain only 5%-10% of early-onset patients leaving the majority of patients genetically unresolved. To discover potential missing genetics, we used whole genome sequencing data of 17 early-onset patients with well-documented clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In the discovery group, the mean onset age was 55.71 ± 6.83 years (range 37-65). Six patients had a brain autopsy and neuropathology confirmed Alzheimer's disease. Analysis of the genetic data identified in one patient a homozygous p.V366M missense mutation in the Von Willebrand factor A domain containing 2 gene (VWA2). Resequencing of the VWA2 coding region in an Alzheimer's disease patient cohort from Flanders-Belgium (n = 1148), including 152 early and 996 late onset patients, identified additional homozygous and compound heterozygous missense mutations in 1 early and 3 late-onset patients. Allele-sharing analysis identified common haplotypes among the compound heterozygous VWA2 mutation carriers, suggesting shared ancestors. Overall, we identified 5 patient carriers of homozygous or compound heterozygous missense mutations (5/1165; 0.43 %), 2 in early (2/169; 1.18 %) and 3 in late-onset (3/996; 0.30 %) patients. The frequencies of the homozygous and compound heterozygous missense mutations in patients are higher than expected from the frequencies calculated based on their combined single alleles. None of the homozygous/compound heterozygous missense mutation carriers had a family history of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest that homozygous and compound heterozygous missense mutations in VWA2 might contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's disease in sporadic patients."

            "abstract": "Dementia of any type is incurable and treatment is primarily focused on slowing its progression and managing symptoms, typically accomplished through a combination of medication and lifestyle factors. Social workers are uniquely positioned to suggest new and innovative strategies for improving the quality of life. Technology opens a variety of options, and virtual reality is one of the more recent additions to the available toolkit. This review describes the state of the literature as it relates to the use of immersive virtual reality technology with persons with dementia. One hundred fifty-eight articles were returned by keyword search, but just three of those used modern virtual reality systems. Each of the three studies found positive results in their respective uses of virtual reality with persons with dementia. VR was well tolerated by participants and engagement was high, though sample sizes were small across studies. Results demonstrated immersive VR is a viable pathway for a variety of novel interventions with this population, but more research using modern immersive devices is required. Social workers in a variety of care settings can build on these early findings and develop an array of novel palliative and leisure-time experiences for this population."

Main objective of this study was to investigate effects of virtual shopping training on executive function and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in patients with MCI. 32 patients with MCI were randomly assigned to the experimental group that received virtual shopping training or the waitlist control group for a total of 16 sessions. To examine effects of virtual shopping training on executive function and IADL, Korean version of the Executive Function Performance Test (EFPT-K) and Korean Instrumental Activities of Daily living (K-IADL) were conducted. After the 16 sessions, the experimental group showed greater improvement in the EFPT-K (p < 0.001) and the K-IADL (p < 0.001) compared to the control group.

            "abstract": "ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) transporter regulates cholesterol efflux and is an essential mediator of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) formation. In amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice, Abca1 deficiency increased amyloid deposition in the brain paralleled by decreased levels of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE). The APOEε4 allele is the major genetic risk factor of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we reveal the effect of Abca1 deficiency on phenotype in mice expressing human ApoE3 or ApoE4. We used APP/E3 and APP/E4 mice generated by crossing APP/PS1ΔE9 transgenic mice to human APOE3- and APOE4-targeted replacement mice and examined Abca1 gene dose effect on amyloid deposition and cognition. The results from two behavior tests demonstrate that lack of one copy of Abca1 significantly exacerbates memory deficits in APP/E4/Abca1(-/+) but not in APP/E3/Abca1(-/+) mice. The data for amyloid plaques and insoluble amyloid-β (Aβ) also show that Abca1 hemizygosity increases Aβ deposition only in APP/E4/Abca1(-/+) but not in APP/E3/Abca1(-/+) mice. Our in vivo microdialysis assays indicate that Abca1 deficiency significantly decreases Aβ clearance in ApoE4-expressing mice, while the effect of Abca1 on Aβ clearance in ApoE3-expressing mice was insignificant. In addition, we demonstrate that plasma HDL and Aβ42 levels in APP/E4/Abca1(-/+) mice are significantly decreased, and there is a negative correlation between plasma HDL and amyloid plaques in brain, suggesting that plasma lipoproteins may be involved in Aβ clearance. Overall, our results prove that the presence of functional Abca1 significantly influences the phenotype of APP mice expressing human ApoE4 and further substantiate therapeutic approaches in AD based on ABCA1-APOE regulatory axis."

            "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the older population globally, it is anticipated that age-related cognitive decline in the prodromal phase and more severe pathological decline will increase. Moreover, currently, no effective treatment options for the disease exist. Thus, early and timely prevention actions are promising and prior strategies to preserve cognitive functions by preventing symptomatology from increasing the age-related deterioration of the functions in healthy older adults. This study aims to develop the virtual reality-based cognitive intervention for enhancing executive functions (EFs) and examine the EFs after training with the virtual reality-based cognitive intervention in community-dwelling older adults. Following inclusion/exclusion criteria, 60 community-dwelling older adults aged 60-69 years were involved in the study and randomly divided into passive control and experimental groups. Eight 60 min virtual reality-based cognitive intervention sessions were held twice a week and lasted for 1 month. The EFs (i.e., inhibition, updating, and shifting) of the participants were assessed by using standardized computerized tasks, i.e., Go/NoGo, forward and backward digit span, and Berg's card sorting tasks. Additionally, a repeated-measure ANCOVA and effect sizes were applied to investigate the effects of the developed intervention. The virtual reality-based intervention significantly improved the EFs of older adults in the experimental group. Specifically, the magnitudes of enhancement were observed for inhibitory as indexed by the response time, F(1) = 6.95, p < .05, ηp2 = .11, updating as represented by the memory span, F(1) = 12.09, p < .01, ηp2 = .18, and the response time, F(1) = 4.46, p = .04, ηp2 = .07, and shifting abilities as indexed by the percentage of correct responses, F(1) = 5.30, p = .03, ηp2 = .09, respectively. The results indicated that the simultaneous combined cognitive-motor control as embedded in the virtual-based intervention is safe and effective in enhancing EFs in older adults without cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, further studies are required to investigate the benefits of these enhancements to motor functions and emotional aspects relating to daily living and the well-being of older populations in communities."

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurological syndrome in which language functions become progressively impaired with relative sparing of memory and other instrumental functions. The pathologic causes of PPA are heterogeneous, but studies suggest that logopenic PPA (LPA) is underpinned by Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology in a high proportion of cases. The purposes of this descriptive and retrospective study were to characterize F-florbetapir PET imaging in a group of patients with a clinical syndrome of PPA, to determine the value of clinical characterization based on language phenotype in predicting the underlying pathology of PPA with F-florbetapir, and to quantify amyloid load in PPA subjects classified as \"positive\" F-florbetapir scans. Then, we compare the quantification and distribution of F-florbetapir uptake with those of typical, predominantly amnestic AD patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a PET study with F-florbetapir in a cohort of 12 right-handed patients diagnosed with PPA: 3 patients with semantic-variant PPA, 5 with nonfluent PPA, 1 with LPA, and 3 unclassifiable patients. We evaluated amyloid deposition between APP groups and 11 patients with typical amnestic AD.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Among the 12 patients with PPA syndrome, 8 (66.7%) were considered as amyloid positive. One of the 3 patients with semantic-variant PPA was F-florbetapir positive. In contrast, 4 of the 5 nonfluent-variant PPA, 2 of the 3 unclassifiable cases and the single patient with LPA were F-florbetapir positive. A significantly higher F-florbetapir uptake was observed in PPA F-florbetapir-positive patients compared with typical AD patients. This difference was observed in all regions of interest, except in posterior cingulate and temporal cortex.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These results suggest that F-florbetapir PET may be useful in a routine clinical procedure to improve the reliability of identifying AD pathology in patients with PPA syndrome, with different clinical subtypes of the PPA syndrome."

            "abstract": "The case of a 61 year old patient with Pick's disease involving predominantly the left temporal lobe, who has been studied over a 5 year period, is reported. She presented with a grave impairment of both verbal and non-verbal memory functions. Her non-verbal memory deficits included profound impairments on the recognition of unfamiliar faces and the recall of abstract designs. Remarkably, her visual recognition memory performance for unknown buildings, landscapes, and outdoor scenes was preserved. Strikingly, her ability to recall familiar routes and learn new ones through a complex virtual reality town was also entirely normal. This seems to be the first case documenting the selective preservation of topographical memory in the context of severe non-verbal and verbal memory impairments. These findings imply that topographical memory and non-verbal memory are subserved by separable neural systems."

We developed a new computerized cognitive rehabilitation program (Bettercog) that contained various treatment programs for cognitive training for mild cognitive impairment or dementia. This study was conducted to compare the clinical efficacy of Bettercog and computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation (COMCOG) that has had clinical efficacy previously proven in patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Randomized, single-blind comparison pilot study of 20 elderly patients with cognitive decline-eight men and 12 women-with an average age of 74.3 years. Bettercog trains not only memory and attention but also orientation, calculation, executive function, language, comprehension, and spatiotemporal abilities. To retain subjects' interest, pictures, animations, and game elements were introduced. The subjects were divided into COMCOG and Bettercog groups by random assignment and underwent 12 sessions of a computerized cognitive rehabilitation program for three weeks. In a separate space, an independent clinical psychologist conducted the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery 2nd edition (SNSB-II), Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and the Korean version of the Modified Barthel Index (K-MBI) before and after treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was no significant difference between the two groups in baseline age, sex, illiteracy, years of education, and scores on the K-MMSE, CDR, SNSB-II, and K-MBI. In the posttreatment cognitive assessment, the K-MMSE scores of patients treated with Bettercog improved from 19.2 ± 3.9 to 21.3 ± 4.0 (P = .005). In the memory domain of the SNSB-II, the percentile score improved from 15.3 ± 24.5 to 24.2 ± 30.7 (P = .026). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the final K-MMSE, CDR, and SNSB-II scores between the two treatment groups.

Approaches include stem cell transplantation, which improved memory in several animal studies as well as vaccination against Alzheimer´s disease (AD) by β-amyloid antibodies. For a positive clinical effect, the vaccine should probably be administered over a long period of time and before amyloid pathologies manifest in the brain. Different drugs, such as erythropoietin or antiplatelet therapy, improve memory in neuropsychiatric diseases or AD or at least in animal studies. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid-rich diets improve memory through the gut-brain axis by altering the gut flora through probiotics. Sports, dancing, and memory techniques (e.g., Method of Loci) utilize behavioral approaches for memory enhancement, and were effective in several studies. Augmented reality (AR) is an auspicious way for enhancing memory in real time. Future approaches may include memory prosthesis for head-injured patients and light therapy for restoring memory in AD. Memory enhancement in humans in health and disease holds big promises for the future. Memory training helps only in mild or no impairment. Clinical application requires further investigation."

In this paper we provide an overview of the role of technology in dementia care, treatment and support by mapping existing technologies - by function, target user and disease progression. Technologies identified are classified into seven functions: memory support, treatment, safety and security, training, care delivery, social interaction and other. Different groups of potential users are distinguished: people with mild cognitive impairment and early stages of dementia, people with moderate to severe dementia and unpaid carers and health- and social care professionals. We also identified the care settings, in which the technologies are used (or for which the technologies are developed): at home in the community and in institutional care settings. The evidence has been drawn from a rapid review of the literature, expert interviews and web and social media searches. The largest number of technologies identified aim to enhance the safety and security of people with dementia living in the community. These devices are often passive monitors, such as smoke detectors. Other safety interventions, such as panic buttons, require active intervention. The second largest number of interventions aims to enhance people's memory and includes global positioning systems devices and voice prompts. These technologies mostly target people in the early stages of dementia. A third group focusing on treatment and care delivery emerged from the literature. These interventions focus on technology-aided reminiscence or therapeutic aspects of care for people with dementia and their carers. While the review found a range of technologies available for people with dementia and carers there is very little evidence of widespread practical application. Instead, it appears that stakeholders frequently rely on everyday technologies re-purposed to meet their needs."

Participants fully adhered to a mean of 2 out of the 4 taught intervention components. Eighty-nine percent of participants were at least partially adherent to one or more taught intervention components at 6-, 12-, and 18-month post-intervention follow-up. Physical activity was the most adhered to intervention while group support was the least adhered to intervention across all three follow-up time-points. Higher educational level, higher baseline depressive symptoms, higher baseline global cognitive functioning, and better baseline and concurrent functional abilities were associated post-intervention adherence.Conclusion: Changes in functional abilities are associated with disease progression among persons with aMCI. In the present study, individuals with aMCI who have higher education, higher depressive symptoms, and better baseline functioning abilities are more likely to adhere to behavioral intervention components over time.

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to produce the toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Accumulation of Aβ, together with the concomitant inflammatory response, ultimately leads to neuronal death and cognitive decline. Despite AD progression being underpinned by both neuronal and immunological components, therapeutic strategies based on dual targeting of these systems remains unexplored. Here, we report that inactivation of the p110δ isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) reduces anterograde axonal trafficking of APP in hippocampal neurons and dampens secretion of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha by microglial cells in the familial AD APPswe/PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model. Moreover, APP/PS1 mice with kinase-inactive PI3Kδ (δD910A) had reduced Aβ peptides levels and plaques in the brain and an abrogated inflammatory response compared with APP/PS1 littermates. Mechanistic investigations reveal that PI3Kδ inhibition decreases the axonal transport of APP by eliciting the formation of highly elongated tubular-shaped APP-containing carriers, reducing the levels of secreted Aβ peptide. Importantly, APP/PS1/δD910A mice exhibited no spatial learning or memory deficits. Our data highlight inhibition of PI3Kδ as a new approach to protect against AD pathology due to its dual action of dampening microglial-dependent neuroinflammation and reducing plaque burden by inhibition of neuronal APP trafficking and processing.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT During Alzheimer's disease (AD), the accumulation of the toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide in plaques is associated with a chronic excessive inflammatory response. Uncovering new drug targets that simultaneously reduce both Aβ plaque load and neuroinflammation holds therapeutic promise. Using a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches, we found that the p110δ isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is involved in anterograde trafficking of the amyloid precursor protein in neurons and in the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha from microglial cells. Genetic inactivation of PI3Kδ reduces Aβ plaque deposition and abrogates the inflammatory response, resulting in a complete rescue of the life span and spatial memory performance. We conclude that inhibiting PI3Kδ represents a novel therapeutic approach to ameliorate AD pathology by dampening plaque accumulation and microglial-dependent neuroinflammation."

Cognitive rehabilitation intervention consisted of two 40-minute sessions per week. All patients were tested with the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis battery, the Stroop Color-Word Test, and the trail making test, while the Beck Depression Inventory - Fast Screen questionnaire was used as a measure of mood and the cognitive reserve index as a measure of cognitive reserve. We used the reliable change index, to calculate clinically meaningful changes of performance, and to discriminate between responders and non-responders of this intervention. Statistically significant improvement of the group receiving treatment was observed mainly on measures of verbal and non-verbal episodic memory and, to a lesser extent, on reading speed, selective attention/response inhibition, and visual attention.

The ES for studies using semi-immersive technology (ES = 0.37, CI = 0.25, 0.49) was greater than the studies using full-immersive VR (ES = 0.03, CI = -0.14, 0.21). The results showed small-to-medium effects for VR interventions affecting key outcome variables such as cognition (ES = 0.42, CI = 0.24, 0.60) and physical fitness (ES = 0.41, CI = 0.16, 0.65).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      VR interventions, particularly of the semi-immersive type, are useful for people with MCI or dementia.

            "abstract": "Network activity is strongly tied to animal movement; however, hippocampal circuits selectively engaged during locomotion or immobility remain poorly characterized. Here we examined whether distinct locomotor states are encoded differentially in genetically defined classes of hippocampal interneurons. To characterize the relationship between interneuron activity and movement, we used in vivo, two-photon calcium imaging in CA1 of male and female mice, as animals performed a virtual-reality (VR) track running task. We found that activity in most somatostatin-expressing and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons positively correlated with locomotion. Surprisingly, nearly one in five somatostatin or one in seven parvalbumin interneurons were inhibited during locomotion and activated during periods of immobility. Anatomically, the somata of somatostatin immobility-activated neurons were smaller than those of movement-activated neurons. Furthermore, immobility-activated interneurons were distributed across cell layers, with somatostatin-expressing cells predominantly in stratum oriens and parvalbumin-expressing cells mostly in stratum pyramidale. Importantly, each cell's correlation between activity and movement was stable both over time and across VR environments. Our findings suggest that hippocampal interneuronal microcircuits are preferentially active during either movement or immobility periods. These inhibitory networks may regulate information flow in \"labeled lines\" within the hippocampus to process information during distinct behavioral states.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The hippocampus is required for learning and memory. Movement controls network activity in the hippocampus but it's unclear how hippocampal neurons encode movement state. We investigated neural circuits active during locomotion and immobility and found interneurons were selectively active during movement or stopped periods, but not both. Each cell's response to locomotion was consistent across time and environments, suggesting there are separate dedicated circuits for processing information during locomotion and immobility. Understanding how the hippocampus switches between different network configurations may lead to therapeutic approaches to hippocampal-dependent dysfunctions, such as Alzheimer's disease or cognitive decline."

The intervention consisted of viewing 20-min of immersive 360° VR using a head-mounted display. Baseline and outcomes data were collected from the hospital electronic medical records, pre/post mood-state questionnaires, Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score, and standardized qualitative observations. Comprehensive process data and workflow were documented, including timestamps for each study task and detailed notes on personnel requirements and challenges encountered.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 516 patients admitted during the study, 67 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Nearly half (45.6%) of SDMs declined participation, and 40% could not be reached in time before patients being discharged, resulting in 57 eligible patients not being enrolled. Ten consented participants were enrolled and completed the study. The initial VR session averaged 53.6 min, largely due to the administration of NPI (mean = 19.5 min). Only four participants were able to respond reliably to questions. Seven participants opted for additional VR therapy sessions; of those providing feedback regarding the VR content, they wanted more varied scenery (animals, fields of flowers, holiday themes).

This review will focus on the current knowledge on circulating serum and plasma biomarkers of cognitive decline and dementia that are linked to cholesterol homeostasis and lipoprotein abnormalities, senile plaque formation and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammatory reactions. Special emphasis will, however, be placed on biomarkers related to lipoprotein metabolism and vascular disease. Analytically, most plasma and serum proteins or metabolites lack reproducibility, sensitivity, or specificity for the diagnosis, risk and progression assessment, or therapeutic monitoring of AD and other dementing disorders. Measures linked to lipoprotein metabolism and vascular disease, APP metabolism, oxidative stress, or inflammation appear altered in AD relative to controls, but lack sufficient discriminatory power. Measures combining several biomarkers or incorporating a range of proteins in plasma and small molecule metabolites are promising approaches for the development of plasma or serum-based diagnostic tests for AD and other dementing disorders, as well as for predementia syndromes."

This evidence is complicated by the uncertain impact of overexpressing mutant APP, rather than Aβ alone, and for potential interactions between tau and overexpressed APP. Cortical iron elevation is also implicated in AD, and tau promotes iron export by trafficking APP to the neuronal surface. Here, we utilized an alternative model of Aβ toxicity by directly injecting Aβ oligomers into the hippocampus of young and old wild-type and tau knockout mice. We found that ablation of tau protected against Aβ-induced cognitive impairment, hippocampal neuron loss, and iron accumulation. Despite injected human Aβ being eliminated after 5 weeks, enduring changes, including increased APP levels, tau reduction, tau phosphorylation, and iron accumulation, were observed. While the results from our study support the amyloid cascade hypothesis, they also suggest that downstream effectors of Aβ, which propagate toxicity after Aβ has been cleared, may be tractable therapeutic targets."

Her verbal memory and her recognition memory for unknown buildings, landmarks and outdoor scenes was intact, although she showed an impairment in face processing. By contrast, her navigational ability, quantitatively assessed within a small virtual reality (VR) town, was significantly impaired. Interestingly, she showed a selective impairment in a VR object-location memory test whenever her viewpoint was shifted between presentation and test, but not when tested from the same viewpoint. We suggest that a specific impairment in locating objects relative to the environment rather than relative to the perceived viewpoint (i.e. allocentric rather than egocentric spatial memory) underlies her topographical disorientation. We discuss the likely neural bases of this deficit in the light of related studies in humans and animals, focusing on the hippocampus and related areas. The specificity of our test indicates a new way of assessing topographical disorientation, with possible application to the assessment of progressive dementias such as Alzheimer's disease."

Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is believed to be safe and can be inexpensive, but neither its efficacy in enhancing cognitive performance in healthy older adults nor the impact of design factors on such efficacy has been systematically analyzed. Our aim therefore was to quantitatively assess whether CCT programs can enhance cognition in healthy older adults, discriminate responsive from nonresponsive cognitive domains, and identify the most salient design factors.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO for relevant studies from the databases' inception to 9 July 2014. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of ≥ 4 h of CCT on performance in neuropsychological tests in older adults without dementia or other cognitive impairment. Fifty-two studies encompassing 4,885 participants were eligible. Intervention designs varied considerably, but after removal of one outlier, heterogeneity across studies was small (I(2) = 29.92%). There was no systematic evidence of publication bias. The overall effect size (Hedges' g, random effects model) for CCT versus control was small and statistically significant, g = 0.22 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.29). Small to moderate effect sizes were found for nonverbal memory, g = 0.24 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.38); verbal memory, g = 0.08 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.15); working memory (WM), g = 0.22 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.35); processing speed, g = 0.31 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.50); and visuospatial skills, g = 0.30 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.54). No significant effects were found for executive functions and attention. Moderator analyses revealed that home-based administration was ineffective compared to group-based training, and that more than three training sessions per week was ineffective versus three or fewer. There was no evidence for the effectiveness of WM training, and only weak evidence for sessions less than 30 min. These results are limited to healthy older adults, and do not address the durability of training effects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      CCT is modestly effective at improving cognitive performance in healthy older adults, but efficacy varies across cognitive domains and is largely determined by design choices.

Here, we compared AD and aMCI patients with Normal Controls (NC) on the Ego-Allo- Switching spatial memory task. The task assessed the capacity to use switching (Ego-Allo, Allo-Ego) and non-switching (Ego-Ego, Allo-Allo) verbal judgments about relative distances between memorized stimuli.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The novel finding of this study is the neat impairment shown by aMCI and AD in switching from allocentric to egocentric reference frames. Interestingly, in aMCI when the first reference frame was egocentric, the allocentric deficit appeared attenuated.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This led us to conclude that allocentric deficits are not always clinically detectable in aMCI since the impairments could be masked when the first reference frame was body-centred. Alongside, AD and aMCI also revealed allocentric deficits in the non-switching condition. These findings suggest that switching alterations would emerge from impairments in hippocampal and posteromedial areas and from concurrent dysregulations in the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system or pre-frontal cortex."

The current systematic review aims to identify digital cognitive biomarkers from computerized tests for detecting dementia and its risk state of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of digital cognitive biomarkers. A literature search was performed in three databases, and supplemented by a Google search for names of previously identified computerized tests. Computerized tests were categorized into five types, including memory tests, test batteries, other single/multiple cognitive tests, handwriting/drawing tests, and daily living tasks and serious games. Results showed that 78 studies were eligible. Around 90% of the included studies were rated as high quality based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Most of the digital cognitive biomarkers achieved comparable or even better diagnostic performance than traditional paper-and-pencil tests. Moderate to large group differences were consistently observed in cognitive outcomes related to memory and executive functions, as well as some novel outcomes measured by handwriting/drawing tests, daily living tasks, and serious games. These outcomes have the potential to be sensitive digital cognitive biomarkers for MCI and dementia. Therefore, digital cognitive biomarkers can be a sensitive and promising clinical tool for detecting MCI and dementia."

Assessments consisted of cross-modal paired-associate learning, with subsequent tests of recognition and free recall following delays ranging from one to 13 days.Results: Retention intervals of at least three days were needed to evidence significant forgetting at both recognition and paired-associate recall test. The association between Gallery Game outcomes and established in-clinic memory assessments were small but numerically in the anticipated direction. In addition, there was preliminary support for utilizing the perirhinal-dependent pattern of semantic false alarms during object recognition as a marker of early impairment.Conclusions: These results support the need for tests of longer-term memory to sensitively record behavioral differences in adults with no diagnosis of cognitive impairment. Aggregate behavioral outcomes promote Gallery Game's utility as a digital assessment of episodic memory, aligning with established theoretical models of object memory and showing small yet uniform associations with existing in-clinic tests. Initial support for the discriminatory value of perirhinal-targeted outcomes justifies ongoing large-sample validation against traditional biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease."

            "abstract": "Cognitive impairment and dementia are major neurocognitive disorders that cause a noticeable decline in cognitive abilities, including memory and thinking skills. The effectiveness of using folic acid as an adjuvant for management of neurocognitive disorders is not well-known. This paper explains the role of folic acid, including its usefulness, effectiveness, adverse side effects, and active mechanisms on cognitive functions of the elderly. In the current study, we reviewed clinical and experimental studies investigating the use of folic acid prior to November 2017, using PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Science Direct, Scopus, Ovid, and Cochrane Library databases. A total of 142 articles were retrieved by electronic search. Based on the preset inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 36 articles were retrieved for full text analysis. According to data obtained from the review, it seems that folic acid supplementation may improve cognitive function by decreasing homocysteine (Hcy), vascular care, attenuating inflammatory status, modification of cerebral folic acid deficiency, and antioxidant responses. Specifically, people with high levels of Hcy have a better response to folic acid supplementation, which may arise from low serum folate concentration."

Using an identical training protocol, the VRADA system was first tested with a group of 30 university students (16 females; mean age 20.86, SD 1.17 years) and then with 27 older people (19 females; mean age 73.22, SD 9.26 years) who had been diagnosed with MCI (feasibility studies VR2a and VR2b). Those in the latter group attended two Hellenic Association Day Care Centers for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders. Participants in both groups were asked to perform a dual task training protocol that combined physical and cognitive exercises in two different training conditions. In condition A, participants performed a cycling task in a lab environment while being asked by the researcher to perform oral math calculations (single-digit additions and subtractions). In condition B, participants performed a cycling task in the virtual environment while performing calculations that appeared within the VR app. Participants in both groups were assessed in the same way; this included questionnaires and semistructured interviews immediately after the experiment to capture perceptions of acceptability, usability, and tolerability, and to determine which of the two training conditions each participant preferred.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participants in both groups showed a significant preference for the VR condition (students: mean 0.66, SD 0.41, t29=8.74, P<.001; patients with MCI: mean 0.72, SD 0.51, t26=7.36, P<.001), as well as high acceptance scores for intended future use, attitude toward VR training, and enjoyment.

First, patients typically express cognitive deficits in several domains. Therapies focusing on specific cognitive deficits might not address their interrelated neurological nature. Second, co-occurring psychological problems are often neglected or not diagnosed, although post-stroke depression is common and related to cognitive deficits. This pilot trial aims to test a rehabilitation program in virtual reality that trains various cognitive domains in conjunction, by adapting to the patient's disability and while investigating the influence of comorbidities.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty community-dwelling stroke patients at the chronic stage and suffering from cognitive impairment performed 30 min of daily training for 6 weeks.

To conduct a secondary analysis of the V-TIME study, a randomized, controlled investigation showing a greater reduction of falls after virtual reality treadmill training (TT + VR) compared with usual treadmill walking (TT) in a mixed population of fallers. We addressed whether these treadmill interventions led to similar gains in FOG+ as in FOG-. Methods. A total of 77 FOG+ and 44 FOG- were assigned randomly to TT + VR or TT. Participants were assessed pre- and posttraining and at 6 months' follow-up. Main outcome was postural stability assessed by the Mini Balance Evaluation System Test (Mini-BEST) test. Falls were documented using diaries. Other outcomes included the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOG-Q) and the Trail Making Test (TMT-B). Results. Mini-BEST scores and the TMT-B improved in both groups after training (P = .001), irrespective of study arm and FOG subgroup. However, gains were not retained at 6 months. Both FOG+ and FOG- had a greater reduction of falls after TT + VR compared with TT (P = .008). NFOG-Q scores did not change after both training modes in the FOG+ group. Conclusions. Treadmill walking (with or without VR) improved postural instability in both FOG+ and FOG-, while controlling for disease severity differences. As found previously, TT + VR reduced falls more than TT alone, even among those with FOG. Interestingly, FOG itself was not helped by training, suggesting that although postural instability, falls and FOG are related, they may be controlled by different mechanisms."

The main objective of this study was to compare the performances of PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) with PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and a control group (CG) using a traditional assessment of EFs and the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET), a virtual reality (VR)-based tool. In order to understand which subcomponents of EFs are early impaired, this experimental study aimed to investigate specifically which instrument best discriminates among these three groups.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      The study included three groups of 15 individuals each (for a total of 45 participants): 15 PD-NC; 15 PD-MCI, and 15 cognitively healthy individuals (CG). To assess the global neuropsychological functioning and the EFs, several tests (including the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clock Drawing Test, and Tower of London test) were administered to the participants.

The present study aimed for the first time at examining the role of semantic memory loss in PM and EFT in a single case patient (SL) at the early stage of semantic dementia.First, we investigated various types of PM as well as episodic memory of new events using a validated ecological assessment via virtual reality. Second, we examined EFT using a temporally extended version of the TEMPau task, which measures episodic aspects of remembering the past and imagining the future taking temporal distance into account.Patient SL was deficient in semantically linked event-based PM and was unable to provide any EFT for the most distant period but was preserved in other types of PM and near and intermediate EFT.These findings provide new evidence on the role of semantic memory in PM depending on the type of intention and in EFT depending on the temporal distance mirroring autobiographical memory. Finally, they point out a specific link between PM and near EFT in future-oriented cognition."

Compared with controls, aMCI patients showed reduced activity in the hippocampus bilaterally, retrosplenial cortex, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Reduced activation in key areas for successful navigation, as well as additional regions, was found alongside relatively normal task performance.

However, evidence for the benefit of sleep for EM consolidation in aging is still elusive. In addition, most of the previous studies used EM assessments that are very different from everyday life conditions and are far from considering all the hallmarks of this memory system. In this study, the effect of an extended period of sleep was compared to the effect of an extended period of active wakefulness on the EM consolidation of naturalistic events, using a novel (What-Where-When) EM task, rich in perceptual details and spatio-temporal context, presented in a virtual environment. We investigated the long-term What-Where-When and Details binding performances of young and elderly people before and after an interval of sleep or active wakefulness. Although we found a noticeable age-related decline in EM, both age groups benefited from sleep, but not from active wakefulness. In younger adults, only the period of sleep significantly enhanced the capacity to associate different components of EM (binding performance) and more specifically the free recall of what-when information. Interestingly, in the elderly, sleep significantly enhanced not only the recall of factual elements but also associated details and contextual information as well as the amount of high feature binding (i.e., What-Where-When and Details). Thus, this study evidences the benefit of sleep, and the detrimental effect of active wakefulness, on long-term feature binding, which is one of the core characteristics of EM, and its effectiveness in normal aging. However, further research should investigate whether this benefit is specific to sleep or more generally results from the effect of a post-learning period of reduced interference, which could also concern quiet wakefulness."

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive loss of cognitive functions like thinking, memory, reasoning, behavioral abilities, and social skills thus affecting the ability of a person to perform normal daily functions independently. There is no definitive cure for this disease, and treatment options available for the management of the disease are not very effective as well. Based on histopathology, AD is characterized by the accumulation of insoluble deposits of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Although several molecular events contribute to the formation of these insoluble deposits, the aberrant post-translational modifications (PTMs) of AD-related proteins (like APP, Aβ, tau, and BACE1) are also known to be involved in the onset and progression of this disease. However, early diagnosis of the disease as well as the development of effective therapeutic approaches is impeded by lack of proper clinical biomarkers. In this review, we summarized the current status and clinical relevance of biomarkers from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood and extracellular vesicles involved in onset and progression of AD. Moreover, we highlight the effects of several PTMs on the AD-related proteins, and provide an insight how these modifications impact the structure and function of proteins leading to AD pathology. Finally, for disease-modifying therapeutics, novel approaches, and targets are discussed for the successful treatment and management of AD."

            "abstract": "Understanding and diagnosing cognitive impairment in epilepsy remains a prominent challenge. New etiological models suggest that cognitive difficulties might not be directly linked to seizure activity, but are rather a manifestation of a broader brain pathology. Consequently, treating seizures is not sufficient to alleviate cognitive symptoms, highlighting the need for novel diagnostic tools. Here, we investigated whether the organization of three intrinsic, resting-state functional connectivity networks was correlated with domain-specific cognitive test performance. Using individualized EEG source reconstruction and graph theory, we examined the association between network small worldness and cognitive test performance in 23 patients with focal epilepsy and 17 healthy controls, who underwent a series of standardized pencil-and-paper and digital cognitive tests. We observed that the specific networks robustly correlated with test performance in distinct cognitive domains. Specifically, correlations were evident between the default mode network and memory in patients, the central-executive network and executive functioning in controls, and the salience network and social cognition in both groups. Interestingly, the correlations were evident in both groups, but in different domains, suggesting an alteration in these functional neurocognitive networks in focal epilepsy. The present findings highlight the potential clinical relevance of functional brain network dysfunction in cognitive impairment."

            "abstract": "Prospective memory (PM) refers to a complex cognitive ability that underpins the delayed execution of previously formulated intentions. PM performance declines early in normal aging and this process is accentuated in Alzheimer's disease. The left frontopolar cortex (BA10) has been consistently assigned a major role in PM functioning, but whether it can be noninvasively modulated to enhance PM performance in aged people has not been addressed so far. Here, we investigated the effects of modulating left BA10 by means of theta burst stimulation (TBS), using either excitatory (intermittent TBS), inhibitory (continuous TBS) or control (vertex) TBS in healthy aged subjects. The behavioral effects were assessed using a reliable and ecological virtual reality PM task that included both event- and time-based retrievals. As compared with vertex stimulation, event-based PM performance significantly improved after excitatory stimulation, whereas inhibitory stimulation had no significant effect. Additionally, and across the different types of stimulation, performance for congruent links between the event-based PM cue and the action to be performed was significantly better as compared with incongruent links. In conclusion, intermittent TBS might provide a relevant interventional strategy to counteract the decline of cognitive functions and memory abilities in normal aging."

Impairments in the cholinergic-mediated attentional supervision of gait may contribute to increased fall risk, especially when obstacles challenge gait. Interventions combining motor-cognitive approaches have been shown to improve motor performance, cognitive skills, and falls number. Here, we hypothesized that an intervention simulating an attention-demanding walking condition could affect not only complex gait performance and fall risk but also short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), as a marker of cholinergic activity.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-nine participants at falls risk (24 Parkinson's disease participants and 15 older adults) were recruited in a randomized controlled trial.

To make a symptom profile, users selected their most personally meaningful or troublesome dementia-related symptoms to track over time. Users were also asked to rank their chosen symptoms from least to most important, which we called the symptom potency. As the stage of disease for these web-based users was unknown, we applied a supervised staging algorithm, previously trained on clinician-derived data, to classify each profile into 1 of 4 stages: MCI and mild, moderate, and severe dementia. Across these stages, we compared symptom tracking frequency, symptom potency, and the relationship between frequency and potency.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Applying the staging algorithm to the 3909 user profiles resulted in 917 (23.46%) MCI, 1596 (40.83%) mild dementia, 514 (13.15%) moderate dementia, and 882 (22.56%) severe dementia profiles. We found that the most frequent symptoms in MCI and mild dementia profiles were similar and comprised early hallmarks of dementia (eg, recent memory and language difficulty). As the stage increased to moderate and severe, the most frequent symptoms were characteristic of loss of independent function (eg, incontinence) and behavioral problems (eg, aggression). The most potent symptoms were similar between stages and generally reflected disruptions in everyday life (eg, problems with hobbies or games, travel, and looking after grandchildren). Symptom frequency was negatively correlated with potency at all stages, and the strength of this relationship increased with increasing disease severity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our results emphasize the importance of patient-centricity in MCI and dementia studies and illustrate the valuable real-world evidence that can be collected with digital tools.

The use of the cholinergic immunotoxin 192IgG-saporin allows for the first time study of the impact of cortical cholinergic deafferentation on cortical neurotransmission, learning, and memory without direct effects on other neuronal systems. This model also allows the elucidation of contributions of cholinergic mechanisms to the establishment of other pathological features of Alzheimer's disease. The findings discussed here demonstrate that cholinergic immunolesions by 192IgG-saporin induce highly specific, permanent cortical cholinergic hypoactivity and alterations in cortical neurotransmitter densities comparable to those described for Alzheimer's disease. The induced cortical cholinergic deficit also leads to cortical/hippocampal neurotrophin accumulation and reduced amyloid precursor protein (APP) secretion, possibly reflecting the lack of stimulation of postsynaptic M1/M3 muscarinic receptors coupled to protein kinase C. This immunolesion model should prove useful to test therapeutic strategies based on stimulation of cortical cholinergic neurotransmission or amelioration of pathogenic aspects of cholinergic degeneration in the basal forebrain. Application of the model to animal species that can develop beta-amyloid plaques could provide information about the contribution of cholinergic function to amyloidogenic APP processing."

Its high prevalence in general population and the severe limitations it causes, point out the necessity to find new efficient strategies to treat it. Together with the cognitive-behavioural treatments, relaxation represents a useful approach for the treatment of GAD, but it has the limitation that it is hard to be learned. To overcome this limitation we propose the use of virtual reality (VR) to facilitate the relaxation process by visually presenting key relaxing images to the subjects. The visual presentation of a virtual calm scenario can facilitate patients' practice and mastery of relaxation, making the experience more vivid and real than the one that most subjects can create using their own imagination and memory, and triggering a broad empowerment process within the experience induced by a high sense of presence.

            "abstract": "Neuronal loss is the best neuropathological substrate that correlates with cortical atrophy and dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Defective GABAergic neuronal functions may lead to cortical network hyperactivity and aberrant neuronal oscillations and in consequence, generate a detrimental alteration in memory processes. In this study, using immunohistochemical and stereological approaches, we report that the two major and non-overlapping groups of inhibitory interneurons (SOM-cells and PV-cells) displayed distinct vulnerability in the perirhinal cortex of APP/PS1 mice and AD patients. SOM-positive neurons were notably sensitive and exhibited a dramatic decrease in the perirhinal cortex of 6-month-old transgenic mice (57% and 61% in areas 36 and 35, respectively) and, most importantly, in AD patients (91% in Braak V-VI cases). In addition, this interneuron degenerative process seems to occur in parallel, and closely related, with the progression of the amyloid pathology. However, the population expressing PV was unaffected in APP/PS1 mice while in AD brains suffered a pronounced and significant loss (69%). As a key component of cortico-hippocampal networks, the perirhinal cortex plays an important role in memory processes, especially in familiarity-based memory recognition. Therefore, disrupted functional connectivity of this cortical region, as a result of the early SOM and PV neurodegeneration, might contribute to the altered brain rhythms and cognitive failures observed in the initial clinical phase of AD patients. Finally, these findings highlight the failure of amyloidogenic AD models to fully recapitulate the selective neuronal degeneration occurring in humans."

The brain starts undergoing changes several years before the actual appearance of the symptoms. Nanotechnology could prove to be an alternative strategy for treating the disease effectively. It encompasses the diagnosis as well as the therapeutic aspect using validated biomarkers and nano-based drug delivery systems, respectively. A nano-based therapy may provide an alternate strategy, wherein one targets the protofibrillar amyloid-β (Aβ) structures, and this is followed by their disaggregation as random coils. Conventional/routine drug therapies are inefficient in crossing the blood-brain barrier; however, this hurdle can be overcome with the aid of nanoparticles. The present review highlights the various challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of AD. Meticulous and collaborative research using nanotherapeutic systems could provide remarkable breakthroughs in the early-stage diagnosis and therapy of AD."

Concurrently, the landscape of digital cognitive assessment is rapidly evolving as technology advances, older adult tech-adoption increases, and external events (i.e., COVID-19) necessitate remote digital assessment. Here, we provide a snapshot review of the current state of digital cognitive assessment for preclinical AD including different device platforms/assessment approaches, levels of validation, and implementation challenges. We focus on articles, grants, and recent conference proceedings specifically querying the relationship between digital cognitive assessments and established biomarkers for preclinical AD (e.g., amyloid beta and tau) in clinically normal (CN) individuals. Several digital assessments were identified across platforms (e.g., digital pens, smartphones). Digital assessments varied by intended setting (e.g., remote vs. in-clinic), level of supervision (e.g., self vs. supervised), and device origin (personal vs. study-provided). At least 11 publications characterize digital cognitive assessment against AD biomarkers among CN. First available data demonstrate promising validity of this approach against both conventional assessment methods (moderate to large effect sizes) and relevant biomarkers (predominantly weak to moderate effect sizes). We discuss levels of validation and issues relating to usability, data quality, data protection, and attrition. While still in its infancy, digital cognitive assessment, especially when administered remotely, will undoubtedly play a major future role in screening for and tracking preclinical AD."

The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease relies on tests to evaluate cognition and discriminate between individuals with dementia and those without dementia. The Mini-Cog is a brief, cognitive screening test that is frequently used to evaluate cognition in older adults in various settings.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The primary objective of this review was to determine the accuracy of the Mini-Cog for detecting dementia in a community setting. Secondary objectives included investigations of the heterogeneity of test accuracy in the included studies and potential sources of heterogeneity. These potential sources of heterogeneity included the baseline prevalence of dementia in study samples, thresholds used to determine positive test results, the type of dementia (Alzheimer's disease dementia or all causes of dementia), and aspects of study design related to study quality. Overall, the goals of this review were to determine if the Mini-Cog is a cognitive screening test that could be recommended to screen for cognitive impairment in community settings.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), Science Citation Index (Web of Science), BIOSIS previews (Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), and the Cochrane Dementia Group's developing register of diagnostic test accuracy studies to March 2013. We used citation tracking (using the database's 'related articles' feature, where available) as an additional search method and contacted authors of eligible studies for unpublished data.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included all cross-sectional studies that utilized the Mini-Cog as an index test for the diagnosis of dementia when compared to a reference standard diagnosis of dementia using standardized dementia diagnostic criteria. For the current review we only included studies that were conducted on samples from community settings, and excluded studies that were conducted in primary care or secondary care settings. We considered studies to be conducted in a community setting where participants were sampled from the general population.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Information from studies meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted including information on the characteristics of participants in the studies. The quality of the studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 criteria and summarized using risk of bias applicability and summary graphs. We extracted information on the diagnostic test accuracy of studies including the sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence intervals of these measures and summarized the findings using forest plots. Study specific sensitivities and specificities were also plotted in receiver operating curve space.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Three studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 1620 participants. The sensitivities of the Mini-Cog in the individual studies were reported as 0.99, 0.76 and 0.99. The specificity of the Mini-Cog varied in the individual studies and was 0.93, 0.89 and 0.83. There was clinical and methodological heterogeneity between the studies which precluded a pooled meta-analysis of the results. Methodological limitations were present in all the studies introducing potential sources of bias, specifically with respect to the methods for participant selection.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There are currently few studies assessing the diagnostic test accuracy of the Mini-Cog in community settings. The limited number of studies and the methodological limitations that are present in the current studies make it difficult to provide recommendations for or against the use of the Mini-Cog as a cognitive screening test in community settings. Additional well-designed studies comparing the Mini-Cog to other brief cognitive screening tests are required in order to determine the accuracy and utility of the Mini-Cog in community based settings."

This study explored the feasibility of completely unsupervised digital cognitive assessments using three novel memory tasks in a Citizen Science project across Germany. To that end, the study aimed to identify factors associated with stronger participant retention, to examine test-retest reliability and the extent of practice effects, as well as to investigate the influence of uncontrolled settings such as time of day, delay between sessions or screen size on memory performance. A total of 1,407 adults (aged 18-89) participated in the study for up to 12 weeks, completing weekly memory tasks in addition to short questionnaires regarding sleep duration, subjective cognitive complaints as well as cold symptoms. Participation across memory tasks was pseudorandomized such that individuals were assigned to one of three memory paradigms resulting in three otherwise identical sub-studies. One hundred thirty-eight participants contributed to two of the three paradigms. Critically, for each memory task 12 independent parallel test sets were used to minimize effects of repeated testing. First, we observed a mean participant retention time of 44 days, or 4 active test sessions, and 77.5% compliance to the study protocol in an unsupervised setting with no contact between participants and study personnel, payment or feedback. We identified subject-level factors that contributed to higher retention times. Second, we found minor practice effects associated with repeated cognitive testing, and reveal evidence for acceptable-to-good retest reliability of mobile testing. Third, we show that memory performance assessed through repeated digital assessments was strongly associated with age in all paradigms, and individuals with subjectively reported cognitive decline presented lower mnemonic discrimination accuracy compared to non-complaining participants. Finally, we identified design-related factors that need to be incorporated in future studies such as the time delay between test sessions. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of fully unsupervised digital remote memory assessments and identify critical factors to account for in future studies."

In line with this framework, patients with primary insomnia often report subjective memory impairment. However, investigations of memory performance did not produce conclusive results. The aim of this study was to further investigate memory performance in patients with primary insomnia in comparison to healthy controls, using two well-characterized learning tasks, a declarative virtual water maze task and emotional fear conditioning. Twenty patients with primary insomnia according to DSM-IV criteria (17 females, three males, 43.5 ± 13.0 years) and 20 good sleeper controls (17 females, three males, 41.7 ± 12.8 years) were investigated in a parallel-group study. All participants completed a hippocampus-dependent virtual Morris water maze task and amygdala-dependent classical fear conditioning. Patients with insomnia showed significantly delayed memory acquisition in the virtual water maze task, but no significant difference in fear acquisition compared with controls. These findings are consistent with the notion that memory processes that emerge from synaptic refinements in a hippocampal-neocortical network are particularly sensitive to chronic disruptions of sleep, while those in a basic emotional amygdala-dependent network may be more resilient."

            "abstract": "β-Amyloid (Aβ) accumulation in the brain is widely accepted to be critical to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current efforts at reducing toxic Aβ40 or 42 have largely focused on modulating γ-secretase activity to produce shorter, less toxic Aβ, while attempting to spare other secretase functions. In this paper we provide data that offer the potential for a new approach for the treatment of AD. The method is based on our previous findings that the production of Aβ from the interaction between the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Presenilin (PS), as part of the γ-secretase complex, in cell culture is largely inhibited if the entire water-soluble NH2-terminal domain of PS is first added to the culture. Here we demonstrate that two small, non-overlapping water-soluble peptides from the PS-1 NH2-terminal domain can substantially and specifically inhibit the production of total Aβ as well as Aβ40 and 42 in vitro and in vivo in the brains of APP transgenic mice. These results suggest that the inhibitory activity of the entire amino terminal domain of PS-1 on Aβ production is largely focused in a few smaller sequences within that domain. Using biolayer interferometry and confocal microscopy we provide evidence that peptides effective in reducing Aβ give a strong, specific and biologically relevant binding with the purified ectodomain of APP 695. Finally, we demonstrate that the reduction of Aβ by the peptides does not affect the catalytic activities of β- or γ-secretase, or the level of APP. P4 and P8 are the first reported protein site-specific small peptides to reduce Aβ production in model systems of AD. These peptides and their derivatives offer new potential drug candidates for the treatment of AD."

The most common dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a disorder in which exercise induces significant improvement at pathophysiopathological and cognitive levels. In the present work, we studied the relationship between physical exercise, oxidative stress, and cognition in the double transgenic mice model (2×Tg) for AD, APP/PSN1. This model is mainly based on the cerebral deposition of amyloid β plaques.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      Eighteen ten-month-old mice were divided into four experimental groups: exercised 2×Tg (2×Tg-E) (n=5), rested 2×Tg (2×Tg-R) (n=5), exercised controls (control-E) (n=4) and rested controls (control-R) (n=4). We trained the animals for twelve weeks with a combination of forced exercise (treadmill running three days/week) and spontaneous wheel running. The animals were evaluated with physical and cognitive tests before and after the training period. We analyzed systemic and cortical oxidative damage and the induction of antioxidant enzymes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The 2×Tg-R mice showed a decrease in their grip strength and VO(2max) as they grew older which was prevented by training. The 2×Tg-E group showed better memory than the 2×Tg-R animals. All the trained groups demonstrated greater exploratory capacity and less anxiety than the sedentary animals. Systemic oxidative damage was slightly decreased in the 2×Tg, although we found no difference in the lipoperoxidation and in the induction of the antioxidant defense in cortex between groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Physical exercise leads to improvements in the grip strength, VO(2max), cognition, and memory in 2×Tg mice. These improvements are not significantly related to changes in the antioxidant defenses or a reduction in the oxidative damage brought about by exercise."

            "abstract": "Analyzing the effects landmarks have on spatial learning is an active area of research in the study of human navigation processes and one that is key to understanding the links between human brain dynamics, landmark encoding, and spatial learning outcomes. This article presents a study on whether electroencephalography (EEG) signals related to virtual global landmarks combined with deep learning can be used to predict the accuracy and efficacy of spatial learning. Virtual global landmarks are silhouettes of actual landmarks projected into the navigator's vision via a heads-up display. They serve as a notable frame of reference in addition to the local landmarks we all typically use for route navigation. From a mobile virtual reality scenario involving 55 participants, the results of the study suggest that the EEG data associated with those who were exposed to global landmarks shows a visibly better capacity for predicting the quality of spatial learning levels than those who were not. As such, the EEG features associated with processing VGLs have a greater functional relation to the quality of spatial learning. This finding opens up a future direction of enquiry into landmark encoding and navigational ability. It may also provide a potential avenue for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease."

Its application to detect visual impairments during normal aging and over the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is evaluated in wild-type (WT) and transgenic APPSWE/PS1∆E9 murine models of AD (AD+) across an array of irradiance, chromaticity, and contrast conditions. Substantial color and contrast-mode alternation deficits appear in AD+ mice at an age when hippocampal-based memory and learning is still intact. Profiling of timespan, entries and transition patterns between the different arms uncovers variable AD-associated impairments in contrast sensitivity and color discrimination, reminiscent of tritanomalous defects documented in AD patients. Transition deficits are found in aged WT mice in the absence of alternation decline. Overall, ViS4M is a versatile, controlled device to measure color and contrast-related vision in aged and diseased mice."

We recently developed the Ubiquitous Spaced Retrieval-based Memory Advancement and Rehabilitation Training (USMART) program as a convenient, self-administered tablet-based SRT program. We also demonstrated the utility of USMART for improving memory in individuals with MCI through an open-label uncontrolled trial.\n## METHODS\nThis study had an open-label, single-blind, randomized, controlled, two-period crossover design. Fifty patients with MCI were randomized into USMART-usual care and usual care-USMART treatment sequences. USMART was completed or usual care was provided biweekly over a 4-week treatment period with a 2-week washout period between treatment periods. Primary outcome measures included the Word List Memory Test, Word List Recall Test (WLRT), and Word List Recognition Test. Outcomes were measured at baseline, week 5, and week 11 by raters who were blinded to intervention type. An intention-to-treat analysis and linear mixed modeling were used.\n## RESULTS\nOf 50 randomized participants, 41 completed the study (18% dropout rate). The USMART group had larger improvements in WLRT score (effect size = 0.49, p = 0.031) than the usual care group. There were no significant differences in other primary or secondary measures between the USMART and usual care groups. Moreover, no USMART-related adverse events were reported.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe 4-week USMART modestly improved information retrieval in older people with MCI, and was well accepted with minimal technical support.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT01688128 .

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease causing progressive impairment of memory and cognitive function. The amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that mismetabolism of the beta-amyloid (A beta) precursor protein (APP) followed by subsequent formation of non-fibrillar and fibrillar A beta deposits leads to glial activation and eventually to neurotoxicity, causing cognitive impairment. Several lines of evidence indicate that an inflammatory process contributes to the pathology of AD. First, inflammatory proteins have been identified as being associated with neuritic plaques and in glial cells surrounding these plaques. Second, certain polymorphisms of acute-phase proteins and cytokines associated with AD plaques increase the risk or predispose for earlier onset of developing AD. Third, epidemiological studies indicate that anti-inflammatory drugs can retard the development of AD. Several steps in the pathological cascade of AD have been identified as possible targets for actions of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. For instance, microglia are considered a target because this cell type is closely involved in AD pathology through secretion of neurotoxic substances and by modulating a positive feedback loop of the inflammatory mechanism that may be involved in the pathological cascade in AD. On the basis of studies in APP transgenic mice, immunisation with A beta was recently suggested as a novel immunological approach for the treatment of AD. Immunisation elicits A beta-specific antibodies that could affect several early steps of the amyloid-driven cascade. Antibodies could prevent A beta from aggregating into fibrils and accelerate clearance of A beta by stimulating its removal by microglial cells. This review outlines the pathological and genetic evidence that an inflammatory mechanism is involved in AD and the therapeutic approaches based on inhibition or mediation of inflammation."

            "abstract": "A viewpoint considering Alzheimer's disease (AD) as \"type 3 diabetes\" emphasizes the pivotal role of dysfunctional brain energy metabolism in AD. The hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a crucial regulator in energy metabolism; however, our understanding of the therapeutic potential and mechanisms underlying the effect of FGF21 on neurodegeneration of AD is far from complete. Methods: To further elucidate the effect of FGF21 on AD-related neurodegeneration, we used APP/PS1 transgenic mice to assess the effects of FGF21 on memory dysfunction, amyloid plaque pathology and pathological tau hyperphosphorylation. We also established an in vitro system to mimic astrocyte-neuron communication and an in vivo model of acute injury. Based on the in vivo and in vitro models, we analyzed the neuroprotective actions of FGF21 and pathways related to astrocyte-neuron communication and further focused on the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle system. Results: Here, we report that FGF21 can ameliorate Alzheimer-like neurodegeneration in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. We detected defects in the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle system in the in vivo and in vitro models of AD and identified FGF21 as a neuroprotective molecule that can rescue these deficits. Administration of FGF21 can alleviate memory dysfunction, amyloid plaque pathology and pathological tau hyperphosphorylation, and the function of FGF21 in neurodegeneration is mediated in part by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). In vivo evidence also suggests that FGF21 acts centrally in mice to exert its effects on neurodegeneration and energy metabolism via its regulation of MCTs. Conclusions: These results suggest that FGF21 alters metabolic parameters to mediate its neuroprotective functions. Modulation of the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle system can be one of the most efficient strategies for FGF21 in Alzheimer-like degeneration and contributes to improvements in brain metabolic defects and amyloid β-induced cytotoxicity. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of FGF21 on neurodegeneration and brain energy metabolism and suggest that FGF21 may have therapeutic value in the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases."

Recently there has been an increase in the potential of diagnostic tools and pharmacological treatments for dementia; moreover, considerable interest has been expressed regarding non pharmacological interventions. However, the current evidence in support of non pharmacological treatments in patients affected by dementia still does not allow to draw definitive conclusions on what is the most effective treatment to apply, largely because of methodological difficulties and limitations of the studies so far carried out due to the complex nature of the disease. To address this need, we carried out a single blind randomized controlled study on the efficacy of computer cognitive rehabilitation in patients with mild cognitive decline. We here present preliminary data on 11 patients with diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and mild cognitive decline randomly assigned to treatment (a) or control (b) condition (i.e. specific vs. aspecific treatment). The specific treatment (a) consisted in a cycle of 12 individual sessions of computer exercises, while the control condition (b) consisted in sessions of semi-structured interviews with patients, conducted with the same frequency and time period as (a). Cognitive, behavioural and functional assessment was performed by an expert evaluator, blinded to the patients' group allocation. Preliminary results show a significant performance decline only in the control group at the 9-month follow-up compared to both baseline and the 3-month follow-up.

            "abstract": "Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is a therapeutic candidate for Alzheimer's disease, based on its well known actions on basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. However, because of its pro-nociceptive activity, in current clinical trials NGF has to be administered intraparenchymally into the brain by neurosurgery via cell or gene therapy approaches. To prevent the NGF pain-inducing collateral effects, thus avoiding the necessity for local brain injection, we developed painless NGF (hNGFp), based on the human genetic disease Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy type V (HSAN V). hNGFp has similar neurotrophic activity as wild type human NGF, but its pain sensitizing activity is tenfold lower. Pharmacologically, hNGFp is a biased receptor agonist of NGF TrkA receptor. The results of recent studies shed new light on the neuroprotective mechanism by hNGFp and are highly relevant for the planning of NGF-based clinical trials. The intraparenchymal delivery of hNGFp, as used in clinical trials, was simulated in the 5xFAD mouse model and found to be inefficacious in reducing Aβ plaque load. On the contrary, the same dose of hNGFp administered intranasally, which was rather widely biodistributed in the brain and did not induce pain sensitization, blocked APP processing into amyloid and restored synaptic plasticity and memory in this aggressive neurodegeneration model. This potent and broad neuroprotection by hNGFp was found to be mediated by hNGFp actions on glial cells. hNGFp increases inflammatory proteins such as the soluble TNFα receptor II and the chemokine CXCL12. Independent work has shown that NGF has a potent anti-inflammatory action on microglia and steers them towards a neuroprotective phenotype. These studies demonstrate that microglia cells are a new target cell of NGF in the brain and have therapeutic significance: i) they establish that the neuroprotective actions of hNGFp relies on a widespread exposure of the brain, ii) they identify a new anti-neurodegenerative pathway, linking hNGFp to inflammatory chemokines and cytokines via microglia, a common target for new therapeutic opportunities for neurodegenerative diseases, iii) they extend the neuroprotective potential of hNGFp beyond its classical cholinergic target, thereby widening the range of neurological diseases for which this neurotrophic factor might be used therapeutically, iv) they help interpreting the results of current NGF clinical trials in AD and the design of future trials with this new potent therapeutic candidate."

There is a great need to develop non-pharmacological therapeutic interventions likely to reduce dependency in everyday activities in AD patients. This study investigated whether it was possible to increase autonomy in these patients in cooking activities using interventions based on errorless learning, vanishing-cue, and virtual reality techniques. We recruited a 79-year-old woman who met NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. She was trained in four cooking tasks for four days per task, one hour per day, in virtual and in real conditions. Outcome measures included subjective data concerning the therapeutic intervention and the experience of virtual reality, repeated assessments of training activities, neuropsychological scores, and self-esteem and quality of life measures. The results indicated that our patient could relearn some cooking activities using virtual reality techniques. Transfer to real life was also observed. Improvement of the task performance remained stable over time. This case report supports the value of a non-immersive virtual kitchen to help people with AD to relearn cooking activities."

New technological solutions, including digital devices, application programs (apps), sensors and virtual reality, represent promising possibilities for objective and reliable assessment, monitoring and intervention strategies in this field. Our structured review presents an up-to-date summary of the technological solutions for the (i) diagnosis, (ii) management and (iii) treatment of AD-related symptoms. To this end, we searched electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) for studies published over the last 10 years. Two authors of the review extracted data of interest. A total of eight manuscripts were included. In the last decade, a series of technological solutions across AD stages have been proposed. These include: (i) innovative strategies for the early detection of deficits in finger dexterity, visuo-spatial abilities (including spatial navigation), divided attention and instrumental autonomy; (ii) tools to activate the patient's responsiveness in terms of alertness and mood improvement; and (iii) useful interventions for retrieving memories, increasing body movements and improving spatial cognition. Methodological limitations, mainly pertaining to the paucity of randomized controlled trials and comprehensive assessments, were observed. Advances in technology currently provide the potential for designing innovative methods for evaluating, controlling and handling AD-related symptoms. The co-creation of technological solutions with all stakeholders represents the best way to design effective strategies for PwAD."

            "abstract": "Metals-especially iron, copper and manganese-are important elements of brain functions and development. Metal-dysregulation homeostasis is associated with brain-structure damage to the motor, cognitive and emotional systems, and leads to neurodegenerative processes. There is more and more evidence that specialized cognitive and motor exercises can enhance brain function and attenuate neurodegeneration in mechanisms, such as improving neuroplasticity by altering the synaptic structure and function in many brain regions. Psychological and physical methods of rehabilitation are now becoming increasingly important, as pharmacological treatments for movement, cognitive and emotional symptoms are limited. The present study describes physical and cognitive rehabilitation methods of patients associated with metal-induced neurotoxicity such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease and Wilson's disease. In our review, we describe physical (e.g., virtual-reality environments, robotic-assists training) and psychological (cognitive training, cognitive stimulation, neuropsychological rehabilitation and cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness-based therapies) methods, significantly improving the quality of life and independence of patients associated with storage diseases. Storage diseases are a diverse group of hereditary metabolic defects characterized by the abnormal cumulation of storage material in cells. This topic is being addressed due to the fact that rehabilitation plays a vital role in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately so far there are no specific guidelines concerning physiotherapy in neurodegenerative disorders, especially in regards to duration of exercise, type of exercise and intensity, as well as frequency of exercise. This is in part due to the variety of symptoms of these diseases and the various levels of disease progression. This further proves the need for more research to be carried out on the role of exercise in neurodegenerative disorder treatment."

PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL were searched for research reports, and OpenGray was used for gray literature. Studies with data about the age at onset or diagnosis, age at death, and disease duration were included. Pooled estimates with corresponding 95% CIs were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. The variability in disease onset was compared with that of autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease. Based on these estimates, a hypothetical distribution of age at death was constructed, assuming fully penetrant Alzheimer disease. These results were compared with real-world mortality data.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In this meta-analysis, the estimate of age at onset was 53.8 years (95% CI, 53.1-54.5 years; n = 2695); the estimate of age at death, 58.4 years (95% CI, 57.2-59.7 years; n = 324); and the estimate of disease duration, 4.6 years (95% CI, 3.7-5.5 years; n = 226). Coefficients of variation and 95% prediction intervals of age at onset were comparable with those reported in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease. US mortality data revealed an increase in life expectancy in Down syndrome (median [IQR], 1 [0.3-16] years in 1968 to 57 [49-61] years in 2019), but with clear ceiling effects in the highest percentiles of age at death in the last decades (90th percentile: 1990, age 63 years; 2019, age 65 years). The mortality data matched the limits projected by a distribution assuming fully penetrant Alzheimer disease in up to 80% of deaths (corresponding to the highest percentiles). This contrasts with dementia mentioned in 30% of death certificates but is in agreement with the mortality data in DABNI (78.9%). Important racial disparities persisted in 2019, being more pronounced in the lower percentiles (10th percentile: Black individuals, 1 year; White individuals, 30 years) than in the higher percentiles (90th percentile: Black individuals, 64 years; White individuals, 66 years).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      These findings suggest that the mortality data and the consistent age at onset were compatible with fully penetrant Alzheimer disease.

            "abstract": "Establishing methods for ascertainment of dementia and cognitive impairment that are accurate and also cost-effective is a challenging enterprise. Large population-based studies often using administrative data sets offer relatively inexpensive and reliable estimates of severe conditions including moderate to advanced dementia that are useful for public health planning, but they can miss less severe cognitive impairment which may be the most effective point for intervention. Clinical and epidemiological cohorts, intensively assessed, provide more sensitive detection of less severe cognitive impairment but are often costly. In this article, several approaches to ascertainment are evaluated for validity, reliability, and cost. In particular, the methods of ascertainment from the Health and Retirement Study are described briefly, along with those of the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS). ADAMS, a resource-intense sub-study of the Health and Retirement Study, was designed to provide diagnostic accuracy among persons with more advanced dementia. A proposal to streamline future ADAMS assessments is offered. Also considered are algorithmic and Web-based approaches to diagnosis that can reduce the expense of clinical expertise and, in some contexts, can reduce the extent of data collection. These approaches are intended for intensively assessed epidemiological cohorts where goal is valid and reliable case detection with efficient and cost-effective tools."

Overall these results demonstrate the reliability and validity of the NCPT battery as a measure of cognitive performance and support the feasibility of web-based, unsupervised testing, with potential utility in clinical and research settings."

            "abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance:\n        \n      \n      The traditional Chinese medicine formula Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS) has been reported to show therapeutic effect on alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n    \n\n\n          Aim of the study:\n        \n      \n      The present study aims to investigate the relation between DSS treatment of AD and DHA metabolism and evaluates its neuroprotective effect on cognitive in APP/PS1 mice.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      DSS (1.6, 3.2, 6.4 g/kg/day) or Aricept (3 mg/kg/day) was orally administered (i.g.) to APP/PS1 mice, and saline was orally administered to Wild-type (WT) male mice as control group. Then, the Morris water maze (MWM) test, Y-maze spontaneous alternation test, open filed test and fear conditioning test were conducted for evaluation of learning and memory abilities. The DHA content was assessed by HPLC-MS/MS. Physiological indices were determined, including triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), ROS level, activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), PEG2, TXB2 and LTB4. The expressions of COX-1, COX-2, cPLA2, iPLA2, 15-LOX, and were assessed by Western blot.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      APP/PS1 mice showed serious cognitive impairment in behavioral tests. However, treatment of DSS extract significantly ameliorated the cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 mice. Biochemical measurements showed the increases in TG, TC, LDL-c and the decrease in HDL-c in APP/PS1 mice compared with WT mice, and DSS extract significantly retarded these changes. Low content of DHA, low expression of iPLA2 and 15-LOX were observed both in hippocampus and cortex of APP/PS1 mice, while DSS extract significantly restored these changes. Additionally, the abnormal activity of SOD and ROS level, the decreased levels of MDA and GSH were observed in APP/PS1 mice, while DSS extract prominently lessened these changes. Moreover, DSS extract decreased the level of PEG2, TXB2 and LTB4 and also attenuated the expression of cPLA2, COX-1 and COX-2 in hippocampus as well as cortex of APP/PS1 mice.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Based on these results, we suggest that DSS play a positive effective role in increasing DHA content by up-regulating iPLA2 and 15-LOX, resulting in ameliorating oxidative stress and inflammation and finally ameliorating cognition deficits in APP/PS1 mice."

            "abstract": "The process by which visual information is incorporated into the brain's spatial framework to represent landmarks is poorly understood. Studies in humans and rodents suggest that retrosplenial cortex (RSC) plays a key role in these computations. We developed an RSC-dependent behavioral task in which head-fixed mice learned the spatial relationship between visual landmark cues and hidden reward locations. Two-photon imaging revealed that these cues served as dominant reference points for most task-active neurons and anchored the spatial code in RSC. This encoding was more robust after task acquisition. Decoupling the virtual environment from mouse behavior degraded spatial representations and provided evidence that supralinear integration of visual and motor inputs contributes to landmark encoding. V1 axons recorded in RSC were less modulated by task engagement but showed surprisingly similar spatial tuning. Our data indicate that landmark representations in RSC are the result of local integration of visual, motor, and spatial information."

As a supplement and alternative medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) targets multiple pathways which may be different from classical Western medicine, which may be orchestrated with Western medicine to materialize multiplying efficacy in AD patients. Objective: To investigate the therapeutic effect and assess the available preclinical evidence and possible mechanisms of β-asarone which was extracted from Acorus gramineus Soland (Araceae, AGS) for AD based on rat and mouse animal models. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, BIOSIS Previews, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to 5 May 2022. Rat and mouse experiments assessing the therapeutic effects of β-asarone for AD were included. Primary outcomes were neuroethology, including escape latency and times of crossing platform. Second outcomes were cell apoptosis, including Bax and Bcl-2. The weighted mean difference (WMD) was generated for continuous variables. The relative outcomes were analyzed with the aid of Get Data Graph Digitizer 2.26 and software STATA version 16.0 MP. Results: For the primary endpoint, compared with the modeling group, β-asarone significantly decreased the escape latency (WMD = -12.61, 95% CI: -18.66 to -6.57) and increased the times of crossing platform (WMD = 1.50, 95% CI: 0.31-2.70). For the secondary endpoint, β-asarone remarkably reduced the relative expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (WMD = -2.25, 95% CI: -2.49 to -2.01), decreased the expression of the apoptosis-related protein, associated X protein (Bax) (WMD = -2.40, 95% CI: -3.51 to -1.29), lowered the expression of apoptosis-related protein, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) (WMD = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.38-0.46), and decreased the signal pathway-related proteins, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) (WMD = -0.70, 95% CI: -0.93 to -0.47) over the control group.

Twenty-one older adults in a senior living community and a family member (who participated in the VR with the older adult from a distance) engaged in a baseline telephone call, followed by three weekly VR sessions. The VR was associated with improvements in older adults' affect and stress, relationship with their family member, and overall quality of life, compared to baseline. Family members' negative affect, depressive symptoms, and caregiver burden also decreased and their mental health improved after using the VR, compared to baseline. Using the VR, however, did not change their relationship with the older adult. In addition, older adults and family members who experienced the VR sessions as more socially engaging reported better psychological and relational well-being, with older adults also experiencing greater improvements in overall quality of life. Finally, preliminary results suggest that older adults with dementia and their family members might benefit even more from using the VR than older adults with MCI and their family members."

Specifically, we identify transition periods between activities as times to issue prompts. We consider the problem of detecting activity transitions using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, and find that both techniques show promising results for detecting transition periods. We test the techniques in a scripted setting with 15 individuals. Motion sensors data is recorded and annotated as participants perform a fixed set of activities. We also test the techniques in an unscripted setting with 8 individuals. Motion sensor data is recorded as participants go about their normal daily routine. In both the scripted and unscripted settings a true positive rate of greater than 80% can be achieved while maintaining a false positive rate of less than 15%. On average, this leads to transitions being detected within 1 minute of a true transition for the scripted data and within 2 minutes of a true transition on the unscripted data."

Because of the significant ramifications of falls, many interventions have been proposed, but few have aimed to prevent falls via an integrated approach targeting both motor and cognitive function. We aimed to test the hypothesis that an intervention combining treadmill training with non-immersive virtual reality (VR) to target both cognitive aspects of safe ambulation and mobility would lead to fewer falls than would treadmill training alone.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We carried out this randomised controlled trial at five clinical centres across five countries (Belgium, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK). Adults aged 60-90 years with a high risk of falls based on a history of two or more falls in the 6 months before the study and with varied motor and cognitive deficits were randomly assigned by use of computer-based allocation to receive 6 weeks of either treadmill training plus VR or treadmill training alone. Randomisation was stratified by subgroups of patients (those with a history of idiopathic falls, those with mild cognitive impairment, and those with Parkinson's disease) and sex, with stratification per clinical site. Group allocation was done by a third party not involved in onsite study procedures. Both groups aimed to train three times per week for 6 weeks, with each session lasting about 45 min and structured training progression individualised to the participant's level of performance. The VR system consisted of a motion-capture camera and a computer-generated simulation projected on to a large screen, which was specifically designed to reduce fall risk in older adults by including real-life challenges such as obstacles, multiple pathways, and distracters that required continual adjustment of steps. The primary outcome was the incident rate of falls during the 6 months after the end of training, which was assessed in a modified intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who were assigned a treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01732653.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Between Jan 6, 2013, and April 3, 2015, 302 adults were randomly assigned to either the treadmill training plus VR group (n=154) or treadmill training alone group (n=148). Data from 282 (93%) participants were included in the prespecified, modified intention-to-treat analysis.

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Cognition generally declines gradually over time due to progressive degeneration of the brain, leading to dementia and eventual loss of independent functions. The rate of regression varies among the six cognitive domains (perceptual motor, executive function, complex attention, learning and memory, social cognition and language). Current modality of cognitive assessment using neuropsychological paper-and-pencil screening tools for cognitive impairment such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has limitations and is influenced by age. Virtual reality (VR) is considered as a potential alternative tool to assess cognition. A novel, fully immersive automated VR system (Cognitive Assessment using Virtual Reality, CAVIRE) has been developed to assess the six cognitive domains. As cognition is associated with age, VR performance is postulated to vary with age using this system.\n    \n\n\n          Aims:\n        \n      \n      This is a feasibility study to evaluate the VR performance of cognitively healthy adults aged between 35 and 74 years old, based on the performance score and completion time using the CAVIRE system.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Conducted in a public primary care clinic in Singapore, 25 multi-ethnic Asian adults were recruited in each of the four age groups in years: (1) 35-44; (2) 45-54; (3) 55-64, and (4) 65-74. The eligibility criteria included a MoCA score of 26 or higher to reflect normal cognition and understanding English instructions. They completed common daily activities ranging from brushing teething to shopping, across 13 VR segments. Their performances scores and completion time were automatically computed by the CAVIRE system. These VR performance indices were compared across the four age groups using one-way ANOVA, F-test of the hypothesis, followed by pair-wise comparisons in the event of a significant F-test (p < 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One participant dropped out from Group 1. The demographic characteristics of 99 participants were similar across the 4 age groups. Overall, younger participants in Groups 1 and 2 attained higher VR performance scores and shorter completion time, compared to those in Groups 3 and 4, in all six cognitive domains (all p < 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The CAVIRE VR performance scores and completion time significantly differ between the younger and older Asian participants with normal cognition.

Trial site functions, trial design, and patient recruitment for trials all require improvement. The Global Alzheimer Platform (GAP) was initiated in response to these challenges. Four GAP work streams evolved in the US to address different trial challenges: 1) registry-to-cohort web-based recruitment; 2) clinical trial site activation and site network construction (GAP-NET); 3) adaptive proof-of-concept clinical trial design; and 4) finance and fund raising. GAP-NET proposes to establish a standardized network of continuously funded trial sites that are highly qualified to perform trials (with established clinical, biomarker, imaging capability; certified raters; sophisticated management system. GAP-NET will conduct trials for academic and biopharma industry partners using standardized instrument versions and administration. Collaboration with the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) European Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (EPAD) program, the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) and other similar international initiatives will allow conduct of global trials. GAP-NET aims to increase trial efficiency and quality, decrease trial redundancy, accelerate cohort development and trial recruitment, and decrease trial costs. The value proposition for sites includes stable funding and uniform training and trial execution; the value to trial sponsors is decreased trial costs, reduced time to execute trials, and enhanced data quality. The value for patients and society is the more rapid availability of new treatments for AD."

This ability to suppress the activation of specific brain regions has, to our knowledge, never been systematically evaluated in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). The aim of the current study was to evaluate both cerebral activation and deactivation in (1) healthy volunteers, (2) patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at risk for AD, and (3) patients with moderate AD during active navigation, representing a cognitive task typically affected in AD.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were assessed with PET imaging during an active navigation task in a 3D virtual-reality environment. The task was based on visual cues exclusively; no auditory cues were provided. Age-matched groups of healthy individuals, patients with MCI, and patients with AD were examined. Specific differences in the activation patterns were observed in the three groups, with stronger activation of cerebellar portions and visual association cortex in controls and stronger activation of primary visual and frontal cortical areas in patients with MCI and AD. Highly significant bilateral decrease of rCBF in task-irrelevant auditory cortical regions was detected in healthy individuals during performance of the task. This rCBF decrease was interpreted as a cross-modal inhibitory effect. It was diminished in patients with MCI and completely absent in patients with AD. A regression analysis across all individuals revealed a clear positive relation between cognitive status (mini mental state examination score) and the extent of auditory cortical deactivation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      During active navigation, a high level of movement automation and an involvement of higher-order cerebral association functions were observed in healthy controls. Conversely, in patients with MCI and AD, increased cognitive effort and attention towards movement planning, as well as stronger involvement of lower-order cerebral systems, was found. Successful cognitive performance in healthy individuals is associated with deactivation of task-irrelevant cerebral regions, whereas the development of AD appears to be characterized by a progressive impairment of cross-modal cerebral deactivation functions. These changes may cause the generally decreased ability of patients with AD to direct attention primarily to the relevant cognitive modality."

Although damage to the human fornix also results in memory impairment, it is not known whether there is a preferential involvement of this white-matter tract in spatial learning, as implied by animal studies. Diffusion-weighted MR images were obtained from healthy participants who had completed versions of a task in which they made rapid same/different discriminations to two categories of highly visually similar stimuli: (1) virtual reality scene pairs; and (2) face pairs. Diffusion-MRI measures of white-matter microstructure [fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD)] and macrostructure (tissue volume fraction, f) were then extracted from the fornix of each participant, which had been reconstructed using a deterministic tractography protocol. Fornix MD and f measures correlated with scene, but not face, discrimination accuracy in both discrimination tasks. A complementary voxelwise analysis using tract-based spatial statistics suggested the crus of the fornix as a focus for this relationship. These findings extend previous reports of spatial learning impairments after fornix transection in nonhuman primates, critically highlighting the fornix as a source of interindividual variation in scene discrimination in humans."

The Malaysian herb Orthosiphon stamineus is a traditional remedy that possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and free-radical scavenging abilities, all of which are known to protect against AD. Previous studies have reported that intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of streptozotocin (STZ) mimics a condition similar to that observed in AD. This experiment thus aimed to explore if an ethanolic leaf extract of O. stamineus has the potential to be a novel treatment for AD in a rat model and can reverse the STZ- induced learning and memory dysfunction. The results of this study indicate that O. stamineus has the potential to be potentially effective against AD-like condition, as both behavioral models employed in this study was observed to be able to reverse memory impairment. Treatment with the extract was able to decrease the up-regulated expression levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT), Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFᴋB), glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha (GSK3α), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) genes indicating the extract's neuroprotective ability.

Although there is a strict regulation mechanism for iron homeostasis in the human body and brain, it is usually inevitably disturbed by genetic and environmental factors, or disordered with aging, which leads to iron metabolism diseases, including many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is one of the most common degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) threatening human health. However, the precise pathogenesis of AD is still unclear, which seriously restricts the design of interventions and treatment drugs based on the pathogenesis of AD. Many studies have observed abnormal iron accumulation in different regions of the AD brain, resulting in cognitive, memory, motor and other nerve damages. Understanding the metabolic balance mechanism of iron in the brain is crucial for the treatment of AD, which would provide new cures for the disease. This paper reviews the recent progress in the relationship between iron and AD from the aspects of iron absorption in intestinal cells, storage and regulation of iron in cells and organs, especially for the regulation of iron homeostasis in the human brain and prospects the future directions for AD treatments."

            "abstract": "Cognitive interventions in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) seek to ameliorate cognitive symptoms in the condition. Cognitive interventions may or may not generalize beyond cognitive outcomes to everyday life. This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to assess the effect of cognitive interventions compared to a control group in MCI on generalizability outcome measures [activities of daily living (ADLs), mood, quality of life (QOL), and metacognition] rather than cognitive outcomes alone. PRISMA guidelines were followed. MEDLINE and PsychInfo were utilized as data sources to locate references related to cognitive interventions in individuals with MCI. The cognitive intervention study was required to have a control or alternative treatment comparison group to be included. Thirty articles met criteria, including six computerized cognitive interventions, 14 therapist-based interventions, and 10 multimodal (i.e., cognitive intervention plus an additional intervention) studies. Small, but significant overall median effects were seen for ADLs (d = 0.23), mood (d = 0.16), and metacognitive outcomes (d = 0.30), but not for QOL (d = 0.10). Computerized studies appeared to benefit mood (depression, anxiety, and apathy) compared to controls, while therapist-based interventions and multimodal interventions had more impact on ADLs and metacognitive outcomes than control conditions. The results are encouraging that cognitive interventions in MCI may impact everyday life, but considerably more research is needed. The current review and meta-analysis is limited by our use of only PsychInfo and MEDLINE databases, our inability to read full text non-English articles, and our reliance on only published data to complete effect sizes."

The doctor-patient relationship in the healthcare for cognitive decline is in a \"shallow\" medical world. With the development of data science, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and digital twin, the introduction of the concept of the metaverse in medicine has brought alternative and complementary strategies in the intervention of cognitive decline. This article technically analyzes the application scenarios and paradigms of the metaverse in medicine in the field of mental health, such as hospital management, diagnosis, prediction, prevention, rehabilitation, progression delay, assisting life, companionship, and supervision. The metaverse in medicine has made primary progress in education, immersive consultation, dental disease, and Parkinson's disease, bringing revolutionary prospects for non-pharmacological complementary treatment of cognitive decline and other mental problems. In particular, with the demand for non-face-to-face communication generated by the global COVID-19 epidemic, the needs for uncontactable healthcare service for the elderly have increased. The paradigm of self-monitoring, self-healing, and healthcare experienced by the elderly through the metaverse in medicine, especially from meta-platform, meta-community, and meta-hospital, will be generated, which will reconstruct the service modes for the elderly people. The future map of the metaverse in medicine is huge, which depends on the co-construction of community partners."

Among the CCT participants, seed-based analyses revealed decreases in functional connectivity of the PCC and hippocampus with neural substrates in the parietal and occipital regions. The decreased PCC and precuneus connectivity were found to mediate patients' improvements in immediate recall function.\n## CONCLUSION\nAn 8-week CCT program was effective for improving episodic memory in older individuals with MCI. The decrease in connectivity originating from the PCC and hippocampus is suggestive of potential plastic changes in the Papez circuit, which could have alleviated the age-related compensatory mechanism.

New etiological models suggest that cognitive difficulties might not be directly linked to seizure activity, but are rather a manifestation of a broader brain pathology. Consequently, treating seizures is not sufficient to alleviate cognitive symptoms, highlighting the need for novel diagnostic tools. Here, we investigated whether the organization of three intrinsic, resting-state functional connectivity networks was correlated with domain-specific cognitive test performance. Using individualized EEG source reconstruction and graph theory, we examined the association between network small worldness and cognitive test performance in 23 patients with focal epilepsy and 17 healthy controls, who underwent a series of standardized pencil-and-paper and digital cognitive tests. We observed that the specific networks robustly correlated with test performance in distinct cognitive domains. Specifically, correlations were evident between the default mode network and memory in patients, the central-executive network and executive functioning in controls, and the salience network and social cognition in both groups. Interestingly, the correlations were evident in both groups, but in different domains, suggesting an alteration in these functional neurocognitive networks in focal epilepsy.

            "abstract": "Recent studies have focused on the use of technology to support reminiscence but there remains a dearth of research on the health costs and benefits associated with this intervention. The aim of this study was to estimate costs and quality of life associated with a home based, individual specific reminiscence intervention, facilitated by an iPad app for people living with dementia and their family carers, with a view to informing a future cost-effectiveness analysis. Use of community health and social care services, hospital services, prescribed medication and informal caregiving was assessed using an adapted version of the Client and Socio-Demographic Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Quality of life was assessed at baseline, 6-week and 3-month follow-up using the EQ5D, DEMQOL and DEMQOL proxy instruments. Results showed that average health and social care costs were £29,728 per person at baseline (T0) and £33,436 after 3 months (T2). Higher T2 costs were largely accounted for by higher informal caregiving costs. There was an overall increase in health-related quality of life over the duration of the intervention, although there were notable differences in index scores generated by the EQ5D (0.649, 0.652 and 0.719) and DEMQOL instruments (0.845, 0.968 and 0.901). The study concluded that a full cost-effectiveness analysis could incorporate a similar range of cost-categories with minor amendments to the CSRI to improve the accuracy of cost estimation. Furthermore, a larger sample size, randomisation and longer follow-up period are required to allow potential effects of the intervention to be realised and differences between intervention and control groups to be accurately detected."

            "abstract": "Decreased upper-extremity/visuomotor abilities are frequently encountered in healthy aging. However, few studies have assessed hand movements in the prodromal stage of dementia. The evaluation of visuomotor skills in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (PwMCI) may have non-negligible clinical relevance both in diagnostic and prognostic terms, given the strong relationships with executive functioning and functional autonomies. In the present review paper, these issues will be disclosed by describing general pathophysiological and neuropsychological mechanisms responsible for visuomotor deficits, and by reporting the available experimental results on differences in visuomotor functioning between PwMCI, healthy controls and/or patients with dementia. Moreover, the relationships binding visuomotor and executive domains to functional autonomies will be then addressed. Finally, we will propose insights for future research."

            "abstract": "To investigate everyday memory, more and more studies rely on virtual-reality applications to bridge the gap between in situ approaches and laboratory settings. In this vein, the present study was designed to assess everyday-like memory from the virtual reality-based Human Object Memory for Everyday Scenes (HOMES) test (Sauzéon et al., , Exp. Psychol., 59, 99) in ageing and in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two aims motivated this study: the first was to assess multiple processes of episodic memory (EM) functioning embedded within contexts closely related to real life in ageing and AD using the multi-trial free-recall paradigm, and the second aim was to evaluate the mediating effects of executive functioning (EF), EM, and subjective memory complaints (SMCs) on age differences in the HOMES measures and in AD. To this end, the HOMES test and neurocognitive tests of EF and EM were administered to 23 younger adults, 23 older adults, and 16 patients with AD. The results were: firstly, compared to young adults, elderly adults presented only free-recall decline that almost disappeared in recognition condition whereas AD patients exhibited a poor clustering, learning, and recognition performance, and also a high amount of false recognition; secondly, age differences as well as AD related deficits on the HOMES test were mediated by both memory and EF measure while those observed on false memory indices were only mediated by EM measure; thirdly, the HOMES indices are related to SMCs even when episodic or EF measures are controlled. Overall, the results supported the fact that the VR-based memory test is an appropriate device to capture age-related differences as well as the AD effect with respect to both in situ and laboratory settings."

            "abstract": "Animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be used to determine the progressive neurodegeneration characteristics of AD in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Given the need for therapeutic interventions before the onset of frank AD, it is critical to examine if AD models demonstrate neuroanatomical remodeling in an equivalent preclinical phase. This manuscript examines the trajectories of brain and behavioural changes in the Triple transgenic mouse model (3xTg) prior to the development of AD-like behaviours. The 3xTg mimics both β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles through three mutations associated with familial AD, namely: PS1M146V, APPSwe, and tauP301L transgenes. We performed detailed investigation using longitudinal structural MRI at 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks old to assess neuroanatomical changes using volumetric and deformation-based analyses. Learning- and memory-related behaviour were assessed through the Morris water maze at 9, 17, and 25 weeks of age. There was the absence of major memory deficits with the notable exception of water maze conducted at 17 weeks old, where 3xTg group spent significantly less time in the quadrant of interest in the probe trial. Through volumetric and deformation-based analyses, we observed relative decrease over time in the 3xTg group in the third ventricle, piriform cortex, fornix, and fimbria relative to the control group. We also observed decreases over time in the control mice in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb. In many of these cases, we note a delay in the attainment of peak volume in the 3xTgs relative to the control group, suggesting a possible neurodevelopmental and maturational delay given the likely over-expression of AD-related pathology from birth. Importantly, neuroanatomical alterations are observed prior to the manifestation of AD-like behaviours, suggesting that mutated amyloid and tau are, indeed, sufficient to cause changes in the neuroanatomy in 3xTg mice, but potentially insufficient to be responsible for behavioural changes in the earlier stages of life."

            "abstract": "Three models are described in rats which attempt to mimic morphological and behavioural pathology of Alzheimer's dementia; intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ), permanent bilateral carotid artery occlusion (2VO) and brain mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase inhibition by sodium azide. Learning and memory are impaired within 4 weeks in all models. This probably involves a reduction in cortical and/or hippocampal cholinergic neurotransmission. STZ causes microglial activation and specific damage to myelinated tracts in the fornix through generation of oxidative stress, thereby disrupting connections between the septum and hippocampus. 2VO results in damage to myelin and CA1 cells in hippocampus and in abnormal processing of APP to beta-amyloid. It is not known if microglial activation and neuronal damage occur after sodium azide administration. Memory and learning can be improved in the STZ and 2VO models by estradiol, melatonin and cholinesterase inhibitors. Antioxidants and neuroprotective agents may also decrease memory deficits by preventing inflammation and neurodegeneration."

BACE1 knockout mice lack Abeta and are phenotypically normal, suggesting that therapeutic inhibition of BACE1 may be free of mechanism-based side effects. However, direct evidence that BACE1 inhibition would improve cognition is lacking. Here we show that BACE1 null mice engineered to overexpress human APP (BACE1(-/-).Tg2576(+)) are rescued from Abeta-dependent hippocampal memory deficits. Moreover, impaired hippocampal cholinergic regulation of neuronal excitability found in the Tg2576 AD model is ameliorated in BACE1(-/-).Tg2576(+) bigenic mice. The behavioral and electrophysiological rescue of deficits in BACE1(-/-).Tg2576(+) mice is correlated with a dramatic reduction of cerebral Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels and occurs before amyloid deposition in Tg2576 mice. Our gene-based approach demonstrates that lower Abeta levels are beneficial for AD-associated memory impairments, validating BACE1 as a therapeutic target for AD."

The aim of this systematic review is to comprehensively summarize current evidence assessing potential biomarkers of ECT-related cognitive side effects. Based on our systematic search of human studies indexed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge, a total of 29 studies evaluating patients with MDD undergoing ECT were reviewed. Molecular biomarkers studies did not consistently identify concentration changes in plasma S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), or Aβ peptides significantly associated with cognitive performance after ECT. Importantly, these findings suggest that ECT-related cognitive side effects cannot be explained by mechanisms of neural cell damage. Notwithstanding, S-100b protein and Aβ40 peptide concentrations, as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphisms, have been suggested as potential predictive biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction after ECT. In addition, recent advances in brain imaging have allowed us to identify ECT-induced volumetric and functional changes in several brain structures closely related to memory performance such as the hippocampus.

Thus, targeting Aβ clearance has now been considered a valid therapeutic approach for AD. Cellular uptake and degradation are important mechanisms for Aβ clearance, which are mainly performed by the endosomal-autophagic-lysosomal (EAL) pathway. Our previous study showed that OAB-14, a novel small molecule designed with bexarotene as the lead compound, treatment for 3 months significantly alleviated cognitive disorders and remarkably reduced the deposition of Aβ without affecting its production in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Here, we further revealed that enhancement of the EAL activity is one of the mechanisms that increases Aβ clearance after OAB-14 administration for 3 months. OAB-14 facilitates receptor-mediated endocytosis and restores autophagy flux via the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Meanwhile, OAB-14 enhances the lysosomal activity, and reduced Aβ accumulation in lysosomes was observed in OAB-14-treated AD mice. These results suggest that OAB-14 may promote Aβ clearance in lysosomes by alleviating the EAL dysfunction in AD mice."

As a result of the assumptions inherent in the design of each model, the different cDNA-based transgenic mouse models have revealed different relationships between the biochemical, pathological and behavioral alterations observed in these models. Here we provide further characterization of a genomic-based, amyloid precursor protein yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mouse model of AD, R1.40, that makes few assumptions regarding disease pathogenesis to study the relationship between brain pathology and altered behavior. Aged R1.40 transgenic and control mice were tested for learning and memory in the Morris water maze and for working memory in the Y maze. Results from the water maze demonstrated intact learning in the both control and R1.40 mice, but impairments in the long-term retention of this information in the transgenic mice, but not controls. Interestingly, however, long-term memory deficits did not correlate with the presence of Abeta deposits within the group of animals examined. By contrast, age-related working memory impairments were also observed in the Y maze in the R1.40 mice, and these deficits correlated with the presence of Abeta deposits.

Eight of the participants reported no prior experience with touchscreen technology. Twenty-seven participants completed both self-administered assessments, and 28 completed at least one. Cronbach's alpha (individual tests: .87-.89, composite: .93) and correlations between examiner-administered and self-administered performances (individual tests: .72-.91, composite: .93) were high. The participants who had never used a smartphone or a tablet computer showed comparable consistency. Remote self-administered tablet-based testing in older adults at-risk for cognitive decline is feasible and reliable, even among participants without prior technology experience."

            "title": "Virtual Reality Triage Training Can Provide Comparable Simulation Efficacy for Paramedicine Students Compared to Live Simulation-Based Scenarios.",
            "abstract": "Background: Mass-casualty incidents (MCIs) are catastrophic. Whether they arise from natural or man-made disasters, the nature of such incidents and the multiple casualties involved can rapidly overwhelm response personnel. Mass-casualty triage training is traditionally taught via either didactic lectures or table top exercises. This training fails to provide an opportunity for practical application or experiential learning in immersive conditions. Further, large-scale simulations are heavily resource-intensive, logistically challenging, require the coordination and time of multiple personnel, and are costly to replicate. This study compared the simulation efficacy of a bespoke virtual-reality (VR) MCI simulation with an equivalent live simulation scenario designed for undergraduate paramedicine students. Methods: Both simulations involved ten injured patients resulting from a police car chase and shooting. Twenty-nine second-year paramedicine students completed the live and VR simulation in a random order. The training efficacy of the VR and live simulation was evaluated with respect to student immersion and task-difficulty, clinical decision-making (i.e. triage card allocation accuracy and timeliness), learning satisfaction, and cost of delivery. Results: While perceived physical demand was higher in the live simulation compared to VR (p < 0.001), no differences were observed across mental demand, temporal demand, performance, effort or frustration domains. No differences were found for participant satisfaction across the two platforms. No differences were observed in the number of triage cards correctly allocated to patients in each platform. However, participants were able to allocate cards far quicker in VR (p < .001). Cost of running the VR came to AUD $712.04 (staff time), compared to the live simulations which came to AUD $9,413.71 (staff time, moulage, actors, director, prop vehicle), approximately 13 times more expensive. Conclusion: The VR simulation provided near identical simulation efficacy for paramedicine students compared to the live simulation. VR MCI training resources represent an exciting new direction for authentic and cost-effective education and training for medical professionals."

In each group, the intervention lasted 3 consecutive weeks (4 individual face-to-face sessions/week). Neuropsychological assessment was administered at baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1). Outcome measures at T0 and T1 were compared within and between groups. The Montreal Overall Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was taken as the primary outcome measure.\n## RESULTS\nUnlike the PCT group and the CG, the patients receiving CCT showed significant medium/large effect size improvements in MoCA performance, global cognition, executive functions, and attention/processing speed. No baseline individual/demographic variables were associated with greater gains from the intervention, although a negative correlation with baseline MoCA performance was found.\n## CONCLUSION\nCCT proved effective in PD-MCI patients when compared with traditional PCT. Further follow-up assessments are being conducted to verify the retention of the gains and the potential ability of the tool to delay conversion to PD-dementia.

Participants were assessed pre/post using untrained measures of cognition and self-report questionnaires. Primary outcome measures were recall of unrelated word pairs both immediately following presentation and following a delay. Secondary outcomes were a measure of attention, cognitive flexibility, and visual working memory. Participants were also asked to report on the frequency of cognitive failures and mood before and after training. Participants (N = 31) were randomized into either the treatment or a no-contact control group and attended the clinic twice per week over a four week period. Twenty-four participants completed the study (twelve in each group). Results indicated that the training group improved at recalling unrelated word pairs after a delay.

We hypothesized that people would sway more in anterior-posterior (AP) direction when they were exposed to a VR environment where we intentionally provoked movements in forward and backward directions. A total of 14 healthy older adults (OA) (73.14±4.26 years) and 15 healthy young adults (YA) (24.93±1.49 years) were assessed for group differences in sway behavior. Body sway speed in 22 different conditions with and without VR environments was analyzed. Significant differences and large effect sizes were observed in AP sway under the VR environments (OA with P < 0.02; effect size> 0.61, YA with P < 0.003; effect size> 0.72) compared to the baseline condition without the VR environments. In addition, significant differences were found between the two groups in AP sway in all test conditions (P < 0.01). Our study shows that a VR environment can trigger body sway in an expected direction, which may indicate that it is possible to enhance the sensitivity of balance assessment by integrating immersive VR environments. The result of this study warrants a cross-sectional study in which OA diagnosed with and without dementia are compared on their sway behavior."

Small to moderate effects were found for global cognition, attention, working memory, learning, and memory, with the exception of nonverbal memory, and for psychosocial functioning, including depressive symptoms.

Remote monitoring technologies (RMTs), such as smartphone applications, wearables, and home-based sensors, can change these periodic subjective assessments to more frequent, or even continuous, objective monitoring. The aim of the RADAR-AD study is to assess the accuracy and validity of RMTs in measuring functional decline in a real-world environment across preclinical-to-moderate stages of AD compared to standard clinical rating scales.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study includes three tiers. For the main study, we will include participants (n = 220) with preclinical AD, prodromal AD, mild-to-moderate AD, and healthy controls, classified by MMSE and CDR score, from clinical sites equally distributed over 13 European countries. Participants will undergo extensive neuropsychological testing and physical examination.

In the first sub-study, fixed sensors will be installed in the homes of a representative sub-sample of 40 participants. In the second sub-study, 10 participants will stay in a smart home for 1 week. The primary outcome of this study is the difference in functional domain profiles assessed using RMTs between the four study groups. The four participant groups will be compared for each RMT outcome measure separately. Each RMT outcome will be compared to a standard clinical test which measures the same functional or cognitive domain. Finally, multivariate prediction models will be developed. Data collection and privacy are important aspects of the project, which will be managed using the RADAR-base data platform running on specifically designed biomedical research computing infrastructure.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      First results are expected to be disseminated in 2022.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our study is well placed to evaluate the clinical utility of RMT assessments.

The aims of this study were to (a) investigate the spatial navigation abilities of AD patients in VR environments as well as in a real world community setting and (b) explore whether we could predict patients at a high risk for spatial disorientation in the community based on their VR navigation. Sixteen community-dwelling AD patients and 21 age/gender matched controls were assessed on their egocentric and allocentric navigation abilities in VR environments using the Virtual Supermarket Test (VST) and Sea Hero Quest (SHQ) as well as in the community using the Detour Navigation Test (DNT). When compared to controls, AD patients exhibited impairments on the VST, SHQ, and DNT. For patients, only SHQ wayfinding distance and wayfinding duration significantly predicted composite disorientation score on the DNT (β = 0.422, p = 0.034, R2 = 0.299 and β = 0.357, p = 0.046, R2 = 0.27 respectively). However, these same VR measures could not reliably predict which patients were at highest risk of spatial disorientation in the community (p > 0.1).

Caring in this environment can be complex, challenging and stressful for staff; this can affect the quality of care provided to residents, lead to staff strain and burnout, and increase sickness, absence and turnover rates. It is therefore important to find interventions to increase the wellbeing of staff that will not only benefit staff themselves but also residents and care providers. Mindfulness training is known to be effective in treating a variety of physical and mental health conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and design:\n        \n      \n      The study uses mixed methods centred on a stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial. Thirty care homes in Wales are implementing a brief web-based mindfulness training course, starting in random sequence. Four to ten consenting staff from each facility undertake the course and complete validated questionnaires at baseline and after eight and 20 weeks. We shall also interview a stratified sample of ten trained staff and analyse the transcripts thematically. The primary outcome is stress; secondary outcomes include job satisfaction, attitudes towards residents and sickness absence rates.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      With increasing numbers of people living with dementia in care homes and causing stress in their carers, it is important to evaluate support strategies for staff.

The e-learning course was delivered three times to professional caregivers between July and December 2020. Caregivers who completed the course assessed the level of neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with dementia using the total score from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) via a web-based tool. The primary outcome measures were the number of caregivers who implemented follow-up NPI evaluations by March 2021 and the change in NPI scores from baseline to their most recent follow-up evaluations. As a control group, information was also obtained from professional caregivers who completed a face-to-face training course using the same web-based tool between July 2019 and March 2020.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 268 caregivers completed the e-learning course in 2020.

The average NPI score was significantly reduced from baseline (mean 20.4, SD 16.2) to the most recent follow-up evaluations (mean 14.3, SD 13.4). The effect size was assumed to be medium (Cohen drm [repeated measures]=0.40). The control group consisted of 252 caregivers who completed a face-to-face training course.

Compared to the control group, caregivers who completed the e-learning course were significantly less likely to implement follow-up evaluations (χ21=52.0, P<.001). The change in NPI scores did not differ according to the type of training course (baseline-adjusted difference=-0.61, P=.69).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The replacement of face-to-face training with e-learning may have provided professionals with an opportunity to participate in the dementia behavior analysis and support enhancement (DEMBASE) program who may not have participated in the program otherwise. Although the program showed equal efficacy in terms of the two training courses, the feasibility was suboptimal with lower implementation levels for those receiving e-learning training. Thus, further strategies should be developed to improve feasibility by providing motivational triggers for implementation and technical support for care professionals. Using online communities in the program should also be investigated."

            "abstract": "The rise in dementia and the evidence of cognitive benefits of exercise for the older adult population together make salient the research into variables affecting cognitive benefit and exercise behavior. One promising avenue for increasing exercise participation has been the introduction of exergaming, a type of exercise that works in combination with virtual reality to enhance both the exercise experience and health outcomes. Past research has revealed that executive function (EF) was related to greater use of self-regulatory strategies, which in turn was related to greater adherence to exercise following an intervention (McAuley et al., 2011). Best et al. (2014) found improvement in EF related to adherence to exercise post- intervention. Anderson-Hanley et al. (2012) found that for older adults aerobic exergaming yielded greater cognitive benefit than traditional exercise alone; however, questions remain as to the possible impact of greater cognitive benefit and other factors on participants' involvement in exercise following the end of an intervention. The current study presents follow-up data exploring the relationship between EF, self-regulation, and exercise behavior in the post-intervention (naturalistic) period. Herein, it was predicted that higher EF at the start of the naturalistic window, would predict subsequent exercise with an exergame. Contrary to expectations, results suggest that those with poorer EF are likely to exergame more frequently. The results of this study contradict previous literature, but suggest an interesting relationship between EF, self-regulation, and exercise behaviors when exergaming is employed, particularly with older adults with some cognitive decline. We hypothesize that other factors may be at work, perhaps expectation of cognitive benefit might act as a unique motivator."

Distinguishing static impairment from on-going decline is clinically important, but the field lacks well-validated cognitive measures sensitive to decline and feasible for routine clinical use. Measures capable of detecting improvement are also needed to assess interventions. The objective of this study is to estimate the extent of change on repeat administration of three different forms of a brief computerized cognitive assessment battery (B-CAM) developed for assessing cognitive ability in the mildly-impaired to normal range in people living with HIV.

This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2010.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the impact of occupational therapy on activities of daily living (ADL), both basic and instrumental, global cognitive function, and specific cognitive abilities in people who have cognitive impairment following a stroke.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases (all last searched September 2020), trial registries, and reference lists.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that evaluated an intervention for adults with clinically defined stroke and confirmed cognitive impairment. The intervention needed either to be provided by an occupational therapist or considered within the scope of occupational therapy practice as defined in the review. We excluded studies focusing on apraxia or perceptual impairments or virtual reality interventions as these are covered by other Cochrane Reviews. The primary outcome was basic activities of daily living (BADL) such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. Secondary outcomes were instrumental ADL (IADL) (e.g. shopping and meal preparation), community integration and participation, global cognitive function and specific cognitive abilities (including attention, memory, executive function, or a combination of these), and subdomains of these abilities. We included both observed and self-reported outcome measures.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently selected studies that met the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of the evidence. A third review author moderated disagreements if consensus was not reached. We contacted trial authors for additional information and data, where available. We assessed the certainty of key outcomes using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 24 trials from 11 countries involving 1142 (analysed) participants (two weeks to eight years since stroke onset). This update includes 23 new trials in addition to the one study included in the previous version. Most were parallel randomised controlled trials except for one cross-over trial and one with a two-by-two factorial design. Most studies had sample sizes under 50 participants. Twenty studies involved a remediation approach to cognitive rehabilitation, particularly using computer-based interventions. The other four involved a compensatory and adaptive approach. The length of interventions ranged from 10 days to 18 weeks, with a mean total length of 19 hours. Control groups mostly received usual rehabilitation or occupational therapy care, with a few receiving an attention control that was comparable to usual care; two had no intervention (i.e. a waiting list). Apart from high risk of performance bias for all but one of the studies, the risk of bias for other aspects was mostly low or unclear. For the primary outcome of BADL, meta-analysis found a small effect on completion of the intervention with a mean difference (MD) of 2.26 on the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 4.22; P = 0.03, I2 = 0%; 6 studies, 336 participants; low-certainty evidence). Therefore, on average, BADL improved by 2.26 points on the FIM that ranges from 18 (total assist) to 126 (complete independence). On follow-up, there was insufficient evidence of an effect at three months (MD 10.00, 95% CI -0.54 to 20.55; P = 0.06, I2 = 53%; 2 studies, 73 participants; low-certainty evidence), but evidence of an effect at six months (MD 11.38, 95% CI 1.62 to 21.14, I2 = 12%; 2 studies, 73 participants; low-certainty evidence). These differences are below 22 points which is the established minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the FIM for people with stroke. For IADL, the evidence is very uncertain about an effect (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.94, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.47; P = 0.0005, I2 = 98%; 2 studies, 88 participants). For community integration, we found insufficient evidence of an effect (SMD 0.09, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.54; P = 0.68, I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 78 participants). There was an improvement of clinical importance in global cognitive functional performance after the intervention (SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.54; P = 0.0004, I2 = 0%; 9 studies, 432 participants; low-certainty evidence), equating to 1.63 points on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (95% CI 0.75 to 2.52), which exceeds the anchor-based MCID of the MoCA for stroke rehabilitation patients of 1.22. We found some effect for attention overall (SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.15; P = 0.0002, I2 = 20%; 13 studies, 620 participants; low-certainty evidence), equating to a difference of 17.31 seconds (95% CI 8.38 to 26.24), and for executive functional performance overall (SMD 0.49, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.66; P < 0.00001, I2 = 74%; 11 studies, 550 participants; very low-certainty evidence), equating to 1.41 points on the Frontal Assessment Battery (range: 0-18). Of the cognitive subdomains, we found evidence of effect of possible clinical importance, immediately after intervention, for sustained visual attention (moderate certainty) equating to 15.63 seconds, for working memory (low certainty) equating to 59.9 seconds, and thinking flexibly (low certainty), compared to control.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The effectiveness of occupational therapy for cognitive impairment poststroke remains unclear. Occupational therapy may result in little to no clinical difference in BADL immediately after intervention and at three and six months' follow-up. Occupational therapy may slightly improve global cognitive performance of a clinically important difference immediately after intervention, likely improves sustained visual attention slightly, and may slightly increase working memory and flexible thinking after intervention. There is evidence of low or very low certainty or insufficient evidence for effect on other cognitive domains, IADL, and community integration and participation. Given the low certainty of much of the evidence in our review, more research is needed to support or refute the effectiveness of occupational therapy for cognitive impairment after stroke. Future trials need improved methodology to address issues including risk of bias and to better report the outcome measures and interventions used."

            "abstract": "Amyloid-β (Aβ) is considered partially responsible for cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Resveratrol is known as an anti-neurotoxicity potential natural product, however low blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permissibility and low oral-bioavailability (OB) are the main limitations on its clinical potential. In this study, we illustrated that Pterostilbene (PTS), a kind of resveratrol analog which showed higher scores on BBB and OB, could overcome Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. In silico simulation indicated PTS binding with PDE4A may contribute to its anti-apoptosis and anti-neurotoxicity effects. Behavioral tests further confirmed PTS' potential of overcoming memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice (AD model). Interestingly, PTS also rescued the reducing in dendritic spine density in APP/PS1 mice based on Golgi-Cox staining. Besides, as results of reversing Aβ-induced decreases in cyclic-AMP level, PTS increased the pVASP, pCREB, BDNF, and PSD95 expression. Overall, PTS protects neurons against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive dysfunction through regulating the PDE4A-CREB-BDNF pathway. Therefore, targeting on PDE4A, PTS would be a qualified natural product for alleviating Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in AD."

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) characterizes a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the brain, while AD patients are afflicted with irreversible loss of neurons and further the intellectual abilities including memory and reasoning. One of the typical hallmarks of AD is the deposition of senile plaque that is contributed mainly by amyloid-beta (Abeta), whose production is initiated by beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Inhibition of BACE1 is thereby regarded as an attractive strategy for anti-AD drug discovery. Here, we reported that the natural product 2,2',4'-trihydroxychalcone (TDC) from Glycyrrhiza glabra functioned as a specific non-competitive inhibitor against BACE1 enzyme, and potently repressed beta-cleavage of APP and production of Abeta in human embryo kidney cells-APPswe cells. Moreover, the amelioration ability of this compound against the in vivo memory impairment was further evaluated by APP-PS1 double transgenic mice model. It is discovered that treatment of 9 mg/kg/day of TDC could obviously decrease Abeta production and Abeta plaque formation, while efficiently improve the memory impairment based on Morris water maze test. Our findings thus demonstrated that the natural product TDC as a new BACE1 inhibitor could ameliorate memory impairment in mice, and is expected to be potentially used as a lead compound for further anti-AD reagent development."

But the underlying mechanism remains ambiguous. Increasing evidence supports the crucial role of astrocyte reactivity in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we attempt to explore the underlying mechanisms of SYG from astrocyte reactivity in Aβ1-42-induced rat model of Alzheimer's disease. After SYG treatment, the impairment of learning and memory induced by Aβ1-42 was significantly improved and the hippocampal neuron damages were alleviated. Additionally, the activity of glutamine synthetase and the concentration of glutamate, which might be involved in the cognitive dysfunctions, were outstandingly reduced. Meanwhile, the astrocyte reactivity was also remarkably inhibited. The expressions of JAK2 and STAT3, key proteins in the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway that is tightly associated with reactive astrocytes, were clearly attenuated, too. Collectively, our data demonstrate that SYG might exert protective effects on cognitive impairment induced by amyloid-β oligomers via inhibition of astrocyte reactivity regulated by the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. It may be a potential therapeutic for cognitive dysfunctions in many neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease."

            "abstract": "Computational modeling predicts that the hippocampus plays an important role in the ability to apply previously learned information to novel problems and situations (referred to as the ability to generalize information or simply as 'transfer learning'). These predictions have been tested in humans using a computer-based task on which individuals with hippocampal damage are able to learn a series of complex discriminations with two stimulus features (shape and color), but are impaired in their ability to transfer this information to newly configured problems in which one of the features is altered. This deficit occurs despite the fact that the feature predictive of the reward (the relevant information) is not changed. The goal of the current study was to develop a mouse analog of transfer learning and to determine if this new task was sensitive to pathological changes in a mouse model of AD. We describe a task in which mice were able to learn a series of concurrent discriminations that contained two stimulus features (odor and digging media) and could transfer this learned information to new problems in which the irrelevant feature in each discrimination pair was altered. Moreover, we report age-dependent deficits specific to transfer learning in APP+PS1 mice relative to non-transgenic littermates. The robust impairment in transfer learning may be more sensitive to AD-like pathology than traditional cognitive assessments in that no deficits were observed in the APP+PS1 mice on the widely used Morris water maze task. These data describe a novel and sensitive paradigm to evaluate mnemonic decline in AD mouse models that has unique translational advantages over standard species-specific cognitive assessments (e.g., water maze for rodent and delayed paragraph recall for humans)."

Search behaviour was unconstrained other than by the walls of the arena. All mice acquired the task within 4 days of training, with one trial per day. Experiment 1 tested the hypothesis that hippocampal lesions would disrupt foraging behaviour using extramaze cues. Mice with hippocampal lesions showed normal latency to initiate foraging and to complete the task relative to sham-operated mice. However, lesioned mice showed increased perseverative responding (sensitization) to recently rewarded locations, increased total working memory errors and an increased propensity to search near previously rewarded locations. In Experiment 2, the extramaze cues were obscured and each pot was identified by a unique pattern. Under these conditions, mice with hippocampal lesions showed comparable working memory errors to control mice. However, lesioned mice continued to display increased perseverative responding and altered search strategies. Experiment 3 tested the hypothesis that age-related accumulation of amyloid would disrupt foraging behaviour in transgenic PDAPP mice expressing the V717F amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutation. Consistent with previous findings, PDAPP mice showed both age-dependent and age-independent behavioural changes. More specifically, 14-16 month-old PDAPP mice showed a deficit in perseverative responding and working memory errors. In contrast, changes in search behaviour, such as systematic circling, were present throughout development. The latter indicates that APP overexpression contributed to some features of the PDAPP behavioural phenotype, whereas working memory and flexible responding was sensitive to ageing and β-amyloid burden. In conclusion, the present study provided novel insight into the role of the hippocampus and the effects of APP overexpression on memory and search behaviour in an open-field foraging task."

            "abstract": "Research in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) produced inconsistent results in demonstrating an association between patients' symptom severity and their cognitive impairments. The process involved in volition aspects of behavioral syndromes can be extensively analyzed using specific tests developed in virtual environments, more suitable to manipulate rules and possible breaks of the normal task execution with different, confusing or stopping instructions. The study involved thirty participants (15 OCD patients and 15 controls) during task execution and the relative interferences. At this purpose, the virtual version of Multiple Errands Test was used. Virtual reality setting, with a higher ecological validity respect to a classic neuropsychological battery, allowed us to take into account deficits of volition and the relative dysexecutive functions associated with OCD patients. The proposed paradigm also allows the development of innovative prototypes of coevolving technologies based on new theories and models and deeper understanding of human behavior."

The objective of this systematic review was to examine the literature regarding the use of cognitive and cognitive-motor interventions to improve physical functioning in older adults or people with neurological impairments that are similar to cognitive impairments seen in aging.

Approaches include stem cell transplantation, which improved memory in several animal studies as well as vaccination against Alzheimer´s disease (AD) by β-amyloid antibodies.

Different drugs, such as erythropoietin or antiplatelet therapy, improve memory in neuropsychiatric diseases or AD or at least in animal studies. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid-rich diets improve memory through the gut-brain axis by altering the gut flora through probiotics. Sports, dancing, and memory techniques (e.g., Method of Loci) utilize behavioral approaches for memory enhancement, and were effective in several studies. Augmented reality (AR) is an auspicious way for enhancing memory in real time. Future approaches may include memory prosthesis for head-injured patients and light therapy for restoring memory in AD.

            "abstract": "Most neuropsychological assessments of episodic memory bear little similarity to the events that patients actually experience as memories in daily life. The first aim of this study was to use a virtual environment to characterize episodic memory profiles in an ecological fashion, which includes memory for central and perceptual details, spatiotemporal contextual elements, and binding. This study included subjects from three different populations: healthy older adults, patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and patients with early to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Second, we sought to determine whether environmental factors that can affect encoding (active vs. passive exploration) influence memory performance in pathological aging. Third, we benchmarked the results of our virtual reality episodic memory test against a classical memory test and a subjective daily memory complaint scale. Here, the participants were successively immersed in two virtual environments; the first, as the driver of a virtual car (active exploration) and the second, as the passenger of that car (passive exploration). Subjects were instructed to encode all elements of the environment as well as the associated spatiotemporal contexts. Following each immersion, we assessed the patient's recall and recognition of central information (i.e., the elements of the environment), contextual information (i.e., temporal, egocentric and allocentric spatial information) and lastly, the quality of binding. We found that the AD patients' performances were inferior to that of the aMCI and even more to that of the healthy aged groups, in line with the progression of hippocampal atrophy reported in the literature. Spatial allocentric memory assessments were found to be particularly useful for distinguishing aMCI patients from healthy older adults. Active exploration yielded enhanced recall of central and allocentric spatial information, as well as binding in all groups. This led aMCI patients to achieve better performance scores on immediate temporal memory tasks. Finally, the patients' daily memory complaints were more highly correlated with the performances on the virtual test than with their performances on the classical memory test. Taken together, these results highlight specific cognitive differences found between these three populations that may provide additional insight into the early diagnosis and rehabilitation of pathological aging. In particular, neuropsychological studies would benefit to use virtual tests and a multi-component approach to assess episodic memory, and encourage active encoding of information in patients suffering from mild or severe age-related memory impairment. The beneficial effect of active encoding on episodic memory in aMCI and early to moderate AD is discussed in the context of relatively preserved frontal and motor brain functions implicated in self-referential effects and procedural abilities."

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used to treat a variety of brain disorders and shows promise in alleviating cognitive symptoms in some AD patients (Laxton et al, 2010). We previously showed that DBS of the entorhinal cortex (EC) enhances spatial memory formation in normal (wild-type) mice (Stone et al, 2011). Here we tested the effects of EC-DBS on the progressive cognitive deficits in a genetically-based mouse model of AD. TgCRND8 (Tg) transgenic mice express human amyloid precursor protein harboring the Swedish and Indiana familial AD mutations. These mice exhibit age-related increases in Aβ production, plaque deposition, as well as contextual fear and spatial memory impairments. Here, we found EC stimulation in young mice (6 weeks old) rescued the early contextual fear and spatial memory deficits and decreased subsequent plaque load in Tg mice. Moreover, stimulation in older mice (6 months old) was also sufficient to rescue the memory deficits in Tg mice. The memory enhancement induced by DBS emerged gradually (over the course of weeks) and was both persistent and specific to hippocampal-based memories. These results provide further support for the development of novel therapeutics aimed to resolve the cognitive decline and memory impairment in AD using DBS of hippocampal afferents."

In memory assessment, the use of VR could provide more comprehensive, ecologically-valid, and controlled evaluations of prospective, incidental, and spatial memory in a rehabilitation setting than is possible using standardized assessment tests. The additional knowledge gained from these assessments could more effectively direct rehabilitation towards specific impairments of individual patients. In memory remediation, VR training has been found to promote procedural learning in people with memory impairments, and this learning has been found to transfer to improved real-world performance.

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of mental dementia in the aged population. AD is characterized by the progressive decline of memory and multiple cognitive functions, and changes in behavior and personality. Recent research has revealed age-dependent increased levels of VDAC1 in postmortem AD brains and cerebral cortices of APP, APPxPS1, and 3xAD.Tg mice. Further, we found abnormal interaction between VDAC1 and P-Tau in the AD brains, leading to mitochondrial structural and functional defects. Our current study aimed to understand the impact of a partial reduction of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) protein on mitophagy/autophagy, mitochondrial and synaptic activities, and behavior changes in transgenic TAU mice in Alzheimer's disease. To determine if a partial reduction of VDAC1 reduces mitochondrial and synaptic toxicities in transgenic Tau (P301L) mice, we crossed heterozygote VDAC1 knockout (VDAC1+/- ) mice with TAU mice and generated double mutant (VDAC1+/- /TAU) mice. We assessed phenotypic behavior, protein levels of mitophagy, autophagy, synaptic, other key proteins, mitochondrial morphology, and dendritic spines in TAU mice relative to double mutant mice. Partial reduction of VDAC1 rescued the TAU-induced behavioral impairments such as motor coordination and exploratory behavioral changes, and learning and spatial memory impairments in VDAC1+/- /TAU mice. Protein levels of mitophagy, autophagy, and synaptic proteins were significantly increased in double mutant mice compared with TAU mice. In addition, dendritic spines were significantly increased; the mitochondrial number was significantly reduced, and mitochondrial length was increased in double mutant mice. Based on these observations, we conclude that reduced VDAC1 is beneficial in symptomatic-transgenic TAU mice."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Early detection and monitoring of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients are key to tackling dementia and providing benefits to patients, caregivers, healthcare providers and society. We developed the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (ICA); a 5-min, language independent computerised cognitive test that employs an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to improve its accuracy in detecting cognitive impairment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the generalisability of the ICA in detecting cognitive impairment in MCI and mild AD patients. Methods: We studied the ICA in 230 participants. 95 healthy volunteers, 80 MCI, and 55 mild AD participants completed the ICA, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE) cognitive tests. Results: The ICA demonstrated convergent validity with MoCA (Pearson r=0.58, p<0.0001) and ACE (r=0.62, p<0.0001). The ICA AI model was able to detect cognitive impairment with an AUC of 81% for MCI patients, and 88% for mild AD patients. The AI model demonstrated improved performance with increased training data and showed generalisability in performance from one population to another. The ICA correlation of 0.17 (p = 0.01) with education years is considerably smaller than that of MoCA (r = 0.34, p < 0.0001) and ACE (r = 0.41, p < 0.0001) which displayed significant correlations. In a separate study the ICA demonstrated no significant practise effect over the duration of the study. Discussion: The ICA can support clinicians by aiding accurate diagnosis of MCI and AD and is appropriate for large-scale screening of cognitive impairment. The ICA is unbiased by differences in language, culture, and education."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Cognitive impairment is a health problem that concerns almost every second elderly person. Physical and cognitive training have differential positive effects on cognition, but have been rarely applied in combination. This study evaluates synergistic effects of multicomponent physical exercise complemented with novel simultaneous cognitive training on cognition in older adults. We hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive-physical components would add training specific cognitive benefits compared to exclusively physical training.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Seniors, older than 70 years, without cognitive impairment, were randomly assigned to either: 1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill walking (PHYS). Each program was complemented with strength and balance exercises. Two 1-hour training sessions per week over 6 months were applied. Cognitive performance was assessed at baseline, after 3 and 6 months, and at 1-year follow-up. Multiple regression analyses with planned comparisons were calculated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eighty-nine participants were randomized to the three groups initially, 71 completed the training, while 47 were available at 1-year follow-up. Advantages of the simultaneous cognitive-physical programs were found in two dimensions of executive function. \"Shifting attention\" showed a time×intervention interaction in favor of DANCE/MEMORY versus PHYS (F[2, 68] =1.95, trend P=0.075, r=0.17); and \"working memory\" showed a time×intervention interaction in favor of DANCE versus MEMORY (F[1, 136] =2.71, trend P=0.051, R (2)=0.006). Performance improvements in executive functions, long-term visual memory (episodic memory), and processing speed were maintained at follow-up in all groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Particular executive functions benefit from simultaneous cognitive-physical training compared to exclusively physical multicomponent training.

            "abstract": "It is well known that physical exercise has beneficial effects on cognitive function in older adults. Recently, several physical exercise programs with virtual reality (VR) have been proposed to support physical exercise benefits. However, it is still unclear whether VR physical exercise (VR-PE) has positive effects on cognitive function in older adults. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review (SR) of the effects of VR-PE on cognitive function in older adults with and without cognitive decline. We used academic databases to search for research papers. The criteria were intervention study using any VR-PE, participants were older adults with and without mild cognitive decline (not dementia), and cognitive functions were assessed. We found that 6 of 11 eligible studies reported the significant benefits of the VR-PE on a wide range of cognitive functions in aging populations. The SR revealed that VR-PE has beneficial effects on the inhibition of executive functions in older adults with and without mild cognitive decline. Moreover, VR-PE selectively leads to improvements in shifting and general cognitive performance in healthy older adults. The SR suggests that VR-PE could be a successful approach to improve cognitive function in older adults with and without cognitive decline."

In addition, chronic activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes triggered by amyloid β peptide (Aβ) in microglia contributes to persistent neuroinflammation. Here, the primary goal was to assess whether Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a plant flavonoid compound, is effective therapies for AD; it is crucial to know whether DHM will affect microglial activation and neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      After DHM was intraperitoneally injected in APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice, we assessed the effect of DHM on microglial activation, the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components, and the production of inflammatory cytokine IL-1β by immunofluorescence and Western blot. To determine whether DHM play roles in the Aβ production and deposition, amyloid β protein precursor (APP) and β-site APP cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1), as well as neprilysin (NEP), were detected by Western blot. Finally, behavior was tested by Morris Water Maze to illustrate whether DHM treatment has a significantly positive effect on ameliorating the memory and cognition deficits in AD.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Dihydromyricetin treatment significantly ameliorated memory and cognition deficits and decreased the number of activated microglia in the hippocampus and cortex of APP/PS1 mice. In addition, APP/PS1 mice show reduced activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and reduced expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Furthermore, DHM could promote clearance of Aβ, a trigger for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, by increasing levels of NEP and shift microglial conversion to the M2-specific agrinase-1-positive cell phenotype, which enhances microglial clearance of Aβ and its aggregates but not production of Aβ.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Taken together, our findings suggest that DHM prevents progression of AD-like pathology through inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome-based microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and may be a promising therapeutic drug for treating AD."

However, the neuropsychological profile of children with VL remains largely under-investigated in the scientific literature. Although previous research has shown that children with VL may experience some degree of delayed motor development, it is not yet clear if VL could also lead to specific delayed cognitive development. In this study, we will present the development and validation of a new tablet-based computerized test battery (VSAD) that evaluates visuospatial working memory, mental rotation, selective attention, and space orientation abilities. Thirteen children with VL and 54 average-age matched healthy children performed the VSAD and classical paper-and-pencil neuropsychological tasks twice within a 1-month interval. Our results demonstrated a good concurrent validity with strong correlations between the visuospatial working memory, mental rotation, and space orientation tests of the VSAD and classical tasks. Test-retest reliability was also supported through good intra-class coefficients. However, the test of selective attention showed no concurrent validity with the matched classical task. The discriminant validity of the VSAD was partially supported for visuospatial working memory and mental rotation performance accuracy. The VSAD shows good concurrent validity and reliability for measuring visuospatial working memory, mental rotation, and space orientation in children with VL. Future studies are needed to extend discriminant validity with other populations."

In this study, we assessed the effects of puzzle video game training on subsequent mental rotation (MR) and mental folding (MF) performance among adults with no cognitive impairment. We assessed participants at baseline with the Shepard-Metzler MR test followed by the differential aptitude test: space relations MF test (i.e., far transfer). We ranked participants' skills on these pre-tests and used a matching technique to form two skill groups from which we then randomly assigned members of each skill group either to an experimental group or a wait-list control group. The experimental group played two puzzle video games closely related to two-dimensional and three-dimensional MR tasks during 4-week training sessions (total of 12 hour of video games). Post-training, participants completed the MR and MF tests again. Two months later, we re-assessed only the experimental group's spatial skills to explore the sustainability of the trained performance. In addition to response times (RT) and error scores (ES), reported separately, we combined these variables into rate correct scores (RCS) to form an integrated measure of potential speed-accuracy trade-offs (SAT). As a result, we did not find significant improvements in MR performance from CCT engagement, nor did participants show a transfer of skills obtained by practicing MR-related puzzle games to a MF task. Based on the current findings, we urge caution when proposing a game-based intervention as a training tool to enhance spatial abilities. We argue that separately interpreting individual test measures can be misleading, as they only partially represent performance. In contrast, composite scores illuminate underlying cognitive strategies and best determine whether an observed improvement is attributable to enhanced capacities or individual heuristics and learned cognitive shortcuts."

OS of hippocampal neuron was detected. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay showed that the content of Aβ protein and its oligomers in EMP-exposed rats were higher than that of sham-exposed rats. The content of Beta Site App Cleaving Enzyme (BACE1) and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II) in EMP-exposed rats hippocampus were also higher than that of sham-exposed rats. SOD activity and GSH content in EMP-exposed rats were lower than sham-exposed rats (p<0.05). Several mechanisms were proposed based on EMP exposure-induced OS, including increased amyloid precursor protein (APP) aberrant cleavage. Although further study is needed, the present results suggest that long-term EMP exposure is harmful to cognitive ability in rats and could induce AD-like pathological manifestation."

            "abstract": "Cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP cooperate to ensure memory acquisition and consolidation. Increasing their levels by phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE-Is) enhanced cognitive functions and rescued memory loss in different models of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, side effects due to the high doses used limited their application in humans. Based on previous studies suggesting that combinations of sub-efficacious doses of cAMP- and cGMP-specific PDE-Is improved synaptic plasticity and memory in physiological conditions, here we aimed to study whether this treatment was effective to counteract the AD phenotype in APPswe mice. We found that a 3-week chronic treatment with a combination of sub-efficacious doses of the cAMP-specific PDE4-I roflumilast (0.01 mg/kg) and the cGMP-specific PDE5-I vardenafil (0.1 mg/kg) improved recognition, spatial and contextual fear memory. Importantly, the cognitive enhancement persisted for 2 months beyond administration. This long-lasting action, and the possibility to minimize side effects due to the low doses used, might open feasible therapeutic strategies against AD."

However, identification of clinically meaningful cognitive and functional outcomes for individuals who are, by definition, asymptomatic remains a significant challenge. Clinical trials for prevention and early intervention require measures with increased sensitivity to subtle deficits in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) that comprise the first functional declines in prodromal disease.

Participants with SCD also performed significantly worse than controls on objective cognitive measures. VRFCAT performance was strongly correlated with cognitive performance. In the SCD group, VRFCAT performance was strongly correlated with cognitive performance across nearly all tests with significant correlation coefficients ranging from 0.3 to 0.7; VRFCAT summary measures all had correlations greater than r=0.5 with MoCA performance and BAC App Verbal Memory (p<0.01 for all).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Findings suggest the VRFCAT provides a sensitive tool for evaluation of IADL functioning in individuals with subjective cognitive decline.

            "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. A number of studies demonstrated that AD patients exhibit reduced BDNF levels in the brain and the blood serum, and in addition, several animal-based studies indicated a potential protective effect of BDNF against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. In order to further investigate the role of BDNF in the etiology of AD, we created a novel mouse model by crossing a well-established AD mouse model (APP/PS1) with a mouse exhibiting a chronic BDNF deficiency (BDNF(+/-)). This new triple transgenic mouse model enabled us to further analyze the role of BDNF in AD in vivo. We reasoned that in case BDNF has a protective effect against AD pathology, an AD-like phenotype in our new mouse model should occur earlier and/or in more severity than in the APP/PS1-mice. Indeed, the behavioral analysis revealed that the APP/PS1-BDNF(+/-)-mice show an earlier onset of learning impairments in a two-way active avoidance task in comparison to APP/PS1- and BDNF(+/-)-mice. However in the Morris water maze (MWM) test, we could not observe an overall aggrevated impairment in spatial learning and also short-term memory in an object recognition task remained intact in all tested mouse lines. In addition to the behavioral experiments, we analyzed the amyloid plaque pathology in the APP/PS1 and APP/PS1-BDNF(+/-)-mice and observed a comparable plaque density in the two genotypes. Moreover, our results revealed a higher plaque density in prefrontal cortical compared to hippocampal brain regions. Our data reveal that higher cognitive tasks requiring the recruitment of cortical networks appear to be more severely affected in our new mouse model than learning tasks requiring mainly sub-cortical networks. Furthermore, our observations of an accelerated impairment in active avoidance learning in APP/PS1-BDNF(+/-)-mice further supports the hypothesis that BDNF deficiency amplifies AD-related cognitive dysfunctions."

Critical assessment indicates that most of them do not yet take full advantage of virtual environments with high levels of immersion and interaction. Many still rely on conventional 2D graphic displays to create non-immersive or semi-immersive VR scenarios. Important improvements are needed to make VR a better and more versatile assessment and training tool for AD. The use of the latest display technologies available, such as emerging head-mounted displays and 3D smart TV technologies, together with realistic multi-sensorial interaction devices, and neuro-physiological feedback capacity, are some of the most beneficial improvements this mini-review suggests.

Although a few studies showed that culture influences cognitive strategies [6-13], the interaction between these factors has never been globally assessed as this requires testing millions of people of all ages across many different countries in the world. Since countries vary in their geographical and cultural properties, we predicted that these variations give rise to an organized spatial distribution of cognition at a planetary-wide scale. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mobile-app-based cognitive task, measuring non-verbal spatial navigation ability in more than 2.5 million people and sampling populations in every nation state. We focused on spatial navigation due to its universal requirement across cultures. Using a clustering approach, we find that navigation ability is clustered into five distinct, yet geographically related, groups of countries. Specifically, the economic wealth of a nation was predictive of the average navigation ability of its inhabitants, and gender inequality was predictive of the size of performance difference between males and females. Thus, cognitive abilities, at least for spatial navigation, are clustered according to economic wealth and gender inequalities globally, which has significant implications for cross-cultural studies and multi-center clinical trials using cognitive testing."

In context, developing evidence suggest that Aβ decreases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mostly by lowering phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) protein. In fact, it has been observed that brain or serum levels of BDNF appear to be beneficial markers for cognitive condition.

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Spatial disorientation is common in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and preclinical individuals with AD biomarkers. However, traditional neuropsychological tests lack ecological validity for the assessment of spatial orientation and to date, there is still no gold standard. The current study aimed to determine the validity and accuracy of two virtual reality tasks for the assessment of spatial orientation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We adapted two spatial orientation tasks to immersive virtual environments: a \"survey to route\" task in which participants had to transfer information from a map to their body position within a maze [Spatial Orientation in Immersive Virtual Environment Test (SOIVET) Maze], and an allocentric-type, route learning task, with well-established topographic landmarks (SOIVET Route). A total of 19 MCI patients and 29 cognitively healthy older adults aged 61-92 participated in this study. Regular neuropsychological assessments were used for correlation analysis and participant performances were compared between groups. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for accuracy.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The SOIVET Maze correlated with measures of visuoperception, mental rotation, and planning, and was not related to age, educational level, or technology use profile. The SOIVET Route immediate correlated with measures of mental rotation, memory, and visuoconstruction, and was influenced only by education. Both tasks significantly differentiated MCI and control groups, and demonstrated moderate accuracy for the MCI diagnosis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Traditional neuropsychological assessment presents limitations and immersive environments allow for the reproduction of complex cognitive processes. The two immersive virtual reality tasks are valid tools for the assessment of spatial orientation and should be considered for cognitive assessments of older adults."

Pharmacological treatments did not demonstrate any effect on cognition compared with cognitive rehabilitation (CR). However, if CR programs offer promising results on cognition, they are less consistent concerning mood and quality of life (QoL). In this context, we designed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative computerized CR program, conducted at home, on QoL. Secondary objectives will estimate the improvement, or the stabilization over time, of patients' cognitive performances and their emotional affects.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Forty MS patients (relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive forms) who have cognitive impairment will be recruited for the trial (called SEPIA-NCT03471338) and randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. Patients randomly assigned in the experimental group will perform a home-based CR program with psychological support during eight consecutive weeks. CR will be based on computerized cognitive exercises from the PRESCO® software developed by HAPPYneuron©. Training sessions (three sessions of 45 min per week) will consist of short exercises evaluating a broad range of cognitive domains and will be personalized for each patient (tracking tool and supervised guidance). The control group, designed to control for non-specific elements of the intervention, will receive only psychological support consisting of various issues related to MS, such as everyday cognitive-related difficulties or management of emotions. QoL, assessed by the MUSIQOL (Multiple Sclerosis International Quality Of Life) questionnaire, will be evaluated three times (at baseline and after 1 week and 25 weeks after home-based intervention) as well as secondary outcomes measuring self-esteem, cognition, depression, anxiety, metacognition, fatigue, and sleep quality.

Virtual reality is an expanding tool, which enables on one hand the assessment of the cognitive functions involved in spatial navigation, and on the other the rehabilitation of patients with spatial navigation difficulties. Topographical disorientation is a frequent deficit among patients suffering from neurological diseases. The use of virtual environments enables the information incorporated into the virtual environment to be manipulated empirically.

            "abstract": "Background: Psychophysiological changes are part of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology and can signal emotional engagement during psychological treatment. Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore psychophysiological responses during multi-modular motion-assisted memory desensitization and reconsolidation (3MDR) therapy. Increased self-reported distress, substantially increased heart rate (HR) and breathing rate (BR) were expected at the start of therapy and predicted to improve over time. Since physical exercise demands during therapy were low, any large HR or BR responses were considered part of the psychophysiological response. Methods: This study used pooled data collected during a randomized controlled trial of 3MDR, which demonstrated significant improvement as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale. Whilst attending therapy, HR and BR data, subjective units of distress (SUD) score and phrases to describe feelings whilst exposed to trauma-related images were collected continuously from 37 UK male military veterans with PTSD. Results: HR and BR were significantly increased throughout all sessions (p < .01 for both). Whilst HR was raised slightly remaining on average below 100 beats/minute, BR was increased substantially with average values between 40 and 50 breaths/minute. SUD scores were very high during therapy which concurred with the many negative feelings experienced during therapy sessions. Across the course of the treatment, SUD scores (p < .01) and negative feelings were reduced (p < .001), and positive feelings have increased (p < .01) significantly, reflecting improvements in clinicians assessed PTSD symptoms. Across therapy sessions, HR (p = .888) and BR (p = .466) responses did not change. Conclusions: The strong psychophysiological response alongside high levels of self-reported distress and negative feelings is interpreted as high emotional engagement during therapy. A novel finding was the very significant BR increase throughout recorded sessions. Future PTSD research should include BR response to therapy and explore breathing control as a treatment target."

            "abstract": "Accelerated forgetting has been identified as a feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the therapeutic efficacy of the manipulation of biological mechanisms of forgetting has not been assessed in AD animal models. Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), a small GTPase, has been shown to regulate active forgetting in Drosophila and mice. Here, we showed that Rac1 activity is aberrantly elevated in the hippocampal tissues of AD patients and AD animal models. Moreover, amyloid-beta 42 could induce Rac1 activation in cultured cells. The elevation of Rac1 activity not only accelerated 6-hour spatial memory decay in 3-month-old APP/PS1 mice, but also significantly contributed to severe memory loss in aged APP/PS1 mice. A similar age-dependent Rac1 activity-based memory loss was also observed in an AD fly model. Moreover, inhibition of Rac1 activity could ameliorate cognitive defects and synaptic plasticity in AD animal models. Finally, two novel compounds, identified through behavioral screening of a randomly selected pool of brain permeable small molecules for their positive effect in rescuing memory loss in both fly and mouse models, were found to be capable of inhibiting Rac1 activity. Thus, multiple lines of evidence corroborate in supporting the idea that inhibition of Rac1 activity is effective for treating AD-related memory loss."

Virtual reality environments have a major advantage for the assessment of spatial navigation and memory formation, as computer-simulated first-person environments can simulate navigation in a large-scale space. However, virtual reality studies on allocentric memory in subjects with cortical lesions are rare, and studies on egocentric memory are lacking. Twenty-four subjects with unilateral parietal cortex lesions due to infarction or intracerebral haemorrhage (14 left-sided, 10 right-sided) were compared with 36 healthy matched control subjects on two virtual reality tasks affording to learn a virtual park (allocentric memory) and a virtual maze (egocentric memory). Subjects further received a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological investigation, and MRI lesion assessment using T(1), T(2) and FLAIR sequences as well as 3D MRI volumetry at the time of the assessment. Results indicate that left- and right-sided lesioned subjects did not differ on task performance. Compared with control subjects, subjects with parietal cortex lesions were strongly impaired learning the virtual maze. On the other hand, performance of subjects with parietal cortex lesions on the virtual park was entirely normal. Volumes of the right-sided precuneus of lesioned subjects were significantly related to performance on the virtual maze, indicating better performance of subjects with larger volumes. It is concluded that parietal cortices support egocentric navigation and imagination during spatial learning in large-scale environments."

However, the optimal choice of non-pharmacological therapies for post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is still unclear.

However, such path integration changes have been less explored in Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI), despite neurovascular change being a major contributing factor to dementia and potentially AD. In particular, the sensitivity and specificity of path integration impairments in VCI compared to AD is unclear. In the current pilot study, we explore path integration performance in early-stage AD and VCI patient groups and hypothesize that: (i) medial parietal mediated egocentric processes will be more affected in VCI; and (ii) medial temporal mediated allocentric processes will be more affected in AD. This cross-sectional study included early-stage VCI patients (n = 9), AD patients (n = 10) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 20). All participants underwent extensive neuropsychological testing, as well as spatial navigation testing. The spatial navigation tests included the virtual reality \"Supermarket\" task assessing egocentric (body-based) and allocentric (map-based) navigation as well as the \"Clock Orientation\" test assessing egocentric and path integration processes. Results showed that egocentric integration processes are only impaired in VCI, potentially distinguishing it from AD. However, in contrast to our prediction, allocentric integration was not more impaired in AD compared to VCI. These preliminary findings suggest limited specificity of allocentric integration deficits between VCI and AD. By contrast, egocentric path integration deficits emerge as more specific to VCI, potentially allowing for more specific diagnostic and treatment outcome measures for vascular impairment in dementia."

            "abstract": "Several mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with abundant β-amyloid and/or aberrantly phosphorylated tau develop memory impairments. However, multiple non-mnemonic cognitive domains such as attention and executive control are also compromised early in AD individuals. Currently, it is unclear whether mutations in the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau are sufficient to cause similar, AD-like attention deficits in mouse models of the disease. To address this question, we tested 3xTgAD mice (which express APPswe, PS1M146V, and tauP301L mutations) and wild-type control mice on a newly developed touchscreen-based 5-choice serial reaction time test of attention and response control. The 3xTgAD mice attended less accurately to short, spatially unpredictable stimuli when the attentional demand of the task was high, and also showed a general tendency to make more perseverative responses than wild-type mice. The attentional impairment of 3xTgAD mice was comparable to that of AD patients in two aspects: first, although 3xTgAD mice initially responded as accurately as wild-type mice, they subsequently failed to sustain their attention over the duration of the task; second, the ability to sustain attention was enhanced by the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil (Aricept). These findings demonstrate that familial AD mutations not only affect memory, but also cause significant impairments in attention, a cognitive domain supported by the prefrontal cortex and its afferents. Because attention deficits are likely to affect memory encoding and other cognitive abilities, our findings have important consequences for the assessment of disease mechanisms and therapeutics in animal models of AD."

Executive function, which seems to play a key role in dual-task gait performance, can be improved by combined physical and cognitive training. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to assist rehabilitation, and its effect on physical and cognitive function requires further investigation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of VR-based physical and cognitive training on executive function and dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, as well as to compare VR-based physical and cognitive training with traditional combined physical and cognitive training. Method: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomly assigned into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined traditional physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Outcome measures included executive function [Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) and trail making test (TMT) A and B], gait performance (gait speed, stride length, and cadence) and dual-task costs (DTCs). Walking tasks were performed during single-task walking, walking while performing serial subtraction (cognitive dual task), and walking while carrying a tray (motor dual task). The GAIT Up system was used to evaluate gait parameters including speed, stride length, cadence and DTCs. DTC were defined as 100 * (single-task gait parameters - dual-task gait parameters)/single-task gait parameters. Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in the SCWT and single-task and motor dual-task gait performance measures. However, only the VR group showed improvements in cognitive dual-task gait performance and the DTC of cadence. Moreover, the VR group showed more improvements than the CPC group in the TMT-B and DTC of cadence with borderline significances. Conclusion: A 12-week VR-based physical and cognitive training program led to significant improvements in dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, which may be attributed to improvements in executive function."

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, resulting in progressive neuronal death and debilitating damage to brain loci that mediate memory and higher cognitive function. While pathogenic genetic mutations have been implicated in approximately 2% of AD cases, the proximal events that underlie the common, sporadic form of the disease are incompletely understood. Converging lines of evidence from human neuropathology, basic biology, and genetics have implicated loss of the multifunctional receptor LR11 (also known as SORLA and SORL1) in AD pathogenesis. Cell-based studies suggest that LR11 reduces the formation of beta-amyloid (Abeta), the molecule believed to be a primary toxic species in AD. Recently, mutant mice deficient in LR11 were shown to upregulate murine Abeta in mouse brain. In the current study, LR11-deficient mice were crossed with transgenic mice expressing autosomal-dominant human AD genes, presenilin-1 (PS1DeltaE9) and amyloid precursor protein (APPswe). Here, we show that LR11 deficiency in this AD mouse model significantly increases Abeta levels and exacerbates early amyloid pathology in brain, causing a forward shift in disease onset that is LR11 gene dose-dependent. Loss of LR11 increases the processing of the APP holo-molecule into alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretase derived metabolites. We propose that LR11 regulates APP processing and Abeta accumulation in vivo and is of proximal importance to the cascade of pathological amyloidosis. The results of the current study support the hypothesis that control of LR11 expression may exert critical effects on Alzheimer's disease susceptibility in humans."

In addition, among the top results of our genome-wide association study, we discovered a novel variant near the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP, rs2829887) that is associated with neuritic plaques (P = 3.3 × 10-6). This polymorphism was associated with postmortem β-amyloid load as well as fibrillar β-amyloid in 2 independent cohorts of adults with normal cognition.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      These findings enhance understanding of AD risk factors by relating validated susceptibility alleles to increased neuritic plaque pathology and implicate common genetic variation at the APP locus in the earliest, presymptomatic stages of AD."

            "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) technologies have shown promising potential in the early diagnosis of dementia by enabling accessible and regular assessment. However, previous VR studies were restricted to the analysis of behavioral responses, so information about degenerated brain dynamics could not be directly acquired. To address this issue, we provide a cognitive impairment (CI) screening tool based on a wearable EEG device integrated into a VR platform. Subjects were asked to use a hardware setup consisting of a frontal six-channel EEG device mounted on a VR device and to perform four cognitive tasks in VR. Behavioral response profiles and EEG features were extracted during the tasks, and classifiers were trained on extracted features to differentiate subjects with CI from healthy controls (HCs). Notably, the performance of the patient classification consistently improved when EEG characteristics measured during cognitive tasks were additionally included in feature attributes than when only the task scores or resting-state EEG features were used, suggesting that our protocol provides discriminative information for screening. These results propose that the integration of EEG devices into a VR framework could emerge as a powerful and synergistic strategy for constructing an easily accessible EEG-based CI screening tool."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study is to assess the effect of tramadol use on cognitive functions, especially executive functions. Thirty tramadol use disorder patients were recruited from those admitted to the toxicology departments of Menoufia University Hospitals for detoxification. Thirty controls were recruited from employees working at the faculty of medicine, Menoufia University. Both patients and controls underwent a demographic sheet and computerized cognitive battery. Patients also completed another sheet about substance use history. Urine screening for drugs was performed on all patients prior to admission. No differences regarding age, education or marital status were found between patients and controls. Tramadol-dependent patients showed cognitive impairment in the form of impaired visual-spatial memory and executive functions in comparison to controls. After detoxification, patients showed improvement regarding executive functions but not visual-spatial memory. Tramadol impairs cognitive functions in tramadol-dependent patients."

            "abstract": "Due to the growing number of older adults with cognitive impairment, it is essential to delay the onset and progression of cognitive decline and promote a healthy lifestyle. The rapid growth of technology has considerably advanced the field of computerized cognitive interventions. Consequently, traditional cognitive interventions are being adapted and new multimedia systems are being developed to encourage health and independent living in old age. The primary objective of this review was to identify cognitive stimulation, training and rehabilitation programs aimed at older people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, PubMed, and CORDIS databases were searched from January 2008 to August 2018. Two researchers reviewed the potential studies individually for eligibility. Studies of computerized cognitive interventions for people with dementia and cognitive impairment were included if they clearly described objectives, users and functioning. A systematic review of the studies was carried out, providing a qualitative synthesis of the features and study characteristics of each software. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria, and 11 different cognitive stimulation, training, and rehabilitation programs were identified. The studies found on cognitive intervention software indicate the existence of various technological programs for people with MCI and dementia. On the overall, the programs were aimed at people with different clinical conditions, able to create specific treatments and personalized training, optimized for portable devices, and user-friendly. However, the selected programs differ from each other in terms of objectives, usage mode and characteristics, even if they were used for the same purposes. Therefore, the information obtained in the review may be relevant to distinguish between programs and select the one that best suits each user. Thus, more information about the features and context of use is needed as well as more clinical studies to be able to compare among computerized cognitive programs."

We present a case study of a traumatic brain injury subject in whom eight sessions of a neuropsychological rehabilitation protocol targeting attention, executive functions, and working memory as compared with a personalized EEG-based neurofeedback protocol focused on the electrodes and bands that differed from healthy subjects (F3, F1, Fz, FC3, FC1, and FCz), targeting the inhibition of theta frequency band (3 Hz-7 Hz) in the same number of sessions. Quantitative EEG and neuropsychological testing were performed. Clear benefits of EEG-based neurofeedback were found in divided and sustained attention and several aspects related to visuospatial skills and the processing speed of motor-dependent tasks.

Am80 was orally administered in feed to 20-week (5-month)-old APP23 mice at a dose of 0 (control) or 0.5 mg/kg/d for 14 weeks. The Am80 treatment reduced significantly the insoluble Abeta levels in brain, in particular Abeta(42), while it gave no apparent effects on the soluble Abeta levels. The results suggest that oral administration of Am80 may have potency to reduce the extracellular Abeta(42) of insoluble and possibly oligomeric or protofibril forms, which are related to the cause and/or progression of Alzheimer's disease. The Am80 treatment showed no significant effect on spatial learning and memory of APP23 mice by Morris water maze analysis. The main reason for the absence of significance seems based on the large deviation and some mice both in the treated and the non-treated groups would neither swim nor make efforts to reach the platform."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem with neurobehavioral sequelae contributing to the long-term disability that is often associated with the moderate to severe levels of injury. Rehabilitation of cognitive skills is central to encouraging the full participation of the individual in home, vocational, and social roles. The review of available evidence points to four major recommendations for the rehabilitation of cognition following brain injury: 1) Access to subacute rehabilitation that is holistic in nature and involves a multidisciplinary or transdisciplinary team to work in an integrated fashion to support physical, cognitive, and social skill retraining is vital to support positive outcome following TBI. The collaborative effort of these individuals allows for continual reinforcement and evaluation of treatment goals and will often involve the family and/or important others in the individual's life to prepare for community re-entry. 2) Trials of medication, especially methylphenidate, to assist individuals with significant attention and memory impairment appear well supported by the available evidence. Though some data suggest that the use of cholinesterase inhibitors may be of use for individuals with memory impairments, there is less support for this practice and there are indications that it may worsen the behavioral sequelae of the injury. 3) Randomized controlled trials demonstrate the utility of specific rehabilitation approaches to attention retraining and retraining of executive functioning skills. Future research is needed on rehabilitation techniques in other domains of cognition. 4) Training in the use of supportive devices (either a memory book or more technologically enhanced compensatory devices) to support the individual's daily activities remains central to the independent function of the individual in the community. Though emerging treatments (eg, virtual reality environments) show relative degrees of promise for inclusion in the rehabilitation of the individual with TBI, these need further evaluation in systematic trials."

Recently, we described a high incidence of inter-individual regional heterogeneity in terms of asymmetry of plaque burden and microglial activation in β-amyloid mouse models of AD as assessed by positron-emission-tomography (PET). We now investigate the regional associations between amyloid plaque burden, microglial activation, and impaired spatial learning performance in transgenic mice in vivo.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In 30 AppNL-G-F mice (15 female, 15 male) we acquired cross-sectional 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO-PET, 18F-GE-180) and β-amyloid-PET (18F-florbetaben) scans at ten months of age.

We assessed spatial learning (i.e. Morris water maze) within two weeks of PET scanning and correlated the principal component of spatial learning performance scores with voxel-wise β-amyloid and TSPO tracer uptake maps in AppNL-G-F mice, controlled for age and sex. In order to assess the effects of hemispheric asymmetry, we also analyzed correlations of spatial learning performance with tracer uptake in bilateral regions of interest for frontal cortex, entorhinal/piriform cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, using a regression model.

Region-based analysis showed significant correlations between TSPO expression in the right entorhinal/piriform cortex and the right amygdala and spatial learning performance, whereas there were no such correlations in the left hemisphere. Right lateralized TSPO expression in the amygdala predicted better performance in the Morris water maze (β = -0.470, p = 0.013), irrespective of the global microglial activation and amyloid level.

Lower volumes among patients with PD compared to unaffected participants were detected in bilateral hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, caudate, thalamus, putamen and amygdala and the right pallidum (p = 0.016). PD patients demonstrated lower cortical thickness indexes in a majority of regions assessed compared with non-manifesting participants. No differences in cortical thickness and subcortical volumes were detected within each of the groups of participants based on genetic status. Mutations in the GBA and LRRK2 genes are not important determinants of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in both patients with PD and non-manifesting participants.

            "abstract": "Transgenic (Tg) mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are used to investigate mechanisms underlying disease pathology and identify therapeutic strategies. Most Tg AD models, which at least partly recapitulate the AD phenotype, are based on insertion of one or more human mutations (identified in Familial AD) into the mouse genome, with the notable exception of the anti-NGF mouse, which is based on the cholinergic unbalance hypothesis. It has recently emerged that impaired hippocampal synaptic function is an early detectable pathological alteration, well before the advanced stage of amyloid plaque accumulation and general cell death. Nevertheless, electrophysiological studies performed on different Tg models or on the same model by different research groups have yielded contrasting results. We therefore summarized data from original research papers studying hippocampal synaptic function using electrophysiology, to review what we have learned so far. We analyzed results obtained using the following Tg models: (1) single/multiple APP mutations; (2) single presenilin (PS) mutations; (3) APPxPS1 mutations; (4) APPxPS1xtau mutations (3xTg); and (5) anti-NGF expressing (AD11) mice. We observed that the majority of papers focus on excitatory basic transmission and long-term potentiation, while few studies evaluate inhibitory transmission and long-term depression. We searched for common synaptic alterations in the various models that might underlie the memory deficits observed in these mice. We also considered experimental variables that could explain differences in the reported results and briefly discuss successful rescue strategies. These analyses should prove useful for future design of electrophysiology experiments to assess hippocampal function in AD mouse models."

We therefore suggest more standardized study protocols in order to maximize comparability of studies and to maximize the possibility of data pooling - also in other cognitive domains than memory."

Although cognitive impairment (CI) is increasingly considered the main geriatric condition predisposing to dementia, its early management could still promote symptomatic relief and delay disease progression. Recently, probiotics treatment has been studied as a potential new therapeutic approach to attenuate dementia-related decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to review and analyse the available evidence on the effect of probiotics on MCI and dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic search and meta-analysis were performed on Cochrane Library, ProQuest, Web of Science, PubMed-Medline, The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, ScienceDirect and Open Grey. Search terms included diagnoses of interest (dementia and MCI) and the intervention of interest (probiotic, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium). Original articles reporting the use of probiotics supplementation for the treatment of dementia and MCI were screened and studied independently by two researchers. After that, a random and fixed effects model was used at the meta-analysis stage of the results to determine its effect size.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 16 articles (10 preclinical and 6 clinical) that met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review, and 15 articles (10 preclinical and 5 clinical) for meta-analysis were finally included. In humans, the administration of probiotics improved general cognitive function after the treatment period. Similarly, an improvement in memory and spatial/non-spatial learning was identified in the probiotic group of animals compared to the control group. On the other hand, the results showed an increase in the levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, an improvement in the inflammatory profile and regulation of cellular biomarkers after probiotics administration.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Probiotics supplementation could be an adequate therapeutic strategy both in dementia and CI based on clinical and preclinical evidence.

However, the use of commercially available digital cognitive tests is not common in Hong Kong, which may be due to the high cost of the tests and the language barrier. Thus, we developed a brief and user-friendly digital cognitive test called the Electronic Cognitive Screen (EC-Screen) for the detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia of older adults.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the EC-Screen for the detection of MCI and dementia in older adults.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The EC-Screen is a brief digital cognitive test that has been adapted from the Rapid Cognitive Screen test.

The outcomes were the performance of the EC-Screen in distinguishing participants with MCI and dementia from controls, and in distinguishing participants with dementia from those with MCI and controls. The cohort was randomly split into derivation and validation cohorts based on the participants' disease group. In the derivation cohort, the regression-derived score of the EC-Screen was calculated using binomial logistic regression. Two predictive models were produced. The first model was used to distinguish participants with MCI and dementia from controls, and the second model was used to distinguish participants with dementia from those with MCI and controls. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed and the areas under the curves (AUCs) were calculated. The performances of the two predictive models were tested using the validation cohorts. The relationship between the EC-Screen and paper-and-pencil Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Hong Kong version (HK-MoCA) was evaluated by the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 126 controls, 54 participants with MCI, and 63 participants with dementia were included in the study.

One therapeutic strategy is to decrease the production of potentially toxic beta-amyloid species by the use of inhibitors or modulators of the enzymes that produce beta-amyloid from amyloid precursor protein (APP). The failures of several such drug candidates by lack of effect or undesired side-effects underscore the importance to monitor the drug effects in the brain on a molecular level.

Moreover, loss of DAPK1 expression has correlated strongly with tumor recurrence and metastasis, suggesting that lack of sufficient functional DAPK1 might contribute to cancer. In contrast, DAPK1 is highly expressed in the brains of most human AD patients and has been identified as one of the genetic factors affecting susceptibility to late-onset AD.

Four computerized and three non-computerized memory tests, a naming test, and a test of visuo-motor speed were administered twice. Two estimates of intellectual capacity were made, one at the first examination and the other 3 1/2 years later. One person in the AAMI group (n = 44) developed vascular dementia. The group of AAMI subjects did less well on two of the seven memory tests after 3 1/2 years than they did initially; the control group (n = 18) had lower scores on one memory test at follow-up than they had previously. The data suggest that the memory capacity of subjects with AAMI is not pathologically impaired. The general intellectual level significantly influences whether an individual with memory complaints will be classified AAMI or not. People with high intelligence are less likely than people with lower intellectual capacity to fulfill the AAMI criteria. This suggests that AAMI lacks in construct validity."

Initial evidence suggests that techniques incorporating motivational strategies to enhance treatment engagement may provide more benefit than computerised training alone. Seventy four adults with subclinical cognitive decline were randomly assigned to computerised cognitive training (CCT), Cognitive Vitality Training (CVT), or an Active Control Group (ACG), and underwent neuropsychological evaluations at baseline and four-month follow-up. Significant differences were found in changes in performance on the Modified Mini Mental State Examination (mMMSE) and measures of verbal learning and memory across treatment groups. Experimental groups showed greater preservation of functioning on the mMMSE than the ACG group, the CVT group performed better than the ACG group on one measure of verbal learning and both measures of verbal memory, and the CCT group performed better than the ACG group on one measure of verbal learning and one measure of verbal memory. There were no significant group differences between the CVT and CCT groups on measures of verbal learning or memory. It was concluded that computerised cognitive training may offer the most benefit when incorporated into a therapeutic milieu rather than administered alone, although both appear superior to more generic forms of cognitive stimulation."

Although glutamate modulators may be effective in reversing such difficult-to-treat conditions, the results of individual studies thus far have been inconsistent. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine whether glutamate positive modulators have beneficial effects on cognitive functions in patients with schizophrenia. A literature search was conducted to identify double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials in schizophrenia or related disorders, using Embase, Medline, and PsycINFO (last search: February 2015). The effects of glutamate positive modulators on cognitive deficits were evaluated for overall cognitive function and eight cognitive domains by calculating standardized mean differences (SMDs) between active drugs and placebo added to antipsychotics. Seventeen studies (N=1391) were included. Glutamate positive modulators were not superior to placebo in terms of overall cognitive function (SMD=0.08, 95% confidence interval=-0.06 to 0.23) (11 studies, n=858) nor each of eight cognitive domains (SMDs=-0.03 to 0.11) (n=367-940) in this population. Subgroup analyses by diagnosis (schizophrenia only studies), concomitant antipsychotics, or pathway of drugs to enhance the glutamatergic neurotransmission (glycine allosteric site of NMDA receptors or α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors) suggested no procognitive effect of glutamate positive modulators. Further, no effect was found in individual compounds on cognition. In conclusion, glutamate positive modulators may not be effective in reversing overall cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia as adjunctive therapies."

More extensive imaging or cerebrospinal fluid studies represent significant barriers due to cost and burden. We combined functional connectivity and graph theoretical measures, derived from resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, with computerized cognitive testing to identify differences between persons with MCI and healthy controls based on a sample of community-dwelling African American elders. We found a significant decrease in functional connectivity and a less integrated graph topology in persons with MCI. A combination of functional connectivity, topological and cognition measurements is powerful for prediction of MCI and combined measures are clearly more effective for prediction than using a single approach. Specifically, by combining cognition features with functional connectivity and topological features the prediction improved compared with the classification using features from single cognitive or EEG domains, with an accuracy of 86.5%, compared with the accuracy of 77.5% of the best single approach. Community-dwelling African American elders find EEG and computerized testing acceptable and results are promising in terms of differentiating between healthy controls and persons with MCI living in the community."

            "abstract": "The extracellular deposition of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in the form of cerebrovascular amyloid and extracellular plaques is one of the major neuropathological manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is generated proteolytically from the large beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is cleaved by a group of proteases called \"secretase\" to generate soluble derivatives of APP (sAPP), which are secreted in human plasma, CSF and cultured cells. Neurochemically, there is a severe loss of cholinergic neurons and a decreased synthesis of acetylcholine in neocortex in AD. Current approved AD drugs, such as aricept and tacrine, are based on the use of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and have been reported to improve memory deficits and cognitive decline in some patients with AD. To compare the effects of ChEIs on APP processing, we have tested a series of ChEIs such as tacrine, physostigmine, metrifonate, phenserine and cymserine in cultured human neuroblastoma cells. We analyzed levels of sAPP by immunochemical techniques with APP-specific antibodies and assayed levels of Abeta by a sensitive sandwich ELISA. Based on these results, ChEIs can be divided into three groups: the first group of ChEIs had no effect on sAPP secretion, the second decreased the sAPP secretion only, and third group affected the secretion of sAPP and Abeta. The difference in the action of metrifonate, physostigmine, phenserine and tacrine on APP processing is independent of their selectivity for the cholinesterase enzymes. This possibly is due to the different targets that are used by ChEIs. Studying the effects of ChEIs on different targets is useful to maximize the benefit of ChEIs for the treatment of AD subjects."

Although there are currently no definitive standard therapies for the treatment of apathy, nonpharmacological treatment (NPT) is often considered to be at the forefront of clinical management.

Furthermore, although new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are beginning to be employed in NPT, their role is still unclear.

The expert panel included 20 researchers and healthcare professionals working on brain disorders and apathy. Following a standard Delphi methodology, experts answered questions via several rounds of web-surveys, and then discussed the results in a plenary meeting. The experts suggested that NPT are useful to consider as therapy for people presenting with different neurocognitive and psychiatric diseases at all stages, with evidence of apathy across domains. The presence of a therapist and/or a caregiver is important in delivering NPT effectively, but parts of the treatment may be performed by the patient alone. NPT can be delivered both in clinical settings and at home.

This makes it difficult to compare results between groups and to create normative data sets for any specific navigational task. Such norms, however, are prerequisites for the use of navigation assessments as diagnostic tools-for example, to support the early and differential diagnosis of atypical aging. Here we start addressing these problems by presenting and evaluating a new navigation test suite that we make freely available to other researchers (https://osf.io/mx52y/). Specifically, we designed three navigational tasks, which are adaptations of earlier published tasks used to study the effects of typical and atypical aging on navigation: a route-repetition task that can be solved using egocentric navigation strategies, and route-retracing and directional-approach tasks that both require allocentric spatial processing. Despite introducing a number of changes to the original tasks to make them look more realistic and ecologically valid, and therefore easy to explain to people unfamiliar with a VE or who have cognitive impairments, we replicated the findings from the original studies. Specifically, we found general age-related declines in navigation performance and additional specific difficulties in tasks that required allocentric processes. These findings demonstrate that our new tasks have task demands similar to those of the original tasks, and are thus suited to be used more widely."

All protocols used rodents to their experiments (100%), but mice were the most common (62.5%). Finally, the main results presented in all studies were capable to reduce significantly AD consequences, such as reducing Aβ or pro-inflammatory proteins levels (100%).

            "abstract": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment or learning difficulties in HIV-infected children is high despite access to antiretroviral treatment (ART). Several biological mechanisms, including latent HIV reservoir persistence in the brain, local inflammation within the central nervous system (CNS), disruption of neuronal function and integrity, and ongoing infiltration of activated HIV target cells to the CNS during brain development, may each dampen efficacy of ART. Development of therapeutics to target these mechanisms will be crucial, and potential candidates may include chemokine receptor antagonists. Separately, psychosocial approaches to support caregiving may leverage neuroplasticity and support brain development during critical developmental windows in spite of perinatal HIV infection. Multipronged approaches that encompass both approaches are crucial for optimizing neurodevelopmental outcomes in these extraordinarily vulnerable children. Dynamic neuropsychological assessments, such as what can be obtained with the use of computerized cognitive games intervention, may prove more sensitive to the brain/behavior benefits of ART. Dynamic neuropsychological outcomes, neuroinflammatory biomarkers, and brain development neuroprotective factors (BDNFs) may each be used to evaluate brain/behavior integrity of children in response to new treatment options."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Cognitive and mood disorders negatively impact daily life in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Pharmacological treatments did not demonstrate any effect on cognition compared with cognitive rehabilitation (CR). However, if CR programs offer promising results on cognition, they are less consistent concerning mood and quality of life (QoL). In this context, we designed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative computerized CR program, conducted at home, on QoL. Secondary objectives will estimate the improvement, or the stabilization over time, of patients' cognitive performances and their emotional affects.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Forty MS patients (relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive forms) who have cognitive impairment will be recruited for the trial (called SEPIA-NCT03471338) and randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. Patients randomly assigned in the experimental group will perform a home-based CR program with psychological support during eight consecutive weeks. CR will be based on computerized cognitive exercises from the PRESCO® software developed by HAPPYneuron©. Training sessions (three sessions of 45 min per week) will consist of short exercises evaluating a broad range of cognitive domains and will be personalized for each patient (tracking tool and supervised guidance). The control group, designed to control for non-specific elements of the intervention, will receive only psychological support consisting of various issues related to MS, such as everyday cognitive-related difficulties or management of emotions. QoL, assessed by the MUSIQOL (Multiple Sclerosis International Quality Of Life) questionnaire, will be evaluated three times (at baseline and after 1 week and 25 weeks after home-based intervention) as well as secondary outcomes measuring self-esteem, cognition, depression, anxiety, metacognition, fatigue, and sleep quality. Given the expected MUSIQOL variation, the inclusion of 20 patients per group (alpha risk 5% and power 80%) will be required.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Evidence suggests that computerized programs may be a practice option for CR for people with MS, but there is a paucity of studies evaluating QoL. We hope that this innovative program will highlight such benefits over time in patients' daily life. In the future, such programs will allow a wider range of available therapeutic options for MS patients with cognitive impairment and for practitioners in charge of their care.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03471338.

This study aims to investigate whether QKR improves the cognitive ability and takes neuroprotective effect on APP/PS1 double transgenic mice via the PI3K/Akt pathway. APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were randomly divided into a model, donepezil-treated, or QKR-treated group (L-QKR: 4.75 mg/kg/d, M-QKR: 9.5 mg/kg/d, and H-QKR: 19 mg/kg/d, respectively). Wild-type C57/BL6J mice were used as the control group. Morris water maze (MWM) was used to test the ability of spatial navigation and memorization; terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) assay was applied to test the apoptosis; amyloid protein granule deposition was detected via Methenamine silver staining; Western blot (WB) analysis, immunohistochemistry, and RT-PCR were applied to measure the expression of Aβ and corresponding indicators of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Compared with the model group, QKR significantly relieved the cognitive impairment, reduced the deposition of senile plaques, decreased the expression of GSK-3α and Aβ, and increased the expression of p-PI3K, p-Akt, and IDE. In addition, the number of TUNEL-positive cells decreased after treatment using QKR. The current study proved that QKR, especially at the high dose tested, exerted a protective effect on improving learning and memory, inhibiting apoptosis, and reducing the process of pathological degeneration in the hippocampus of AD mice."

This study investigated the effects of dual-task training on executive function and activity in the PFC of older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Thirty-six older adults with MCI randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG) performing cognitive-physical dual-task training requiring for simultaneous cognitive tasks and physical exercise (n = 18) or the control group (CG) receiving sing-cognitive training using the computerized cognitive training program focusing on executive function (n = 18) for 16 sessions lasting 40 minutes a session. For the primary outcomes, the Trail Making Test Part B (TMT-B) was used, and for the secondary outcome, activity in the PFC using functional near infrared spectroscopy and the Korean version of instrumental activities of daily living (K-IADL) were evaluated at pre-and post-intervention. After the intervention, the EG achieved a significantly higher improvement in the TMT-B and decreased activity in the PFC during TMT-B testing than the CG. However, there were no significant differences in the K-IADL in both groups. These findings indicate that dual-task training is more effective in improving executive process and decreasing activity in the PFC during cognitive testing than single-cognitive training with limitations of its transfer effect to daily life."

At the same time, advances in information and sensor technologies have reduced caring costs, providing a potential pathway for developing healthcare services for AD patients. For instance, if a virtual reality (VR) system can provide emotion-adaptive content, the time that AD patients spend interacting with VR content is expected to be extended, allowing caregivers to focus on other tasks. As the first step towards this goal, in this study, we develop a classification model that detects AD patients' emotions (e.g., happy, peaceful, or bored). We first collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from 30 Korean female AD patients who watched emotion-evoking videos at a medical rehabilitation center. We applied conventional machine learning algorithms, such as a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine, along with deep learning models of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures. The best performance was obtained from MLP, which achieved an average accuracy of 70.97%; the RNN model's accuracy reached only 48.18%.

A large proportion of these people will need significant help to manage various chronic illnesses, including dementia, heart disease, diabetes, limited physical movement and many others. Current approaches typically focus on acute episodes of illness and are not well designed to provide adequately for daily living care support. In our rapidly ageing society, a critical need exists for effective, affordable, scalable and safe in-home and in-residential care solutions leveraging a range of current and emerging sensor, interaction and integration technologies. Key aims are to support the ageing to live longer in their own homes; make daily challenges associated with ageing less limiting through use of technology supports; better support carers - both professional and family - in providing monitoring, proactive intervention, and community connectedness; enable in-home and in-residential care organisations to scale their support services and better use their workforces; and ultimately provide better quality of life. Deakin University researchers have been investigating a range of emerging technologies and platforms to realise this vision, which we in broad terms coin Digital Enhanced Living, in the ageing space but also supporting those with anxiety and depression, sleep disorders, various chronic diseases, recovery from injury, and various predictive analytics. A Smart Home solution, carried out in conjunction with a local start-up, has produced and trialled a novel sensor, interaction, and AI-based technology. Virtual Reality (VR) solutions have been used to support carers in the set-up of dementia-friendly homes, in conjunction with Alzheimers Australia. Activity and nutrition solutions, including the use of conversational agents, have been used to build dialogue to engage and change behaviour. Predictive analytics, in conjunction with major hospitals, have been applied to large medical datasets to better support professionals making judgements around discharge outcomes. A set of lessons have been learned from the design, deployment and trialing of these diverse solutions and new development approaches have been crafted to address the challenges faced. In particular, we found that there is a need to consider user emotional expectations as first-class citizens and create methodologies that consider the user needs during the creation of the software solutions. We find that quality and emotional aspects have to be engineered into the solution, rather than added after a technical solution is deployed."

Little suggestion of publication bias was detected.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      The study's findings suggested that T gondii seropositivity was associated with mild cognitive impairment in several cognitive domains. Although effect sizes were small, given the ubiquitous prevalence of this infection globally, the association with cognitive impairment could imply a considerable adverse effect at the population level. Further research is warranted to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this association."

Methods: Both Chinese and English databases (PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang) were used as sources of data to search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 1980 and December 2019 relating to the effects of physical activity on executive function, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and ADL issues in AD patients. Sixteen eligible RCTs were ultimately included in the meta-analysis. Results: Physical activity had significant benefits on executive function [standard mean difference (SMD) = 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22-0.62, p < 0.05], working memory (SMD = 0.28, 95% CI 0.11-0.45, p < 0.05), cognitive flexibility (SMD = 0.23, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.47, p < 0.01), and ADLs (SMD = 0.68, 95% CI 0.19-1.16, p < 0.05) among AD patients. Subgroup analysis indicated that, for executive function issues, more than 60 min per session for 16 weeks of moderate-to-high-intensity dual-task exercises or multimodal exercise had a greater effect on AD patients. For working memory and cognitive flexibility issues, 60-90 min of moderate-intensity dual-task exercises 1-4 times/week was more effective. For ADL issues, 30-90 min of multimodal exercise at 60-79% of maximal heart rate (MHR) 3-4 times/week had a greater effect on AD patients. Conclusions: Physical activity was found to lead to significant improvements in executive function, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and ADLs in AD patients and can be used as an effective method for clinical exercise intervention in these patients.

Cognitive rehabilitation is a therapeutic approach designed to improve cognitive functioning after central nervous system's injuries. Computerized cognitive rehabilitation (CCR) uses multimedia and informatics resources to optimize cognitive compromised performances. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of pc cognitive training with Erica software in patients with stroke.\n## METHODS\nWe studied 35 subjects (randomly divided into 2 groups), affected by either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, having attended from January 2013 to May 2015 the Laboratory of Robotic and Cognitive Rehabilitation of Istituto di Ricerca e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Neurolesi in Messina. Cognitive dysfunctions were investigated through a complete neuropsychological battery, administered before (T0) and after (T1) each different training.\n## RESULTS\nAt T0, all the patients showed language and cognitive deficits, especially in attention process and memory abilities, with mood alterations. After the rehabilitation program (T1), we noted a global cognitive improvement in both groups, but a more significant increase in the scores of the different clinical scales we administered was found after CCR.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur data suggest that cognitive pc training by using the Erica software may be a useful methodology to increase the post-stroke cognitive recovery.\n"

SORCS1 encodes a protein-sorting molecule genetically linked to both T2D and AD. The association of SORCS1 with both AD and T2D is sexually dimorphic in humans, with both disease associations showing more robust effects in females. Based on published evidence that manipulation of the mouse genome combining multiple genes related to cerebral amyloidosis, to T2D, or both, might provide novel mouse models with exacerbated amyloid and/or diabetes phenotypes, we assessed memory, glucose homeostasis, and brain biochemistry and pathology in male and female wild-type, Sorcs1 -/-, APP/PSEN1, and Sorcs1 -/- X APP/PSEN1 mice.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Male mice with either the APP/PSEN1 or Sorcs1 -/- genotype displayed earlier onset and persistent impairment in both learning behavior and glucose homeostasis. Unlike prior examples in the literature, the behavioral and metabolic abnormalities in male mice were not significantly exacerbated when the two disease model mice (Sorcs1 -/- models T2D; APP/PSEN1 models AD) were crossed. However, female Sorcs1 -/- X APP/PSEN1 mice exhibited worse metabolic dysfunction than Sorcs1 -/- knockout mice and worse memory than wild-type mice. The deletion of Sorcs1 from APP/PSEN1 mutant mice led to no obvious changes in brain levels of total or oligomeric amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In general, unexpectedly, there was a trend for gene targeting of Sorcs1-/- to partially mitigate, not exacerbate, the metabolic and amyloid pathologies.

The earliest pathological accumulation of tau colocalizes with the areas of the MTL involved in object processing as part of a wider anterolateral network. Here, we sought to assess the diagnostic potential of memory for object locations in iVR environments in individuals at high risk of AD dementia (amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI] n = 23) as compared to age-related cognitive decline. Consistent with our primary hypothesis that early AD would be associated with impaired object location, aMCI patients exhibited impaired spatial feature binding. Compared to both older (n = 24) and younger (n = 53) controls, aMCI patients, recalled object locations with significantly less accuracy (p < .001), with a trend toward an impaired identification of the object's correct context (p = .05). Importantly, these findings were not explained by deficits in object recognition (p = .6). These deficits differentiated aMCI from controls with greater accuracy (AUC = 0.89) than the standard neuropsychological tests. Within the aMCI group, 16 had CSF biomarkers indicative of their likely AD status (MCI+ n = 9 vs. MCI- n = 7). MCI+ showed lower accuracy in the object-context association than MCI- (p = .03) suggesting a selective deficit in object-context binding postulated to be associated with anterior-temporal areas. MRI volumetric analysis across healthy older participants and aMCI revealed that test performance positively correlates with lateral entorhinal cortex volumes (p < .05) and hippocampus volumes (p < .01), consistent with their hypothesized role in binding contextual and spatial information with object identity. Our results indicate that tests relying on the anterolateral object processing stream, and in particular requiring successful binding of an object with spatial information, may aid detection of pre-dementia AD due to the underlying early spread of tau pathology."

When tested in an animal model of AD, the APP/PS1 transgenic mice showed measurable improvements in spatial orientation and memory after the administration of YZD. These improvements coincided with significantly reduced deposition of Aβ plaques and tau protein in the hippocampi in the treated animals. In addition, a decreased BACE1 and beta-amyloid levels, a downregulation of the p-GSK-3β/GSK-3β, and an upregulation of the PI3K and p-AKT/AKT pathway was seen in YZD treated animals. These in vivo changes validated the involvement of molecular targets and pathways predicted in silico analysis of the chemical components of YZD. This study provides scientific support for the clinical use of YZD and justifies further investigations into its effects in AD.

These species are immunoreactive to the monoclonal antibody 6E10, which is directed against amino acids 6-10 of amyloid-β (Aβ), and their levels correlate with levels of total tau and tau phosphorylated at Thr181.

A sample of at least 12 community-dwelling older adults (with no or mild cognitive impairment) will be recruited for each group. Both groups will follow the same study procedures and assessment methods. However, the experimental group will engage with a co-designed VR exergame (Seas The Day) thrice weekly for approximately 20 minutes using the Oculus Quest 2 (Facebook Reality Labs) VR headset. The control group will read (instead of playing Seas The Day) thrice weekly for approximately 20 minutes over the 6-week period. A mixed methods evaluation will be used. Changes in physical activity, exercise self-efficacy, mood, cognition, and perception will be compared before and after acute data as well as before and after the 6 weeks between the experimental (exergaming) and control (reading) groups. Qualitative data from postintervention focus groups or interviews and informal notes and reports from all participants will be analyzed to assess the feasibility of the study protocol. Qualitative data from the experimental group will also be analyzed to assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of at-home VR exergames and explore perceived facilitators of and barriers to uptaking VR systems among community-dwelling older adults.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The screening and recruitment process for the experimental group started in May 2021, and the data collection process will be completed by September 2021. The timeline of the recruitment process for the control group is September 2021 to December 2021. We anticipate an estimated adherence rate of ≥80%. Challenges associated with VR technology and the complexity of remote assessments are expected.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This pilot study will provide important information on the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of a custom-made VR exergaming intervention to promote older adults' well-being.

However, these tests require qualified in-person supervision and the CDR can take up to 60 min to complete. We developed a digital cognitive screening test (M-CogScore) that can be completed remotely in under 5 min without supervision. We set out to validate M-CogScore in head-to-head comparisons with CDR and MMSE.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      To ascertain the validity of the M-CogScore, we enrolled participants as healthy controls or impaired cognition, matched for age, sex, and education. Participants completed the 30-item paper MMSE Second Edition Standard Version (MMSE-2), paper CDR, and smartphone-based M-CogScore. The digital M-CogScore test is based on time-normalised scores from smartphone-adapted Stroop (M-Stroop), digit-symbols (M-Symbols), and delayed recall tests (M-Memory). We used Spearman's correlation coefficient to determine the convergent validity between M-CogScore and the 30-item MMSE-2, and non-parametric tests to determine its discriminative validity with a CDR label of normal (CDR 0) or impaired cognition (CDR 0.5 or 1). M-CogScore was further compared to MMSE-2 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) with corresponding optimal cut-offs.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      72 participants completed all three tests. The M-CogScore correlated with both MMSE-2 (rho = 0.54, p < 0.0001) and impaired cognition on CDR (Mann Whitney U = 187, p < 0.001). M-CogScore achieved an AUC of 0.85 (95% bootstrapped CI [0.80, 0.91]), when differentiating between normal and impaired cognition, compared to an AUC of 0.78 [0.72, 0.84] for MMSE-2 (p = 0.21).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Digital screening tests such as M-CogScore are desirable to aid in rapid and remote clinical cognitive evaluations. M-CogScore was significantly correlated with established cognitive tests, including CDR and MMSE-2. M-CogScore can be taken remotely without supervision, is automatically scored, has less of a ceiling effect than the MMSE-2, and takes significantly less time to complete."

            "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted that the proteome can be used to identify potential biomarker candidates for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in diverse cohorts. Furthermore, the racial and ethnic background of participants is an important factor to consider to ensure the effectiveness of potential biomarkers for representative populations. A promising approach to survey potential biomarker candidates for diagnosing AD in diverse cohorts is the application of machine learning to proteomics data sets. Herein, we leveraged six existing bottom-up proteomics data sets, which included non-Hispanic White, African American/Black, and Hispanic participants, to study protein changes in AD and cognitively unimpaired participants. Machine learning models were applied to these data sets and resulted in the identification of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and heat shock protein β-1 (HSPB1) as two proteins that have high ability to distinguish AD; however, each protein's performance varied based upon the racial and ethnic background of the participants. HSPB1 particularly was helpful for generating high areas under the curve (AUCs) for African American/Black participants. Overall, HSPB1 improved the performance of the machine learning models when combined with APP and/or participant age and is a potential candidate that should be further explored in AD biomarker discovery efforts."

Cogmed is a computerized visuospatial cognitive training program that improves working memory in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

We assessed cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in a cohort of PD patients and healthy controls carriers of the G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene and the common GBA mutations, in an attempt to determine whether genetic status influences structural indexes. Cortical thickness and subcortical volumes were computed and compared between six groups of participants; idiopathic PD, GBA-PD, LRRK2-PD, non-manifesting non-carriers (NMNC), GBA-non-manifesting carriers (NMC) and LRRK2-NMC utilizing the FreeSurfer software program. All participants were cognitively intact based on a computerized cognitive assessment battery. Fifty-seven idiopathic PD patients, 9 LRRK2-PD, 12 GBA-PD, 49 NMNC, 41 LRRK2-NMC and 14 GBA-NMC participated in this study. Lower volumes among patients with PD compared to unaffected participants were detected in bilateral hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, caudate, thalamus, putamen and amygdala and the right pallidum (p = 0.016). PD patients demonstrated lower cortical thickness indexes in a majority of regions assessed compared with non-manifesting participants. No differences in cortical thickness and subcortical volumes were detected within each of the groups of participants based on genetic status. Mutations in the GBA and LRRK2 genes are not important determinants of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in both patients with PD and non-manifesting participants. PD is associated with a general reduction in cortical thickness and sub-cortical atrophy even in cognitively intact patients."

            "abstract": "Access to affordable, objective and scalable biomarkers of brain function is needed to transform the healthcare burden of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, both resting and in combination with targeted cognitive tasks, have demonstrated utility in tracking disease state and therapy response in a range of conditions from schizophrenia to Alzheimer's disease. But conventional methods of recording this data involve burdensome clinic visits, and behavioural tasks that are not effective in frequent repeated use. This paper aims to evaluate the technical and human-factors feasibility of gathering large-scale EEG using novel technology in the home environment with healthy adult users. In a large field study, 89 healthy adults aged 40-79 years volunteered to use the system at home for 12 weeks, 5 times/week, for 30 min/session. A 16-channel, dry-sensor, portable wireless headset recorded EEG while users played gamified cognitive and passive tasks through a tablet application, including tests of decision making, executive function and memory. Data was uploaded to cloud servers and remotely monitored via web-based dashboards. Seventy-eight participants completed the study, and high levels of adherence were maintained throughout across all age groups, with mean compliance over the 12-week period of 82% (4.1 sessions per week). Reported ease of use was also high with mean System Usability Scale scores of 78.7. Behavioural response measures (reaction time and accuracy) and EEG components elicited by gamified stimuli (P300, ERN, Pe and changes in power spectral density) were extracted from the data collected in home, across a wide range of ages, including older adult participants. Findings replicated well-known patterns of age-related change and demonstrated the feasibility of using low-burden, large-scale, longitudinal EEG measurement in community-based cohorts. This technology enables clinically relevant data to be recorded outside the lab/clinic, from which metrics underlying cognitive ageing could be extracted, opening the door to potential new ways of developing digital cognitive biomarkers for disorders affecting the brain."

It is less clear how a break in the continuous interaction between these two representations may be a crucial marker to detect patients who are at risk to develop dementia. The main objective of this study is to compare the performances of participants suffering from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI group), patients with AD (AD group) and a control group (CG), using a virtual reality (VR)-based procedure for assessing the abilities in encoding, storing and syncing different spatial representations. In the first task, participants were required to indicate on a real map the position of the object they had memorized, while in the second task they were invited to retrieve its position from an empty version of the same virtual room, starting from a different position. The entire procedure was repeated across three different trials, depending on the object location in the encoding phase. Our finding showed that aMCI patients performed significantly more poorly in the third trial of the first task, showing a deficit in the ability to encode and store an allocentric viewpoint independent representation. On the other hand, AD patients performed significantly more poorly when compared to the CG in the second task, indicating a specific impairment in storing an allocentric viewpoint independent representation and then syncing it with the allocentric viewpoint dependent representation. Furthermore, data suggested that these impairments are not a product of generalized cognitive decline or of general decay in spatial abilities, but instead may reflect a selective deficit in the spatial organization Overall, these findings provide an initial insight into the cognitive underpinnings of amnestic impairment in aMCI and AD patient exploiting the potentiality of VR."

We used linear regression models to examine the association between CVRFs and cognitive function.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      CVRF prevalence was 62.8% (n=150) for high cholesterol, 45.2% (n=108) for hypertension, 10.9% (n=26) for atrial fibrillation, and 7.5% (n=18) for diabetes. In multivariable models, atrial fibrillation was associated with worse working memory (β=-.51, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.11) and worse episodic memory (β=-.31, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.04); hypertension was associated with worse episodic memory (β=-.27, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.11). Diabetes and high cholesterol were not associated with cognitive performance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Self-administered web-based tools can be used to detect both CVRFs and cognitive health. We observed that atrial fibrillation and hypertension were associated with worse cognitive function even in those in their 60s and 70s. The potential of mobile assessments to detect risk factors for cognitive aging merits further investigation."

            "abstract": "Recent data collected on adult patients with vestibular loss (VL) tend to demonstrate possible cognitive impairments in visuospatial working memory, mental rotation, selective attention, and space orientation. However, the neuropsychological profile of children with VL remains largely under-investigated in the scientific literature. Although previous research has shown that children with VL may experience some degree of delayed motor development, it is not yet clear if VL could also lead to specific delayed cognitive development. In this study, we will present the development and validation of a new tablet-based computerized test battery (VSAD) that evaluates visuospatial working memory, mental rotation, selective attention, and space orientation abilities. Thirteen children with VL and 54 average-age matched healthy children performed the VSAD and classical paper-and-pencil neuropsychological tasks twice within a 1-month interval. Our results demonstrated a good concurrent validity with strong correlations between the visuospatial working memory, mental rotation, and space orientation tests of the VSAD and classical tasks. Test-retest reliability was also supported through good intra-class coefficients. However, the test of selective attention showed no concurrent validity with the matched classical task. The discriminant validity of the VSAD was partially supported for visuospatial working memory and mental rotation performance accuracy. The VSAD shows good concurrent validity and reliability for measuring visuospatial working memory, mental rotation, and space orientation in children with VL. Future studies are needed to extend discriminant validity with other populations."

A deeper understanding of the pathogenesis underlying neurodegenerative diseases is necessary to solve the unmet need for new diagnostic biomarkers and disease-modifying therapy and reduce these diseases' burden. Specifically, post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a significant role in neurodegeneration. Due to its proximity to the brain parenchyma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has long been used as an indirect way to measure changes in the brain. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis in neurodegenerative diseases focusing on PTMs and in the context of biomarker discovery has improved and opened venues for analyzing more complex matrices such as brain tissue and blood. Notably, phosphorylated tau protein, truncated α-synuclein, APP and TDP-43, and many other modifications were extensively characterized by MS. Great potential is underlying specific pathological PTM-signatures for clinical application.

Spatial orientation data from 93 individuals (65 AD at a mild stage, 20 MCI, and 8 other dementia types) based on VR localization of a target on a landmark-less cubic 3-story building were analyzed. We hypothesize AD and MCI groups' performances are significantly different. AD and MCI spatial performances were statistically significantly (p < 0.001) different.

The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of cognitive and motor factors to the performance of PD patients under high cognitive and kinematic loads. Twenty-six PD patients and 14 control subjects participated in the study. The PD patients performed a task involving hitting targets and avoiding distractors in levodopa On and Off states. A robotic manipulandum device recorded the numbers of target and distractor hits and hand kinematics, including movement area and speed. Performance on standard cognitive batteries and the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores were examined. The results indicated that the PD patients hit significantly fewer targets and more distractors than did the controls (p < 0.05). In PD patients, the average hand speed was slower and the area of hand movement was smaller than those of the control subjects (p < 0.001). Levodopa significantly increased the average hand speed and movement area (p < 0.01), but levodopa had an insignificant effect on the number of correct targets hit and erroneous distractor hits. The scores of cognitive batteries predicted the performance with regard to both targets hit and distractor avoidance. Our results were indicative of a dynamic interaction between cognitive and kinematic skills while the PD patients performed a virtual reality game.

Prevention of age-related cognitive impairment in older persons with lifestyle interventions continues to garner evidence but whether this can combat underlying neurodegeneration is unknown. The Study of Mental Activity and Resistance Training (SMART) trial has previously reported within-training findings; the aim of this study was to investigate the long-term neurostructural and cognitive impact of resistance exercise in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). For the first time we show that hippocampal subareas particularly susceptible to volume loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are protected by resistance exercise for up to one year after training. One hundred MCI participants were randomised to one of four training groups: (1) Combined high intensity progressive resistance and computerised cognitive training (PRT+CCT), (2) PRT+Sham CCT, (3) CCT+Sham PRT, (4) Sham physical+sham cognitive training (SHAM+SHAM). Physical, neuropsychological and MRI assessments were carried out at baseline, 6 months (directly after training) and 18 months from baseline (12 months after intervention cessation). Here we report neuro-structural and functional changes over the 18-month trial period and the association with global cognitive and executive function measures. PRT but not CCT or PRT+CCT led to global long-term cognitive improvements above SHAM intervention at 18-month follow-up. Furthermore, hippocampal subfields susceptible to atrophy in AD were protected by PRT revealing an elimination of long-term atrophy in the left subiculum, and attenuation of atrophy in left CA1 and dentate gyrus when compared to SHAM+SHAM (p = 0.023, p = 0.020 and p = 0.027). These neuroprotective effects mediated a significant portion of long-term cognitive benefits. By contrast, within-training posterior cingulate plasticity decayed after training cessation and was unrelated to long term cognitive benefits. Neither general physical activity levels nor fitness change over the 18-month period mediated hippocampal trajectory, demonstrating that enduring hippocampal subfield plasticity is not a simple reflection of post-training changes in fitness or physical activity participation. Notably, resting-state fMRI analysis revealed that both the hippocampus and posterior cingulate participate in a functional network that continued to be upregulated following intervention cessation. Multiple structural mechanisms may contribute to the long-term global cognitive benefit of resistance exercise, developing along different time courses but functionally linked. For the first time we show that 6 months of high intensity resistance exercise is capable of not only promoting better cognition in those with MCI, but also protecting AD-vulnerable hippocampal subfields from degeneration for at least 12 months post-intervention. These findings emphasise the therapeutic potential of resistance exercise; however, future work will need to establish just how long-lived these outcomes are and whether they are sufficient to delay dementia."

            "abstract": "Using virtual reality, we implemented a naturalistic variant of the DRM paradigm in young and older adults to evaluate false recall and false recognition. We distinguished false recognition related to the highest semantic association (the critical lures), semantic similarity (i.e. items that belong to the same semantic category), and perceptual similarity (i.e. items that are similar, but not identical in terms of shape or color). The data revealed that younger adults recalled and recognized more correct elements than older adults did while the older adults intruded more critical items than younger adults. Both age groups produced false recognition related to the critical items, followed by perceptually and then semantically related items. False recognitions were highly recollective as they were mainly associated with a sense of remembering, even more so in older adults than in young adults. The decline of executive functions and working memory predicted age-related increases in false memories."

            "abstract": "Immersive virtual reality is proving effective as a non-pharmacologic analgesic for a growing number of painful medical procedures. External fixator surgical pins provide adjunctive stability to a broken pelvic bone until the bones heal back together, then pins are removed. The purpose of the present case study was to measure for the first time, whether immersive virtual reality could be used to help reduce pain and anxiety during the orthopedic process of removing external fixator pins from a conscious patient in the orthopedic outpatient clinic, and whether it is feasible to use VR in this context. Using a within-subject within wound care design with treatment order randomized, the patient had his first ex-fix pin unscrewed and removed from his healing pelvic bone while he wore a VR helmet and explored an immersive snowy 3D computer generated world, adjunctive VR. He then had his second pin removed during no VR, standard of care pain medications. The patient reported having 43% less pain intensity, 67% less time spent thinking about pain, and 43% lower anxiety during VR vs. during No VR. In addition, the patient reported that his satisfaction with pain management was improved with the use of VR. Conducting simple orthopedic procedures using oral pain pills in an outpatient setting instead of anesthesia in the operating room greatly reduces the amount of opioids used, lowers medical costs and reduces rare but real risks of expensive complications from anesthesia including oversedation, death, and post-surgical dementia. These preliminary results suggest that immersive VR merits more attention as a potentially viable adjunctive non-pharmacologic form of treatment for acute pain and anxiety during medical procedures in the orthopedic outpatient clinic. Recent multi-billion dollar investments into R and D and mass production have made inexpensive immersive virtual reality products commercially available and cost effective for medical applications. We speculate that in the future, patients may be more willing to have minor surgery procedures in the outpatient clinic, with much lower opioid doses, while fully awake, if offered adjunctive virtual reality as a non-pharmacologic analgesic during the procedure. Additional research and development is recommended."

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the complex interaction of multiple mechanisms. Recent studies examining the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the AD phenotype have demonstrated a significant influence on both inflammation and cognition. However, different studies on the effect of high-fat diet on AD pathology have reported conflicting conclusions. To explore the involvement of HFD in AD, we investigated phenotypic and metabolic changes in an AD mouse model in response to HFD. The results indicated there was no significant effect on Aβ levels or contextual memory due to HFD treatment. Of note, HFD did moderate neuroinflammation, despite spurring inflammation and increasing cholesterol levels in the periphery. In addition, diet affected gut microbiota symbiosis, altering the production of bacterial metabolites. HFD created a favorable microenvironment for bile acid alteration and arachidonic acid metabolism in APP/PS1 mice, which may be related to the observed improvement in LXR/PPAR expression. Our previous research demonstrated that Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJDD) significantly ameliorated impaired learning and memory. Furthermore, HLJDD may globally suppress inflammation and lipid accumulation to relieve cognitive impairment after HFD intervention. It was difficult to define the effect of HFD on AD progression because the results were influenced by confounding factors and biases. Although there was still obvious damage in AD mice treated with HFD, there was no deterioration and there was even a slight remission of neuroinflammation. Moreover, HLJDD represents a potential AD drug based on its anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering effects."

Healthy young adults (N = 54, M = 20.65, SD = 2.06, 30 females) completed the CONVIRT test battery (manual simple and choice reaction-time and saccade reaction-time) at three breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) levels: 0.00%T1, 0.05%T2, 0.08%T3.

All three CONVIRT measures were sensitive to changes in cognitive performance induced by alcohol at BrAC levels at or exceeding 0.05%. A composite measure was also sensitive to alcohol intoxication (Cohen's d = .85 at BrAC = 0.05%; d = 1.20 at BrAC = 0.08%). Strong test-retest reliability was observed (all r < .80), with no gender differences noted.

To control viral transmission, social distancing measures have been implemented all over the world, interrupting the access to routine medical care for many individuals with neurological diseases. Cognitive disorders are common in many neurological conditions, e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and other types of dementia, Parkinson's disease and parkinsonian syndromes, and multiple sclerosis, and should be addressed by cognitive rehabilitation interventions. To be effective, cognitive rehabilitation programs must be intensive and prolonged over time; however, the current virus containment measures are hampering their implementation. Moreover, the reduced access to cognitive rehabilitation might worsen the relationship between the patient and the healthcare professional. Urgent measures to address issues connected to COVID-19 pandemic are, therefore, needed. Remote communication technologies are increasingly regarded as potential effective options to support health care interventions, including neurorehabilitation and cognitive rehabilitation. Among them, telemedicine, virtual reality, augmented reality, and serious games could be in the forefront of these efforts. We will briefly review current evidence-based recommendations on the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation and offer a perspective on the role of tele- and virtual rehabilitation to achieve adequate cognitive stimulation in the era of social distancing related to COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we will discuss issues related to their diffusion and propose a roadmap to address them.

Mutations in pathological genes, including amyloid protein precursor (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2), were associated with EOAD. Seventy-six mutations in PSEN2 have been found around the world, which could affect the activity of γ-secretase in amyloid beta processing. Here, a heterozygous PSEN2 point mutation from G to A nucleotide change at position 166 (codon 56; c.166G>A, Gly56Ser) was identified in a 64-year-old Korean female with AD with progressive cognitive memory impairment for the 4 years prior to the hospital visit. Hippocampal atrophy was observed from magnetic resonance imaging-based neuroimaging analyses. Temporal and parietal cortex hypometabolisms were identified using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. This mutation was at the N-terminal portion of the presenilin 2 protein on the cytosolic side. Therefore, the serine substitution may have promoted AD pathogenesis by perturbing to the mutation region through altered phosphorylation of presenilin. In silico analysis revealed that the mutation altered protein bulkiness with increased hydrophilicity and reduced flexibility of the mutated region of the protein. Structural changes were likely caused by intramolecular interactions between serine and other residues, which may have affected APP processing. The functional study will clarify the pathogenicity of the mutation in the future."

This study investigated the intrinsic mechanism of BDMC against AD in animal models.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this study, BDMC was injected into the lateral ventricles of normal C57BL/6 mice, APP/PS mice, and APP/PS mice treated with EX527 (the inhibitor of SIRT1). Y maze and Morris water maze were used to test the learning and memory ability of mice. Nissl staining was used to observe the morphological changes of neurons. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect Aβ deposition in mice. The activities of GSH and SOD were determined to observe the levels of oxidative stress in mice. And Western blot analyses were used to detect content of SIRT1 in mice.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the APP/PS mice, after BDMC intervention, their cognitive function improved, oxidative stress adjusted, the number of neurons increased, Aβ deposition decreased, and the level of SIRT1 expression increased. However, when SIRT1 is inhibited, BDMC on the improvement in the learning and memory ability and the improvement on oxidative stress in APP/PS1 mice were reversed.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our findings demonstrated that in the AD mice, BDMC has antagonistic effect on AD. And an intermediate step in the antagonism effect is caused by SIRT1 upregulation, which leading to decreased oxidative stress. Based on these, we concluded that BDMC injection into the lateral ventricle can act against AD by upregulating SIRT1 to antioxidative stress."

            "abstract": "Cognitive testing data are essential to the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and computerized cognitive testing, such as the Cogstate Brief Battery, has proven helpful in efficiently identifying harbingers of dementia. This study provides a side-by-side comparison of traditional Cogstate outcomes and diffusion modeling of these outcomes in predicting MCI diagnosis. Participants included 257 older adults (160 = normal cognition; 97 = MCI). Results showed that both traditional Cogstate and diffusion modeling analyses predicted MCI diagnosis with acceptable accuracy. Cogstate measures of recognition learning and working memory accuracy and diffusion modeling variable of decision-making efficiency (drift rate) and nondecisional time were most predictive of MCI. While participants with normal cognition demonstrated a change in response caution (boundary separation) when transitioning tasks, participants with MCI did not evidence this change."

We developed a computerized cognitive screening test (Inbrain Cognitive Screening Test [Inbrain CST]) that takes about 30 minutes to administer on a touchscreen computer and is composed of neuropsychological tests already shown to be sensitive in detecting early cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aims of this study were to 1) introduce normative data for Inbrain CST, 2) verify its reliability and validity, 3) assess clinical usefulness, and 4) identify neuroanatomical correlates of Inbrain CST.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The Inbrain CST runs on the Microsoft Windows 10 operating system and comprises 7 subtests that encompass 5 cognitive domains: attention, language, visuospatial, memory, and executive functions. First, we recruited 480 cognitively normal elderly people (age 50-90) from communities nationwide to establish normative data for Inbrain CST. Second, we enrolled 97 patients from our dementia clinic (26 with subjective cognitive decline [SCD], 42 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI], and 29 with dementia due to AD) and investigated sensitivity and specificity of Inbrain CST for discriminating cognitively impaired patients from those with SCD using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Third, we compared the Inbrain CST scores with those from another neuropsychological test battery to obtain concurrent validity and assessed test-retest reliability. Finally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based cortical thickness analyses were performed to provide anatomical substrates for performances on the Inbrain CST.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      First, in the normative sample, the total score on the Inbrain CST was significantly affected by age, years of education, and gender. Second, Inbrain CST scores among the three patient groups decreased in the order of SCD, aMCI, and AD dementia, and the ROC curve analysis revealed that Inbrain CST had good discriminative power for differentiating cognitively impaired patients from those with SCD. Third, the Inbrain CST subtests had high concurrent validity and test-retest reliability. Finally, in the cortical thickness analysis, each cognitive domain score and the total score of Inbrain CST showed distinct patterns of anatomical correlates that fit into the previously known brain-behavior relationship.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Inbrain CST had good validity, reliability, and clinical usefulness in detecting cognitive impairment in the elderly.

            "abstract": "Currently, due to the demographic trends, the number of aging population groups is dramatically rising, especially in developed countries. This trend causes serious economic and social issues, but also an increase of aging disorders such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in older population groups. MCI and dementia are connected with deterioration of cognitive functions. The aim of this mini review article is therefore to explore whether computer-based training programs might be an effective intervention tool for older people with MCI and/or dementia or not. The methods include a literature search in the world's acknowledged databases: Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, MEDLINE and Springer, and consequently, evaluation of the findings of the relevant studies. The findings from the selected studies are quite neutral with respect to the efficacy of the computer assisted intervention programs on the improvement of basic cognitive functions. On the one hand, they suggest that the computer-based training interventions might generate some positive effects on patients with MCI and/or dementia, such as the improvement of learning and short-term memory, as well as behavioral symptoms. On the other hand, these training interventions seem to be short-term, with small sample sizes and their efficacy was proved only in the half of the detected studies. Therefore more longitudinal randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to prove the efficacy of the computer-based training programs among older individuals with MCI and/or dementia."

            "abstract": "Prior research has found that cognitive benefits of physical exercise and brain health in older adults may be enhanced when mental exercise is interactive simultaneously, as in exergaming. It is unclear whether the cognitive benefit can be maximized by increasing the degree of mental challenge during exercise. This randomized clinical trial (RCT), the Aerobic and Cognitive Exercise Study (ACES) sought to replicate and extend prior findings of added cognitive benefit from exergaming to those with or at risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). ACES compares the effects of 6 months of an exer-tour (virtual reality bike rides) with the effects of a more effortful exer-score (pedaling through a videogame to score points). Fourteen community-dwelling older adults meeting screening criteria for MCI (sMCI) were adherent to their assigned exercise for 6 months. The primary outcome was executive function, while secondary outcomes included memory and everyday cognitive function. Exer-tour and exer-score yielded significant moderate effects on executive function (Stroop A/C; d's = 0.51 and 0.47); there was no significant interaction effect. However, after 3 months the exer-tour revealed a significant and moderate effect, while exer-score showed little impact, as did a game-only condition. Both exer-tour and exer-score conditions also resulted in significant improvements in verbal memory. Effects appear to generalize to self-reported everyday cognitive function. Pilot data, including salivary biomarkers and structural MRI, were gathered at baseline and 6 months; exercise dose was associated with increased BDNF as well as increased gray matter volume in the PFC and ACC. Improvement in memory was associated with an increase in the DLPFC. Improved executive function was associated with increased expression of exosomal miRNA-9. Interactive physical and cognitive exercise (both high and low mental challenge) yielded similarly significant cognitive benefit for adherent sMCI exercisers over 6 months. A larger RCT is needed to confirm these findings. Further innovation and clinical trial data are needed to develop accessible, yet engaging and effective interventions to combat cognitive decline for the growing MCI population.

One potential mechanism is aortic stiffness, with increased stiffness resulting in higher pulsatile pressures reaching the brain and possibly causing progressive micro-damage. There is limited evidence that those who regularly exercise may have lower aortic stiffness.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To investigate whether greater fitness and lower aortic stiffness predict better cognitive performance in older people and, if so, whether aortic stiffness mediates the relationship between fitness and cognition.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Residents of independent living facilities, aged 60-90, participated in the study (N = 102).

Based on hierarchical regression analyses, structural equation modelling was used to test the mediation hypothesis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Both fitness and aortic stiffness independently predicted Spatial Working Memory (SWM) performance, however no mediating relationship was found. Additionally, the derived structural equation model shows that, in conjunction with BMI and sex, fitness and aortic stiffness explain 33% of the overall variation in SWM, with age no longer directly predicting any variation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Greater fitness and lower aortic stiffness both independently predict better SWM in older people.

Animal-like social robots are increasingly used in dementia care as they can provide companionship and engage PWD in meaningful activities. While most previous human-robot interaction (HRI) research studied engagement independent from the context, recent findings indicate that the context of HRI sessions has an impact on user engagement. This study aims to explore the effects of contextual interactions between PWD and a social robot embedded in the augmented responsive environment. Three experimental conditions were compared: reactive context-enhanced robot interaction; dynamic context-enhanced interaction with a static robot; a control condition with only the dynamic context presented. Effectiveness evaluations were performed with 16 participants using four observational rating scales on observed engagement, affective states, and apathy related behaviors. Findings suggested that the higher level of interactivity of a social robot and the interactive contextualized feedback helped capture and maintain users' attention during engagement; however, it did not significantly improve their positive affective states. Additionally, the presence of either a static or a proactive robot reduced apathy-related behaviors by facilitating purposeful activities, thus, motivating behavioral engagement."

The convergent validity of this assessment was established in comparison to the ACE-R, CERAD and Rey-Osterrieth. Divergent validity was established through comparison with the BDI and tests measuring divergent cognitive domains. Internal consistency of each subtask was evaluated, and test-retest reliability was determined. We established the normative impairment cut-offs for each of the subtasks. Predicted convergent and divergent validity was found, high internal consistency for most measures was also found with the exception of restricted range tasks, as well as strong test-retest reliability, which provided evidence of test stability.

The primary outcomes were functional activity level and QOL. The secondary outcome was cognitive examination. Group assignment was random. Group A (n = 30) underwent CogniPlus, a computer-based, cognitive training. Group B (n = 30) underwent classical group-based cognitive training. Both programs comprised two 30-minute sessions per week for 10 weeks. After training, group A had better QOL (p < 0.001, effect size [ES] = 0.69) and better attention (increased load score, p < 0.05, ES = -0.23; errors, p < 0.001, ES = -0.47); however, there were no group differences in functional activity level. Group A demonstrated larger improvements in QOL and attention than group B (i.e., classical cognitive training), but the transfer to functional activities was the same between groups.

            "abstract": "Questionnaires or computer-based tests for assessing activities of daily living are well-known approaches to screen for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, questionnaires are subjective and computerized tests only collect simple performance data with conventional input devices such as a mouse and keyboard. This study explored the validity and discriminative power of a virtual daily living test as a new diagnostic approach to assess MCI. Twenty-two healthy controls and 20 patients with MCI were recruited. The virtual daily living test presents two complex daily living tasks in an immersive virtual reality environment. The tasks were conducted based on subject body movements and detailed behavioral data (i.e., kinematic measures) were collected. Performance in both the proposed virtual daily living test and conventional neuropsychological tests for patients with MCI was compared to healthy controls. Kinematic measures considered in this study, such as body movement trajectory, time to completion, and speed, classified patients with MCI from healthy controls, F(8, 33) = 5.648, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.578. When both hand and head speed were employed in conjunction with the immediate free-recall test, a conventional neuropsychological test, the discrimination power for screening MCI was significantly improved to 90% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity (cf. the immediate free-recall test alone has 80% sensitivity and 77.3% specificity). Inclusion of the kinematic measures in screening for MCI significantly improved the classification of patients with MCI compared to the healthy control group, Wilks' Lambda = 0.451, p < 0.001."

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a complex pathogenesis. Controlled release, target ability, and multi-channel synergistic treatment are key factors associated with the success of AD drugs. Herein, we report a novel mesoporous nano-selenium (MSe) release delivery system (MSe-Res/Fc-β-CD/Bor) based on the borneol (Bor) target, β-cyclodextrin nanovalves (Fc-β-CD) with loaded resveratrol (Res). Previous experiments have shown that MSe-Res/Fc-β-CD/Bor first releases Bor by interacting with blood or intracellular esterases, allowing the nanosystem to pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Subsequently, the Fc-β-CD is opened by the redox (H2O2) response to the release of Res at the lesion site. We demonstrated that MSe-Res/Fc-β-CD/Bor inhibited aggregation of β-amyloid proteins (Aβ), mitigated oxidative stress, and suppressed tau hyperphosphorylation, while protecting nerve cells and successfully improving memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Interestingly, compared with rivastigmine (Riv) positive drugs alone, the MSe/Fc-β-CD/Bor loaded with Riv had a better pharmacokinetic index. These results indicate that MSe-Res/Fc-β-CD/Bor could be a prospective drug for treating AD."

Healthy male and female adult subjects received tizanidine (8 mg) as tablets and capsules under fasting and nonfasting conditions. Blood samples were collected to determine plasma tizanidine pharmacokinetic profiles, and computerized cognitive function tests were performed that yielded a validated composite score, Power of Attention, an index of sedation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Ninety-six patients were enrolled in the study (54 men, 42 women; mean [SD] age, 27 [8] years [range, 18-52 years]; mean [SD] body weight, 71.7 [12.4] kg [range, 46-102 kg]). Tizanidine tablets and capsules were found to be bioequivalent after fasting. In the fed state, mean C(max) and AUC(0-t) were substantially decreased, by 33.8% and 15.4%, comparing the capsules and tablets, respectively. The median T(max) increased significantly from 1.41 to 3.0 hours (P < 0.001).

The onset of impairment in Power of Attention was significantly delayed from 0.75 to 1.5 hours postdose when capsules were administered with food compared with the other conditions (P < 0.001). The most commonly reported adverse events were asthenia, somnolence, and orthostatic hypotension. A significantly lower adverse event rate was observed in the combined capsules group compared with the tablets, suggesting that differences in tolerability may exist.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The results of this study in healthy volunteers suggest that the capsule and tablet formulations of tizanidine were bioequivalent only in the fasted state. The capsule formulation exhibited a food effect that reduced C(max) and AUC(0-t), and significantly increased T(max), which was associated with a delay in cognitive impairment. The large interpatient variability in plasma profiles most likely dampened the ability to fully elucidate the differences between the 2 formulations."

            "abstract": "Calmodulin-like skin protein (CLSP), a secreted peptide, inhibits neuronal death in cell-based Alzheimer's disease (AD) models and transgenic overexpression of the CLSP gene suppresses synaptic loss and memory impairment in AD model mice, APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice (APP/PS1 mice). Despite the anticipated role of CLSP as an AD-suppressing factor, it remains unanswered whether the insufficiency of the CLSP activity is linked to the AD pathogenesis. In this study, we first show that adiponectin, a CLSP potentiator/protector, dominantly determines the CLSP activity in the central nervous system where there are sufficient concentrations of CLSP, higher concentrations of CLSP inhibitors such as apolipoprotein E, and smaller concentrations of adiponectin. We next show that both the levels of brain adiponectin and the intraneuronal levels of SH3BP5, an important effector of the CLSP signal, are reduced in both AD patients and APP/PS1 mice. Finally, the restoration of the CLSP activity by subcutaneous injection of a hybrid peptide named CLSPCOL consisting of CLSP(1-61) and the collagen-homologous region of adiponectin, which has more potent neuroprotective activity than CLSP, is insensitive to the suppression by the CLSP inhibitors, and is efficiently recruited into brains, alleviates dementia and synaptic loss in the aged APP/PS1 mice. Collectively, these results suggest that the reduction in the CLSP activity, likely caused by the reduction in the levels of adiponectin, leads to the insufficient protection of neurons from neurotoxicity in the AD brains and the restoration of the CLSP activity is a promising strategy for the treatment of AD."

Serious game (SG) -based cognitive and motor performance profiles while performing everyday activities and dual-task walking (DTW) \"motor signatures\" are two very promising markers that can be detected in predementia states. We aim to compare the consistency, or conformity, of measurements made by a custom SG with DTW (NAV), a SG without DTW (DOT), neuropsychological measures and genotyping as markers for early detection of aMCI.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study population included three groups: early AD (n = 86), aMCI (n = 65), and healthy control subjects (n = 76), who completed the custom SG tasks in three separate sessions over a 3-month period. Outcome measures were neuropsychological data across-domain and within-domain intra-individual variability (IIV) and DOT and NAV latency-based and accuracy-based IIV. IIV reflects a transient, within-person change in behavioral performance, either during different cognitive domains (across-domain) or within the same domain (within-domain).

Additionally, reliability across tasks was more stable when three sessions were used in the ICC calculation relative to two sessions.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Our findings suggest that \"motor signature\" data during the NAV tasks were a more reliable marker for early diagnosis of aMCI than DOT.

Approaches include stem cell transplantation, which improved memory in several animal studies as well as vaccination against Alzheimer´s disease (AD) by β-amyloid antibodies. For a positive clinical effect, the vaccine should probably be administered over a long period of time and before amyloid pathologies manifest in the brain. Different drugs, such as erythropoietin or antiplatelet therapy, improve memory in neuropsychiatric diseases or AD or at least in animal studies. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid-rich diets improve memory through the gut-brain axis by altering the gut flora through probiotics. Sports, dancing, and memory techniques (e.g., Method of Loci) utilize behavioral approaches for memory enhancement, and were effective in several studies. Augmented reality (AR) is an auspicious way for enhancing memory in real time. Future approaches may include memory prosthesis for head-injured patients and light therapy for restoring memory in AD. Memory enhancement in humans in health and disease holds big promises for the future. Memory training helps only in mild or no impairment. Clinical application requires further investigation."

The discriminant power was compared between the SCT-VR and the MoCA-K, and the reliability and validity of the SCT-VR were analyzed. The spatial memory, assessed by the SCT-VR, showed better sensitivity and specificity (sensitivity: 0.944; specificity: 0.964) than the MoCA-K (sensitivity: 0.857; specificity: 0.746).

The assessment of driving-relevant cognition in older drivers is challenging and requires reliable and valid tests with good sensitivity and specificity to predict safe driving. Driving simulators can be used to test fitness to drive. Several studies have found strong correlation between driving simulator performance and on-the-road driving. However, access to driving simulators is restricted to specialists and simulators are too expensive, large, and complex to allow easy access to older drivers or physicians advising them. An easily accessible, Web-based, cognitive screening test could offer a solution to this problem. The World Wide Web allows easy dissemination of the test software and implementation of the scoring algorithm on a central server, allowing generation of a dynamically growing database with normative values and ensures that all users have access to the same up-to-date normative values.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      In this pilot study, we present the novel Web-based Bern Cognitive Screening Test (wBCST) and investigate whether it can predict poor simulated driving performance in healthy and cognitive-impaired participants.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The wBCST performance and simulated driving performance have been analyzed in 26 healthy younger and 44 healthy older participants as well as in 10 older participants with cognitive impairment.

Patients and Methods We recruited adult cancer survivors with a primary malignancy (excluding central nervous system malignancies) who had completed three or more cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy in the previous 6 to 60 months and reported persistent cognitive symptoms. All participants received a 30-minute telephone consultation and were then randomly assigned to the 15-week, home-based intervention or to standard care. Primary outcome was self-reported cognitive function (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Cognitive Function [FACT-COG] perceived cognitive impairment [PCI] subscale): difference between groups after intervention (T2) and 6 months later (T3). Results A total of 242 participants were randomly assigned: median age, 53 years; 95% female. The primary outcome of difference in FACT-COG PCI was significant, with less PCI in the intervention group at T2 ( P < .001). This difference was sustained at T3 ( P < .001). At T2, there was a significant difference in all FACT-COG subscales, favoring the intervention. Neuropsychological results were not significantly different between the groups at T2 or T3.

However, in the majority of such studies, the nature of rodent behavioral tests is considerably different from the setting associated with cognitive assessments of individuals with AD. The recently developed touchscreen technique provides a more translational way of rodent cognitive testing because the stimulus (images in different locations on the screen) and reaction (touch) are similar to those employed in human test routines, such as the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Here, we used Visual Discrimination and Reversal of Visual Discrimination touchscreen tasks to assess cognitive performance of APPSwDI/Nos2-/- (CVN) mice, which express mutated human APP and have a homozygous deletion of the Nos2 gene. We revealed that CVN mice made more first-time errors and received more correction trials than WT mice across both discrimination and reversal phases, although mutation effect size was larger during the latter phase. These results indicate sensitivity of touchscreen-based measurements to AD-relevant mutations in CVN mice and warrant future touchscreen experiments aimed at evaluating other cognitive and motivational phenotypes in this AD mouse model."

            "abstract": "Cognitive functioning can be assessed with performance-based assessments such as neuropsychological tests and with interview-based assessments. Both assessment methods have the potential to assess whether treatments for schizophrenia improve clinically relevant aspects of cognitive impairment. However, little is known about the reliability, validity and treatment responsiveness of interview-based measures, especially in the context of clinical trials. Data from two studies were utilized to assess these features of the Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS). One of the studies was a validation study involving 79 patients with schizophrenia assessed at 3 academic research centers in the US. The other study was a 32-site clinical trial conducted in the US and Europe comparing the effects of encenicline, an alpha-7 nicotine agonist, to placebo in 319 patients with schizophrenia. The SCoRS interviewer ratings demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability in several different circumstances, including those that did not involve treatment (ICC> 0.90), and during treatment (ICC>0.80). SCoRS interviewer ratings were related to cognitive performance as measured by the MCCB (r=-0.35), and demonstrated significant sensitivity to treatment with encenicline compared to placebo (P<.001). These data suggest that the SCoRS has potential as a clinically relevant measure in clinical trials aiming to improve cognition in schizophrenia, and may be useful for clinical practice. The weaknesses of the SCoRS include its reliance on informant information, which is not available for some patients, and reduced validity when patient's self-report is the sole information source."

These signals have been shown to shape neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex (V1), in an experience-dependent manner. Here, we examined whether visual, reward, and self-motion-related inputs are integrated in order to encode behaviorally relevant locations in V1 neurons. Using a behavioral task in a virtual environment, we monitored layer 2/3 neuronal activity as mice learned to locate a reward along a linear corridor. With learning, a subset of neurons became responsive to the expected reward location. Without a visual cue to the reward location, both behavioral and neuronal responses relied on self-motion-derived estimations. However, when visual cues were available, both neuronal and behavioral responses were driven by visual information. Therefore, a population of V1 neurons encode behaviorally relevant spatial locations, based on either visual cues or on self-motion feedback when visual cues are absent."

The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) is a questionnaire instrument, completed by a suitable 'informant' who knows the patient well, designed to assess change in functional performance secondary to cognitive change; it is used as a tool to identifying those who may have dementia.In secondary care there are two specific instances where patients may be assessed for the presence of dementia. These are in the general acute hospital setting, where opportunistic screening may be undertaken, or in specialist memory services where individuals have been referred due to perceived cognitive problems. To ensure an instrument is suitable for diagnostic use in these settings, its test accuracy must be established.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the informant-based questionnaire IQCODE, for detection of all-cause (undifferentiated) dementia in adults presenting to secondary-care services.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the following sources on the 28th of January 2013: ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), BIOSIS Previews (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science Core Collection (includes Conference Proceedings Citation Index) (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (BIREME). We also searched sources specific to diagnostic test accuracy: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven); DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects - via the Cochrane Library); HTA Database (Health Technology Assessment Database via the Cochrane Library) and ARIF (Birmingham University). We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, used searches of known relevant studies in PubMed to track related articles, and contacted research groups conducting work on IQCODE for dementia diagnosis to try to find additional studies. We developed a sensitive search strategy; search terms were designed to cover key concepts using several different approaches run in parallel and included terms relating to cognitive tests, cognitive screening and dementia. We used standardised database subject headings such as MeSH terms (in MEDLINE) and other standardised headings (controlled vocabulary) in other databases, as appropriate.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We selected those studies performed in secondary-care settings, which included (not necessarily exclusively) IQCODE to assess for the presence of dementia and where dementia diagnosis was confirmed with clinical assessment. For the 'secondary care' setting we included all studies which assessed patients in hospital (e.g. acute unscheduled admissions, referrals to specialist geriatric assessment services etc.) and those referred for specialist 'memory' assessment, typically in psychogeriatric services.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We screened all titles generated by electronic database searches, and reviewed abstracts of all potentially relevant studies. Two independent assessors checked full papers for eligibility and extracted data. We determined quality assessment (risk of bias and applicability) using the QUADAS-2 tool, and reporting quality using the STARD tool.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      From 72 papers describing IQCODE test accuracy, we included 13 papers, representing data from 2745 individuals (n = 1413 (51%) with dementia). Pooled analysis of all studies using data presented closest to a cut-off of 3.3 indicated that sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.94); specificity 0.66 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.75); the positive likelihood ratio was 2.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.6) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.14 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.22).There was a statistically significant difference in test accuracy between the general hospital setting and the specialist memory setting (P = 0.019), suggesting that IQCODE performs better in a 'general' setting.We found no significant differences in the test accuracy of the short (16-item) versus the 26-item IQCODE, or in the language of administration.There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies, including a highly varied prevalence of dementia (10.5% to 87.4%). Across the included papers there was substantial potential for bias, particularly around sampling of included participants and selection criteria, which may limit generalisability. There was also evidence of suboptimal reporting, particularly around disease severity and handling indeterminate results, which are important if considering use in clinical practice.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The IQCODE can be used to identify older adults in the general hospital setting who are at risk of dementia and require specialist assessment; it is useful specifically for ruling out those without evidence of cognitive decline. The language of administration did not affect test accuracy, which supports the cross-cultural use of the tool. These findings are qualified by the significant heterogeneity, the potential for bias and suboptimal reporting found in the included studies."

Assistive technology has been recognized as a promising tool to improve the lives of persons living with memory loss and their caregivers. The use of assistive technology in dementia care is expanding, although it is most often intended to manage care and promote safety. There is a lack of assistive technology designed to aid persons with memory loss in participating in meaningful activities.

When mild cognitive impairment (MCI) occurs in elderly, it is frequently a prodromal condition to dementia. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a commonly used tool to screen for MCI. However, this test requires a face-to-face administration and is composed of an assortment of questions whose responses are added together by the rater to provide a score whose precise meaning has been controversial. This study was designed to evaluate the performance of a computerized memory test (MemTrax), which is an adaptation of a continuous recognition task, with respect to the MoCA. Two outcome measures are generated from the MemTrax test: MemTraxspeed and MemTraxcorrect. Subjects were administered the MoCA and the MemTrax test. Based on the results of the MoCA, subjects were divided in two groups of cognitive status: normal cognition (n = 45) and MCI (n = 37). Mean MemTrax scores were significantly lower in the MCI than in the normal cognition group. All MemTrax outcome variables were positively associated with the MoCA. Two methods, computing the average MTX score and linear regression were used to estimate the cutoff values of the MemTrax test to detect MCI. These methods showed that for the outcome MemTraxspeed a score below the range of 0.87 - 91 s-1 is an indication of MCI, and for the outcome MemTraxcorrect a score below the range of 85 - 90% is an indication for MCI."

Work identifying amyloid precursor protein (APP) as a vesicular motor receptor for anterograde axonal transport further implicates axonal transport in AD. Manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) detects axonal transport dynamics in preclinical studies. Here we pursue an understanding of the role of APP in axonal transport in the central nervous system by applying MEMRI to hippocampal circuitry and to the visual pathway in living mice homozygous for either wild type or a deletion in the APP gene (n=12 for each genotype). Following intra-ocular or stereotaxic hippocampal injection, we performed time-lapse MRI to detect Mn(2+) transport. Three dimensional whole brain datasets were compared on a voxel-wise basis using within-group pair-wise analysis. Quantification of transport to structures connected to injection sites via axonal fiber tracts was also performed. Histology confirmed consistent placement of hippocampal injections and no observable difference in glial-response to the injections. APP-/- mice had significantly reduced transport from the hippocampus to the septal nuclei and amygdala after 7h and reduced transport to the contralateral hippocampus after 25 h; axonal transport deficits in the APP-/- animals were also identified in the visual pathway. These data support a system-wide role for APP in axonal transport within the central nervous system and demonstrate the power of MEMRI for assessing neuronal circuitry involved in memory and learning."

The imbalance between production and clearance of amyloid β (Aβ) is a very early, often initiating factor in AD. Dendrobium nobile Lindl. alkaloids (DNLA) extracted from a Chinese medicinal herb, which have been shown to have anti-aging effects, protected against neuronal impairment in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we confirmed that DNLA can improve learning and memory function in elderly normal mice, indicating that DNLA has potential health benefits. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Therefore, we further explored the effect of DNLA on neurons, which is closely related to learning and memory, based on Aβ.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We exposed cultured hippocampal neurons to DNLA to investigate the effect of DNLA on Aβ in vitro.

            "abstract": "During the last 25 years, neuropathological, biochemical, genetic, cell biological and even therapeutic studies in humans have all supported the hypothesis that the gradual cerebral accumulation of soluble and insoluble assemblies of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in limbic and association cortices triggers a cascade of biochemical and cellular alterations that produce the clinical phenotype of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The reasons for elevated cortical Abeta42 levels in most patients with typical, late-onset AD are unknown, but based on recent work, these could turn out to include augmented neuronal release of Abeta during some kinds of synaptic activity. Elevated levels of soluble Abeta42 monomers enable formation of soluble oligomers that can diffuse into synaptic clefts. We have identified certain APP-expressing cultured cell lines that form low-n oligomers intracellularly and release a portion of them into the medium. We find that these naturally secreted soluble oligomers--at picomolar concentrations--can disrupt hippocampal LTP in slices and in vivo and can also impair the memory of a complex learned behavior in rats. Abeta trimers appear to be more potent in disrupting LTP than are dimers. The cell-derived oligomers also decrease dendritic spine density in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, and this decrease can be prevented by administration of Abeta antibodies or small-molecule modulators of Abeta aggregation. This therapeutic progress has been accompanied by advances in imaging the Abeta deposits non-invasively in humans. A new diagnostic-therapeutic paradigm to successfully address AD and its harbinger, mild cognitive impairment-amnestic type, is emerging."

Patients were separated into four individual subgroups as to the presence of FoF and falls (i.e., fearless/non-fallers, fearless/fallers, FoF/non-fallers and FoF/fallers). The Falls Efficacy Scale International questionnaire was used to assess the level of concern of falling. Participants were defined as \"fallers\" and \"non-fallers\" based on their fall history. Spatio-temporal parameters of gait were analyzed using an electronic mat. Cognitive performance was assessed by a computerized cognitive battery of tests. The study included 540 MS patients, 47% were defined as fallers and 61.9% reported a FoF. Non-significant differences were found between the fearless/non-fallers and fearless/fallers in all clinical, gait and cognitive scores. FoF/non-fallers walked significantly slower compared to fearless MS individuals who had previously fallen. Furthermore, the same patient group exhibited a poorer performance in the motor skills cognitive subdomain. A significant reverse relationship was found between FoF and cognitive motor skills in the fallers and non-fallers groups.

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of progressive neurodegenerative disorder, marked by memory loss and a decline in cognitive function. The major hallmarks of AD are the presence of intracellular neurofibrillary tau tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins and extracellular plaques composed of amyloid beta peptides (Aβ). The amyloid (Aβ) cascade hypothesis proposes that the AD pathogenesis is initiated by the accumulation of Aβ peptides in the parenchyma of the brain. An aspartyl intramembranal protease called γ-secretase is responsible for the production of Aβ by the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Clinical studies of γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) for AD failed due to the lack of substrate specificity. Therefore, γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed as potential disease modifying agents to modulate the γ-secretase cleavage activity towards the production of toxic Aβ42 peptides. Following the first-generation 'nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug' (NSAID) based GSMs, second-generation GSMs (carboxylic acid based NSAID derivatives and non-NSAID derived heterocyclic analogues), as well as natural product-based GSMs, have been developed. In this review, we focus on the recent developments of small molecule-based GSMs that show potential improvements in terms of drug-like properties as well as their current status in human clinical trials and the future perspectives of GSM research."

This study aimed to develop a leisure activity scale for contemporary older adults and examine its psychometric properties, based on a previous study from Iwasa et al. (2018). As people who actively engage in leisure activities are reportedly less likely to experience cognitive decline, the relationship between the scale score and cognitive function should be assessed while developing the scale. Specifically, the study was conducted to examine the reliability of the scale and its factor structure, confirm basic statistical characteristics, examine the scale's gender- and age-based differences, and the relationship between the scale score and cognitive function.Methods We surveyed Japanese older adults living in a community (aged 70-84 years; N=594) and used data from 306 participants (151 men and 155 women). We developed and administered a scale comprising 11 items that were measured using a 4-point Likert-type scale. Additionally, we used cognitive function scales including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Memory Impairment Screen (MIS), and the Word Fluency Test. Covariates in tests for independent associations between the leisure activity scale score and cognitive function were socioeconomic status, chronic disease, functional capacity, and living alone. We conducted two web surveys with two-week intervals for test-retest reliability purposes and used data from 192 of those participants (aged 70-79 years; 101 men and 91 women).Results A confirmatory factor analysis upheld the fact that the scale was comprised of one factor. The scale obtained high indicators of reliability: Cronbach's alpha coefficient (0.81) and test-retest reliability (0.81). The mean, standard deviation, median, skewness, and kurtosis of the scale score were 14.44, 7.13, 15, -0.12, and -0.73, respectively. The analysis of variance for the scale score indicated significant age-based differences (i.e., the score for those who were 70-74 years old was higher than for those who were 80-84 years old) and no significant gender differences. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that the scale score was significantly and independently correlated with MMSE (β=0.31), MIS (β=0.24), and word fluency (β=0.25).Conclusion This study confirmed the psychometric properties of the leisure activity scale, including factor structure, reliability, basic statistical characteristics, no gender differences, significant age-based differences, and relationship to cognitive function. Future studies should examine the longitudinal relationship between the leisure activity scale score and cognition among older adults in community settings."

It is no wonder that miRNAs are implicated in multiple clinical conditions, allowing us to establish the hubs and nodes for network models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). AD is an age-related, progressive, irreversible, and multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive and memory impairment and is the most common cause of dementia in older adults. Worldwide, around 50 million people have dementia, and there are nearly 10 million new cases every year. δ-secretase, also known as asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) or legumain (LGMN), is a lysosomal cysteine protease that cleaves peptide bonds C-terminally to asparagine residues in both amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau, mediating the amyloid-β and tau pathology in AD. The patient's miRNA expression was found to be deregulated in the brain, extracellular fluid, blood plasma, and serum.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks of LGMN or δ-secretase were constructed using the Genemania database.

Starbase v2.0 and miRanda were used for screening miRNA of LGMN genes. Moreover, to understand the regulatory mechanism in AD, we have screened major transcription factors of LGMN targeted genes using the Network Analyst 3.0, TRRUST (v2.0) server, and ENCODE. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and BEST tool were used to investigate the expression pattern of the LGMN gene. In parallel, we performed in-silico drug designing of the novel inhibitor scaffold of δ-secretase as powerful therapeutic targets by using the concept of scaffolds and frameworks. In this context, this study also aimed at identifying effective small molecule inhibitors targeting δ-secretase.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Among the 16 experimentally verified miRNAs, Network analysis of the LGMN and its associated miRNA identify novel hsa-miRNA-106a-5p and hsa-miRNA-34a-5p being more expressed in the brain. Our in silico high throughput screening, followed by XP docking revealed Oprea1 as the lead. Molecular dynamic simulations of the δ-secretase-docked complex have been carried out for a time period of 200 ns and revealed that Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of the protein Cα-backbone with respect to its starting position increased to 1.20 Å for the first 25 ns of the trajectory and then became stable around 0.6 Å in the last 170 ns course of the simulation.

Higher concentrations of IL1β in DS may reflect an increased vulnerability to infections and/or an increased prevalence of autoimmune disorders, while the positive association between IL1β and t-tau in DS may indicate IL1β is associated with neurodegeneration.

Current treatments as well as novel strategies, such as targeting the perisynaptic environment and use of virtual reality, are addressed. We review research on the subjective experience of fear and the role of autobiographical memory in fear-related disorders. We also discuss the gaps in our understanding of fear learning and memory, and the degree of consensus in the field. Lastly, the development of linguistic tools for assessments and treatment of fear learning and memory disorders is discussed."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Vitamins and minerals have many functions in the nervous system which are important for brain health. It has been suggested that various different vitamin and mineral supplements might be useful in maintaining cognitive function and delaying the onset of dementia. In this review, we sought to examine the evidence for this in people who already had mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on cognitive function and the incidence of dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's (CDCIG) specialised register, as well as MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, LILACs, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP, from inception to 25 January 2018.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised or quasi-randomised, placebo-controlled trials which evaluated orally administered vitamin or mineral supplements in participants with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and which assessed the incidence of dementia or cognitive outcomes, or both. We were interested in studies applicable to the general population of older people and therefore excluded studies in which participants had severe vitamin or mineral deficiencies.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We sought data on our primary outcomes of dementia incidence and overall cognitive function and on secondary outcomes of episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, quality of life, functional performance, clinical global impression, adverse events, and mortality. We conducted data collection and analysis according to standard Cochrane systematic review methods. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We grouped vitamins and minerals according to their putative mechanism of action and, where we considered it to be clinically appropriate, we pooled data using random-effects methods. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of evidence for each comparison and outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included five trials with 879 participants which investigated B vitamin supplements. In four trials, the intervention was a combination of vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid; in one, it was folic acid only. Doses varied. We considered there to be some risks of performance and attrition bias and of selective outcome reporting among these trials. Our primary efficacy outcomes were the incidence of dementia and scores on measures of overall cognitive function. None of the trials reported the incidence of dementia and the evidence on overall cognitive function was of very low-quality. There was probably little or no effect of B vitamins taken for six to 24 months on episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, or quality of life. The evidence on our other secondary clinical outcomes, including harms, was very sparse or very low-quality. There was evidence from one study that there may be a slower rate of brain atrophy over two years in participants taking B vitamins. The same study reported subgroup analyses based on the level of serum homocysteine (tHcy) at baseline and found evidence that B vitamins may improve episodic memory in those with tHcy above the median at baseline.We included one trial (n = 516) of vitamin E supplementation. Vitamin E was given as 1000 IU of alpha-tocopherol twice daily. We considered this trial to be at risk of attrition and selective reporting bias. There was probably no effect of vitamin E on the probability of progression from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia over three years (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.41; n = 516; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence). There was also no evidence of an effect at intermediate time points. The available data did not allow us to conduct analyses, but the authors reported no significant effect of three years of supplementation with vitamin E on overall cognitive function, episodic memory, speed of processing, clinical global impression, functional performance, adverse events, or mortality (five deaths in each group). We considered this to be low-quality evidence.We included one trial (n = 256) of combined vitamin E and vitamin C supplementation and one trial (n = 26) of supplementation with chromium picolinate. In both cases, there was a single eligible cognitive outcome, but we considered the evidence to be very low-quality and so could not be sure of any effects.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The evidence on vitamin and mineral supplements as treatments for MCI is very limited. Three years of treatment with high-dose vitamin E probably does not reduce the risk of progression to dementia, but we have no data on this outcome for other supplements. Only B vitamins have been assessed in more than one RCT. There is no evidence for beneficial effects on cognition of supplementation with B vitamins for six to 24 months. Evidence from a single study of a reduced rate of brain atrophy in participants taking vitamin B and a beneficial effect of vitamin B on episodic memory in those with higher tHcy at baseline warrants attempted replication."

            "abstract": "Standardized extracts of Bacopa monniera (BME) have been shown to exert a neuroprotective effect against mental diseases, such as depression, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease (AD), in chronic administration studies. However, its mechanism of action has remained unclear. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of Bacopaside I (BS-I), a major triterpenoid saponin of BME, on the cognitive impairment and neuropathology in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and explored the possible mechanism from a biological systems perspective. We found that BS-I treatment significantly ameliorated learning deficits, improved long-term spatial memory, and reduced plaque load in APP/PS1 mice. We constructed BS-I's therapeutic effect network by mapping the nodes onto the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network constructed according to their functional categories based on genomic and proteomic data. Because many of the top enrichment categories related to the processes of the immune system and phagocytosis were detected, we proposed that BS-I promotes amyloid clearance via the induction of a suitable degree of innate immune stimulation and phagocytosis. Our research may help to clarify the neuroprotective effect of BME and indicated that natural saponins target the immune system, which may offer new research avenues to discover novel treatments for AD."

AD ultimately leads to a severe loss of mental function. Due to lack of effective biomarkers, no effective medication was available for the complete treatment of AD. There is a need to provide all AD-related essential information to the scientific community. Our resource Alzheimer's disease Biomarkers Comprehensive Database (ABCD) is being planned to accomplish this objective. ABCD is a huge collection of AD-related data of molecular markers. The web interface contains information concerning the proteins, genes, transcription factors, SNPs, miRNAs, mitochondrial genes, and expressed genes implicated in AD pathogenesis. In addition to the molecular-level data, the database has information for animal models, medicinal candidates and pathways involved in the AD and some image data for AD patients. ABCD is coupled with some major external resources where the user can retrieve additional general information about the disease. The database was designed in such a manner that user can extract meaningful information about gene, protein, pathway, and regulatory elements based search options. This database is unique in the sense that it is completely dedicated to specific neurological disorder i.e. AD. Further advance options like AD-affected brain image data of patients and structural compound level information add values to our database. Features of this database enable users to extract, analyze and display information related to a disease in many different ways.

However, training individuals to use the notebook on a regular basis requires a constant delivery of reminders. In this work, we design and evaluate machine learning-based methods for providing automated reminders using a digital memory notebook interface. Specifically, we identify transition periods between activities as times to issue prompts. We consider the problem of detecting activity transitions using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, and find that both techniques show promising results for detecting transition periods. We test the techniques in a scripted setting with 15 individuals. Motion sensors data is recorded and annotated as participants perform a fixed set of activities. We also test the techniques in an unscripted setting with 8 individuals. Motion sensor data is recorded as participants go about their normal daily routine. In both the scripted and unscripted settings a true positive rate of greater than 80% can be achieved while maintaining a false positive rate of less than 15%. On average, this leads to transitions being detected within 1 minute of a true transition for the scripted data and within 2 minutes of a true transition on the unscripted data."

            "abstract": "Elderly people affected by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) usually report a perceived decline in cognitive functions that deeply impacts their quality of life. This subtle waning, although it cannot be diagnosable as dementia, is noted by caregivers on the basis of their relative's behaviors. Crucially, if this condition is also not detected in time by clinicians, it can easily turn into dementia. Thus, early detection of MCI is strongly needed. Classical neuropsychological measures - underlying a categorical model of diagnosis - could be integrated with a dimensional assessment approach involving Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). VR can be used to create highly ecologically controlled simulations resembling the daily life contexts in which patients' daily instrumental activities (IADL) usually take place. Clinicians can record patients' kinematics, particularly gait, while performing IADL (Digital Biomarkers). Then, Artificial Intelligence employs Machine Learning (ML) to analyze them in combination with clinical and neuropsychological data. This integrated computational approach would enable the creation of a predictive model to identify specific patterns of cognitive and motor impairment in MCI. Therefore, this new dimensional cognitive-behavioral assessment would reveal elderly people's neural alterations and impaired cognitive functions, typical of MCI and dementia, even in early stages for more time-sensitive interventions."

We collected 36 studies that used VR to provide clinical trials or therapies for patients with psychiatric disorders. In order to gain a better understanding of the management of pain and stress, we first investigate VR applications for patients to alleviate pain and stress during immersive activities in a virtual environment. VR exposure therapies are particularly effective for anxiety, provoking realistic reactions to feared stimuli. On top of that, exposure therapies with simulated images are beneficial for patients with psychiatric disorders such as phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Moreover, VR environments have shown the possibility of changing depression, cognition, even social functions. We review empirical evidence from VR-based treatments on psychiatric illnesses such as dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), schizophrenia and autism. Through cognitive training and social skill training, rehabilitation through VR therapies helps patients to improve their quality of life. Recent advances in VR technology also demonstrate potential abilities to address cognitive and functional impairments in dementia. In terms of the different types of VR systems, we discuss the feasibility of the technology within different stages of dementia as well as the methodological limitations. Although there is room for improvement, its widespread adoption in psychiatry is yet to occur due to technical drawbacks such as motion sickness and dry eyes, as well as user issues such as preoccupation and addiction. However, it is worth mentioning that VR systems relatively easily deliver virtual environments with well-controlled sensory stimuli. In the future, VR systems may become an innovative clinical tool for patients with specific psychiatric symptoms."

In this study, gene expression (microarray) data from postmortem brains in normal aged as well as AD-affected brains in conjunction with transcriptional regulatory networks were explored for etiological insights. The focus was on the hippocampus, a brain region key to memory and learning. The transcriptional regulatory networks were inferred using a trees-based (random forests or extra-trees) as well as a mutual information-based algorithm applied to compendia of adult mouse whole brain and hippocampus microarray data. Network nodes representing human orthologs of the mouse networks were used in the subsequent analysis. Among the potential transcriptional regulators tied to insulin or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (INS1, INS2, BDNF), whose peptide products have been linked to AD, is the Retinoic Acid Receptor-Related Orphan Receptor (RORA). RORA is a nuclear receptor transcription factor whose expression is distinctly upregulated in the AD hippocampus. A notable cross-section of genes differentially expressed in the AD hippocampus was found to be linked to RORA in the networks. Furthermore, several genes associated with RORA in the networks, such as APP, DNM1L, and TIA1 have been implicated in AD. Computationally-derived clusters and modules within the networks indicated strong ties between RORA and genes involved in the AD etiology. In addition, a functional mapping scheme using activity and interaction data affirmed the same network links to RORA. Thus, RORA emerges as a gene with a probable central role in the AD pathology/etiology."

            "abstract": "Older adults residing in long term care (LTC) settings commonly experience apathy, a neuropsychiatric condition with adverse consequences of increased morbidity and mortality. Activities that combine social, physical and cognitive stimuli are most effective in engaging older adults with apathy but are time consuming and require significant staff resources. We present the results from an initial pilot field study of our socially assistive robotic (SAR) system, Ro-Tri, capable of multi-modal interventions to foster social interaction between pairs of older adults. Seven paired participants attended two sessions a week for three weeks. Sessions consisted of robot-mediated triadic interactions with three types of activities repeated once over the 3 weeks. Ro-Tri gathered quantitative interaction data, head pose, vocal sound, and physiological signals to automatically evaluate older adults' activity and social engagement. Ro-Tri functioned smoothly without any technical issues. Older adults had > 90% attendance and 100% completion rate and remained engaged with the system throughout the study duration. Participants' visual attention toward the SAR system and their partners increased 7.2% and 4.7%, respectively, with their interaction effort showing an increase of 2.9%. Older adults and LTC staff had positive perceptions with the system. These initial results demonstrate Ro-Tri's ability to engage older adults, encourage social human-to-human interaction, and assess the changes using quantitative metrics. Future studies will determine SAR's impact on apathy in LTC older adults."

            "abstract": "Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects the brain non-uniformly, causing hippocampal memory deficits long before wide-spread brain degeneration becomes evident. Here we addressed whether mossy fiber inputs from the dentate gyrus onto CA3 principal cells are affected in an AD mouse model before amyloid β plaque deposition. We recorded from CA3 pyramidal cells in a slice preparation from 6-month-old male APP/PS1 mice, and studied synaptic properties and intrinsic excitability. In parallel we performed a morphometric analysis of mossy fiber synapses following viral based labeling and 3D-reconstruction. We found that the basal structural and functional properties as well as presynaptic short-term plasticity at mossy fiber synapses are unaltered at 6 months in APP/PS1 mice. However, transient potentiation of synaptic transmission mediated by activity-dependent release of lipids was abolished. Whereas the presynaptic form of mossy fiber long-term potentiation (LTP) was not affected, the postsynaptic LTP of NMDAR-EPSCs was reduced. In addition, we also report an impairment in feedforward inhibition in CA3 pyramidal cells. This study, together with our previous work describing deficits at CA3-CA3 synapses, provides evidence that early AD affects synapses in a projection-dependent manner at the level of a single neuronal population.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Because loss of episodic memory is considered the cognitive hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is important to study whether synaptic circuits involved in the encoding of episodic memory are compromised in AD mouse models. Here we probe alterations in the synaptic connections between the dentate gyrus and CA3, which are thought to be critical for enabling episodic memories to be formed and stored in CA3. We found that forms of synaptic plasticity specific to these synaptic connections are markedly impaired at an early stage in a mouse model of AD, before deposition of β amyloid plaques. Together with previous work describing deficits at CA3-CA3 synapses, we provide evidence that early AD affects synapses in an input-dependent manner within a single neuronal population."

            "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is one of the main causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The presence of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in senile plaques (SP) of AD suggests that it plays a role in AD pathogenesis. ATP5A1 (F1F0-ATP synthase F1 α subunit) is abundant in SP. Further, the protein has recently been found to have an anti-infection role in zebrafish embryos. In the present study, we observed that LPS levels were higher in the brains of APP/PS1 mice than in control mice, and LPS co-localised with ATP5A1 in amyloid plaques. The interaction of recombinant ATP5A1(rATP5A1) and LPS was evidenced by cellular thermal shift assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding assay in vitro. Neuroinflammation in the brain of a mouse model was induced by intracerebroventricular injection of LPS. The addition of rATP5A1 relieved LPS-induced reduction of spontaneous locomotor ability, depressive-like behaviour, and working memory impairment. Furthermore, rATP5A1 suppressed the activation of astrocytes and microglia, IL-1β accumulation, and tau phosphorylation induced by LPS. Taken together, findings suggest that ATP5A1 is involved in the regulation of LPS-mediated neuroinflammation in AD."

            "abstract": "The etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains elusive. The \"amyloid\" hypothesis states that toxic action of accumulated β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) on synaptic function causes AD cognitive decline. This hypothesis is supported by analysis of familial AD (FAD)-based transgenic mouse models, where altered amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing leads to Aβ accumulation correlating with hippocampal-dependent memory deficits. Some studies report prominent dentate gyrus (DG) glutamatergic plasticity alterations in these mice, while CA1 plasticity remains relatively unaffected. The \"neurotrophic unbalance\" hypothesis, on the other hand, states that AD-related loss of cholinergic signaling and altered APP processing are due to alterations in nerve growth factor (NGF) trophic support. This hypothesis is supported by analysis of the AD11 mouse, which exhibits chronic NGF deprivation during adulthood and displays AD-like pathology, including Aβ accumulation and hippocampal-dependent memory deficits. In this study, we analyzed CA1 and DG glutamatergic plasticity in AD11 mice to evaluate whether these mice also share with FAD models a common phenotype in hippocampal synaptic dysfunction. We report that AD11 mice display age-dependent short- and long-term DG plasticity deficits, while CA1 plasticity remains relatively spared. We also report that both structures exhibit enhanced glutamatergic transmission under lower, yet physiological, neurotransmitter release conditions, a defect that should be considered when further evaluating hippocampal synaptic deficits underlying AD pathology. We conclude that severe deficits in DG plasticity represent another common denominator between these two etiologically different types of AD mouse models, independent of the initial insult (overexpression of FAD mutation or NGF deprivation)."

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial disease involving many pathological mechanisms. Nonetheless, single pathogenic mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) or presenilin 1 or 2 can cause AD with almost all of the clinical and neuropathological features, and therefore, we believe an important mechanism of pathogenesis in AD could be revealed from examining pathogenic APP missense mutations. A comprehensive review of the literature, including clinical, neuropathological, cellular and animal model data, was conducted through PubMed and the databases of Alzforum mutations, HGMD, UniProt, and AD&FTDMDB. Pearson correlation analysis combining the clinical and neuropathological data and aspects of mutant APP processing in cellular models was performed. We find that an increase in Aβ42 has a significant positive correlation with the appearance of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and tends to cause an earlier age of AD onset, while an increase in Aβ40 significantly increases the age at death. The increase in the α-carboxyl terminal fragment (CTF) has a significantly negative correlation with the age of AD onset, and β-CTF has a similar effect without statistical significance. Animal models show that intracellular Aβ is critical for memory defects. Based on these results and the fact that amyloid plaque burden correlates much less well with cognitive impairment than do NFT counts, we propose a \"snowball hypothesis\": the accumulation of intraneuronal NFTs caused by extracellular Aβ42 and the increase in intraneuronal APP proteolytic products (CTFs and Aβs) could cause cellular organelle stress that leads to neurodegeneration in AD, which then resembles the formation of abnormal protein \"snowballs\" both inside and outside of neurons."

            "abstract": "In Alzheimer disease (AD) patients, degeneration of the cholinergic system utilizing acetylcholine for memory acquisition is observed. Since AD therapy using acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are only palliative for memory deficits without slowing or reversing disease progress, there is a need for effective therapies, and stem cell-based therapeutic approaches targeting AD should fulfill this requirement. We established a human neural stem cell (NSC) line encoding choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) gene, an acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme. APPswe/PS1dE9 AD model mice transplanted with the F3.ChAT NSCs exhibited improved cognitive function and physical activity. Transplanted F3.ChAT NSCs in the AD mice differentiated into neurons and astrocytes, produced ChAT protein, increased the ACh level, and improved the learning and memory function. F3.ChAT cell transplantation reduced Aβ deposits by recovering microglial function; i.e., the down-regulation of β-secretase and inflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of Aβ-degrading enzyme neprilysin. F3.ChAT cells restored growth factors (GFs) and neurotrophic factors (NFs), and they induced the proliferation of NSCs in the host brain. These findings indicate that NSCs overexpressing ChAT can ameliorate complex cognitive and physical deficits of AD animals by releasing ACh, reducing Aβ deposit, and promoting neuroregeneration by the production of GFs/NFs. It is suggested that NSCs overexpressing ChAT could be a candidate for cell therapy in advanced AD therapy."

The aim of this report was to examine the extent to which objectively assessed cognitive performance has been used as an eligibility and/or stratification criterion in CIAS pharmacotherapy trials. On 16th January 2019, we conducted a systematic search of studies listed on ClinicalTrials.gov to identify randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on pharmacotherapy trials conducted in patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, in which a paper-and-pencil or computerized cognitive task (or battery) was specified as a primary outcome measure. Of the 87 trials that met our inclusion criteria, 10 (11.5%) required the presence of an objectively assessed cognitive deficit as part of their patient eligibility criteria. No studies reported stratifying patients according to the presence or degree of cognitive impairment they exhibited. These results suggest that the vast majority of CIAS trials may have been underpowered due to the inclusion of cognitively \"normal\" patients.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the time course of cognitive function recovery after sedation with propofol and remifentanil. A prospective observational double blind clinical study conducted in 34 young healthy adults undergoing elective outpatient colonoscopy under sedation with the combination of propofol and remifentanil using a target controlled infusion system. Cognitive function was measured using a validated battery of computerized cognitive tests (Cogstate™, Melbourne, Australia) at different predefined times: prior to starting sedation (Tbaseline), and then 10 min (T10), 40 min (T40) and 120 min (T120) after the end of colonoscopy. Tests included the assessment of psychomotor function, attention, visual memory and working memory. All colonoscopies were completed (median time: 26 min) without significant adverse events. Patients received a median total dose of propofol and remifentanil of 149 mg and 98 µg, respectively. Psychomotor function and attention declined at T10 but were back to baseline values at T40 for all patients. The magnitude of psychomotor task reduction was large (d = 0.81) however 100% of patients were recovered at T40. Memory related tasks were not affected 10 min after ending sedation. Cognitive impairment in attention and psychomotor function after propofol and remifentanil sedation was significant and large and could be easily detected by computerized cognitive tests. Even though, patients were fully recovered 40 min after ending the procedure.

The immediate cure is not a possible solution, at least at the moment, but science has found a number of new ways to retard and under specific conditions to halt its development. A potential, and constantly evolving scientific field is the use of Computerized Cognitive Rehabilitation (CCR) and Virtual Environments (Vr.E). According to the existing literature, subjecting patients to various neuro-rehabilitative conditions within 3D virtual environments, allows them to obtain significant therapeutic benefits in which both transferability and durations over time are observed, in relation to the training period of the intervention. In the present study we examine whether \"Serious Games (SGs)\" - (learning and rehabilitating games in virtual and augmented reality) - have utilitarian value in the field of cognitive neurorehabilitation, concerned with demented population. For research purposes, we have conducted a number of case studies, based on 10 elderly patients, suffering from moderate or mild severity impairment of higher cortical functions, attributed to various types of dementias (Vascular, Alzheimer's disease, DLB dementia and mixed dementia). Each participant underwent rehabilitative intervention through our SG for a total of 10 hours within 4-5 weeks period. At the end of the cognitive rehabilitation program, patients' performance was assessed based in standard neuropsychological tests (measuring: working memory, memory retention, attention, problem solving, rigid thinking and executive function) and the results were compared with measurements taken before, during, and at the end of the intervention. Our experimental hypothesis states that there will be a significant difference between the results of cognitive performance of the patients between the pre- and post- rehabilitative period, consequential of the Interactive Computer-based Training (ICT). In conclusion, a review and brief analysis of the relevant literature was carried out in order to investigate the specification of potentially beneficial variables and to appreciate as much as possible the multifactorial causes related to this particular rehabilitation method of the corresponding suffering population. The ultimate purpose of our research is the design and creation of a prospective interactive cognitive rehabilitation training SG, able to combine both the neuro-rehabilitative character of the controlled virtual environment, as well as the potential realism that is also attributed to it (factual validity under high experimental realism). The results showed a relative improvement in the total of the cognitive variables under consideration after the completion of the neuro-rehabilitative program, while a parallel review of the literature on the subject revealed methodological considerations similar to those of the present study."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Depression is known to negatively impact social functioning, with patients commonly reporting difficulties maintaining social relationships. Moreover, a large body of evidence suggests poor social functioning is not only present in depression but that social functioning is an important factor in illness course and outcome. In addition, good social relationships can play a protective role against the onset of depressive symptoms, particularly in late-life depression. However, the majority of research in this area has employed self-report measures of social function. This approach is problematic, as due to their reliance on memory, such measures are prone to error from the neurocognitive impairments of depression, as well as mood-congruent biases.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Narrative review based on searches of the Web of Science and PubMed database(s) from the start of the databases, until the end of 2015.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The present review provides an overview of the literature on social functioning in (late-life) depression and discusses the potential for new technologies to improve the measurement of social function in depressed older adults. In particular, the use of wearable technology to collect direct, objective measures of social activity, such as physical activity and speech, is considered.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In order to develop a greater understanding of social functioning in late-life depression, future research should include the development and validation of more direct, objective measures in conjunction with subjective self-report measures.

            "abstract": "Stroke is a major cause of cognitive impairments. New technologies such as virtual reality and mobile apps have opened up new possibilities of neuropsychological assessment and intervention. This paper reports a controlled study assessing cognitive functioning through a mobile virtual reality application. Fifteen stroke patients recruited from a rehabilitation hospital and 15 healthy control subjects underwent neuropsychological evaluation with traditional paper-and-pencil tests as well as with a pilot version of the Systemic Lisbon Battery (SLB). The criterion validity was the performance of stroke patients vs. healthy controls - which was lower both on the neuropsychological tests and on the SLB for patients. The pattern of correlations between neuropsychological tests and the SLB sub-tests for the respective dimensions showed overall moderate correlations in the predicted directions. We conclude that the SLB applications were able to discriminate the dimensions that they were designed to assess."

            "abstract": "Neural stem cells (NSCs) are capable of self-renewal and are multipotent. Transplantation of NSCs may represent a promising approach for treating neurodegenerative disorders associated with cognitive decline, such as Alzheimer disease (AD) characterized by extensive loss of neurons. In this study, we investigated the effect of NSC transplantation on cognitive function in the amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mouse, an AD mouse model with age-dependent cognitive deficits. We found that NSCs bilaterally transplanted into hippocampal regions improved spatial learning and memory function in these mice, but did not alter Aβ pathology. Immunohistochemical analyses determined that NSCs proliferated, migrated, and differentiated into three neuronal cell types. The improvement in cognitive function was correlated with enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) and an increase in the neuron expression of proteins related to cognitive function: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 2B unit, synaptophysin (SYP), protein kinase C ζ subtypes (PKCζ), tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Taken together, our data indicated that injected NSCs can rescue cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by replacing neuronal cell types expressing multiple cognition-related proteins that enhance LTP."

The earliest and most common symptom of MCI is impaired episodic memory. When episodic memory is impaired in MCI patients, specific functional changes occur in related brain areas. However, there is currently a lack of a unified conclusion on this change. Therefore, the purpose of this meta-analysis is to find MRI-specific functional changes in episodic memory in MCI patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Based on three commonly used indicators of brain function: functional connectivity (FC), the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation /fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF/fALFF), and regional homogeneity (ReHo), we systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science and Ovid related literature and conducted the strict screening.

            "abstract": "Present evidence suggests that the use of virtual reality has great advantages in evaluating visuospatial navigation and memory for the diagnosis of psychiatric or other neurological disorders. There are a few virtual reality studies on allocentric and egocentric memories in schizophrenia, but studies on both memories in bipolar disorder are lacking. The objective of this study was to compare the performance of allocentric and egocentric memories in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. For this resolve, an advanced virtual reality navigation task (VRNT) was presented to distinguish the navigational performances of these patients. Twenty subjects with schizophrenia and 20 bipolar disorder patients were compared with 20 healthy-matched controls on the newly developed VRNT consisting of a virtual neighbourhood (allocentric memory) and a virtual maze (egocentric memory). The results demonstrated that schizophrenia patients were significantly impaired on all allocentric, egocentric, visual, and verbal memory tasks compared with patients with bipolar disorder and normal subjects. Dissimilarly, the performance of patients with bipolar disorder was slightly lower than that of control subjects in all these abilities, but no significant differences were observed. It was concluded that allocentric and egocentric navigation deficits are detectable in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using VRNT, and this task along with RAVLT and ROCFT can be used as a valid clinical tool for distinguishing these patients from normal subjects."

Methods: A qualitative study was conducted between January and March 2019. Ten adults with memory loss, eight carers and six volunteer staff were recruited from two memory cafes, located in Cornwall, UK. There were 19 VR sessions which were audio recorded and all participants were interviewed at the end of the sessions. Framework analysis was used to identify patterns and themes in the data. Results: During the VR experience, participants were engaged to varying degrees, with engagement facilitated by the researcher, and in some cases, with the help of a carer. Participants responded positively to the nature scenes, finding them soothing and evoking memories. The VR experience was positive; many felt immersed in nature and saw it as an opportunity to 'go somewhere'. However, it was not always positive and for a few, it could be 'strange'. Participants reflected on their experience of the VR equipment, and volunteer staff and carers also shared their perceptions of VR for people with dementia in long-term care settings. Conclusions: The VR nature experience was an opportunity for people with memory loss to be immersed in nature and offered the potential to enhance their quality of life. Future work should build on lessons learned and continue to work with people with dementia in developing and implementing VR technology in long-term care settings."

The screen for cognitive impairment in psychiatry (SCIP) test is a validated paper-and-pencil instrument for the assessment of cognition in affective disorders.

The aims of this feasibility study were to perform the following tasks among healthy individuals: (1) evaluate the usability of the ICAT, (2) investigate the feasibility of the ICAT as a patient-administered cognitive assessment tool, and (3) examine the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for the assessment of verbal recall.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The ICAT was developed in a user-centered design process. The cognitive measures of the ICAT were immediate and delayed recall, working memory, and psychomotor speed. Usability and feasibility studies were conducted separately with 2 groups of healthy individuals (N=21 and N=19, respectively). ICAT tests were available in the English and Danish languages. The participants were asked to fill in the post study system usability questionnaire (PSSUQ) upon completing the ICAT test. Verbal recall in the ICAT was assessed using ASR, and the performance evaluation criterion was word error rate (WER). A Pearson 2-tailed correlation analysis significant at the .05 level was applied to investigate the association between the SCIP and ICAT scores.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The overall psychometric factors of PSSUQ for both studies gave scores above 4 (out of 5).

There were also moderate to strong correlations between the SCIP and ICAT subtests for immediate verbal recall (r=0.67; P=.002) and psychomotor speed (r=0.71; P=.001). The associations between the respective subtests for working memory, executive function, and delayed recall, however, were not statistically significant.

There was good accuracy of the ASR for verbal memory assessment. The moderate correlation between the ICAT and SCIP scores suggests that the ICAT is a valid tool for assessing cognition, although this should be confirmed in a larger study with greater statistical power. Taken together, the ICAT seems to be a valid Web-based cognitive assessment tool that, after some minor modifications and further validation, may be used to screen for cognitive impairment in clinical settings."

This effect is hypothesized to reflect awake quiescence, like sleep, being conducive to the consolidation and integration of new spatial memories. Sleep has been shown to improve cognitive map accuracy over time. It remained unknown whether awake quiescence can induce similar time-related improvements in new cognitive maps, or whether it simply counteracts their decay. We examined this question via two experiments. In Experiment 1, using an established cognitive mapping paradigm, we reveal that map accuracy for a virtual town was significantly better in people whose memory was probed after 10 min of post-navigation awake quiescence or ongoing cognitive engagement, relative to those whose memory was probed shortly after initial navigation. In Experiment 2, using a newly developed cognitive mapping task that involved a more complex and real-life virtual town, we again found that map accuracy was superior in those whose memory was probed after 10 min of awake quiescence than those who were tested soon after navigation. These findings indicate that actual improvements in human memories are not restricted to sleep. Thus, contrary to conventional wisdom and theories, the passage of (day)time need not always result in forgetting."

The accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) is considered to be a hallmark of AD. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), also known as beta secretase is the initiating enzyme in the amyloidogenic pathway. Blocking BACE1 could reduce the amount of Aβ, but this would also prohibit the other functions of BACE1 in brain physiological activity. SPONDIN1 (SPON1) is known to bind to the BACE1 binding site of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and blocks the initiating amyloidogenesis. Here, we show the effect of SPON1 in Aβ reduction in vitro in neural cells and in an in vivo AD mouse model. We engineered mouse induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) to express Spon1. iNSCs harboring mouse Spon1 secreted SPON1 protein and reduced the quantity of Aβ when co-cultured with Aβ-secreting Neuro 2a cells. The human SPON1 gene itself also reduced Aβ in HEK 293T cells expressing the human APP transgene with AD-linked mutations through lentiviral-mediated delivery. We also demonstrated that injecting SPON1 reduced the amount of Aβ and ameliorated cognitive dysfunction and memory impairment in 5xFAD mice expressing human APP and PSEN1 transgenes with five AD-linked mutations."

Innovative, complex, and engaging non-pharmacological methods of cognitive stimulation, implementable at this stage, are needed. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of Computerized Cognitive Training (CCT) combined with Whole Body Stimulation (WBC) on cognitive functions of older adults with SCD and MCI. Methods: A 9-week single-blind pre/post case control trial was conducted. The study enrolled 84 adults aged 60 or older, allocated to one of two intervention groups: EG; CCT with psychoeducation, EG2; CCT with psychoeducation and 10 WBC sessions, or the control group (CG), which comprised patients receiving usual care. The primary outcome measures were cognitive functions evaluated with MoCA scale and several other neuropsychological tools. Depressive symptoms assessed with the GDS scale constituted the secondary outcome measures. Results: The results show evidence for increased performance in the assessment of general cognitive functioning in both EGs (p ≤ 0.05). Significant improvement was also visible in several cognitive domains, such as verbal fluency (EG1 & EG2), learning ability and immediate memory (EG1 & EG2), delayed memory (EG2), attentional control (EG1), and information processing (EG2) (p ≤ 0.05). However, only in the group with combined interventions (CCT + WBC) the participants presented significantly less depressive symptoms (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusions: The results of the study suggest that CCT, especially in combination with WBC, might be a practical and effective method of improving cognitive performance.

Treatment of 10-month-old APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice with YM344031 (50 mg/kg, b.i.d.) for two months resulted in dramatic decreases in β-amyloid deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation and synaptic loss in the forebrain, significant attenuation of microgliosis and astrogliosis, and marked improvement of spatial learning and memory performance compared with the vehicle-treated mice. These results support CCR3 antagonism as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD."

The need for cognitive functional capacity tools validated for use in PD clinical and research applications has thus been emphasized in the literature. The Virtual Reality Functional Capacity Assessment Tool (VRFCAT-SL) is a tablet-based instrument that assesses proficiency for performing real world tasks in a highly realistic environment.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The present study explored application of the VRFCAT-SL in clinical assessments of patients with PD. Specifically, we examined associations between VRFCAT-SL performance and measures of cognition, motor severity, and self-reported cognitive functioning.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The VRFCAT-SL was completed by a sample of 29 PD patients seen in clinic for a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. Fifteen patients met Movement Disorders Society Task Force criteria for mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI); no patients were diagnosed with dementia. Non-parametric correlations between VRFCAT-SL performance and standardized neuropsychological tests and clinical measures were examined.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      VRFCAT-SL performance was moderately associated with global rank on neuropsychological testing and discriminated PD-MCI. Follow-up analyses found completion time was associated with visual memory, sustained attention, and set-switching, while errors were associated with psychomotor inhibition. No clinical or motor measures were associated with VRFCAT-SL performance. Self-report was not associated with VRFCAT-SL or neuropsychological test performance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The VRFCAT-SL appears to provide a useful measure of cognitive functional capacity that is not confounded by PD motor symptoms. Future studies will examine utility in PD dementia."

            "abstract": "Space radiation represents a significant health risk for astronauts. Ground-based animal studies indicate that space radiation affects neuronal functions such as excitability, synaptic transmission, and plasticity, and it may accelerate the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although protons represent the main constituent in the space radiation spectrum, their effects on AD-related pathology have not been tested. We irradiated 3 month-old APP/PSEN1 transgenic (TG) and wild type (WT) mice with protons (150 MeV; 0.1-1.0 Gy; whole body) and evaluated functional and biochemical hallmarks of AD. We performed behavioral tests in the water maze (WM) before irradiation and in the WM and Barnes maze at 3 and 6 months post-irradiation to evaluate spatial learning and memory. We also performed electrophysiological recordings in vitro in hippocampal slices prepared 6 and 9 months post-irradiation to evaluate excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity. Next, we evaluated amyloid β (Aβ) deposition in the contralateral hippocampus and adjacent cortex using immunohistochemistry. In cortical homogenates, we analyzed the levels of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin by Western blotting and measured pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL10 and CCL2) by bead-based multiplex assay. TG mice performed significantly worse than WT mice in the WM. Irradiation of TG mice did not affect their behavioral performance, but reduced the amplitudes of population spikes and inhibited paired-pulse facilitation in CA1 neurons. These electrophysiological alterations in the TG mice were qualitatively different from those observed in WT mice, in which irradiation increased excitability and synaptic efficacy. Irradiation increased Aβ deposition in the cortex of TG mice without affecting cytokine levels and increased synaptophysin expression in WT mice (but not in the TG mice). Although irradiation with protons increased Aβ deposition, the complex functional and biochemical results indicate that irradiation effects are not synergistic to AD pathology."

At the same time, there is a substantial need to validate these tools in real-life settings. The primary aim of this study was thus to evaluate the feasibility, validity, and reliability of mobile app-based tasks for assessing cognitive function in a population-based sample of older adults.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A total of 172 non-demented (Clinical Dementia Rating 0 and 0.5) older participants (aged 76-77) completed two mobile app-based memory tasks-the Mnemonic Discrimination Task for Objects and Scenes (MDT-OS) and the long-term (24 h) delayed Object-In-Room Recall Task (ORR-LDR). To determine the validity of the tasks for measuring relevant cognitive functions in this population, we assessed relationships with conventional cognitive tests. In addition, psychometric properties, including test-retest reliability, and the participants' self-rated experience with mobile app-based cognitive tasks were assessed.\n    \n\n\n          Result:\n        \n      \n      MDT-OS and ORR-LDR were weakly-to-moderately correlated with the Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC5) (r = 0.3-0.44, p < .001) and with several other measures of episodic memory, processing speed, and executive function. Test-retest reliability was poor-to-moderate for one single session but improved to moderate-to-good when using the average of two sessions. We observed no significant floor or ceiling effects nor effects of education or gender on task performance. Contextual factors such as distractions and screen size did not significantly affect task performance. Most participants deemed the tasks interesting, but many rated them as highly challenging. While several participants reported distractions during tasks, most could concentrate well. However, there were difficulties in completing delayed recall tasks on time in this unsupervised and remote setting.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our study proves the feasibility of mobile app-based cognitive assessments in a community sample of older adults, demonstrating its validity in relation to conventional cognitive measures and its reliability for repeated measurements over time. To further strengthen study adherence, future studies should implement additional measures to improve task completion on time."

To determine the influence of such diseases, find therapeutic effects and further improve quality of life, cognitive assessment and training is required. This can be done with the application of high immersive technologies like virtual reality.In this paper we evaluate the feasibility of an electromyography (EMG) arm muscle-motion based interaction technique for controlling a VR cognitive performance diagnostic and training environment. Therefore, we compared the state-of-theart controller input to our EMG based approach in terms of presence and user experience.Results show significant differences in terms of Novelty and Dependability. Since there are only few significant differences regarding presence and user experience, the advantage of applying a more demanding physical motion interaction approach (EMG), seems to be a promising method with the potential of having a positive effect on the cognitive training progress. This is mainly caused by the fact that the implemented gesture interaction reinforces the connection between decision making and action execution."

The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, the gene ontology (GO) was enriched and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG pathway) were analyzed. Cytoscape 3.7.1 software was used to construct a target-signaling pathway network of RES in the treatment of AD. Molecular docking verification was carried out on SwissDock (http://www.swissdock.ch/docking). We examined a 293Tau cell model of AD for changes in protein levels of pS396, pS199, Tau5, CDK5, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and p-GSK3β in response to RES treatment using Western blotting.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We obtained 182 targets of RES, 525 targets related to AD, and 36 targets of RES for AD treatment, among which 34.6% of the targets were protein-modifying enzymes, 27.7% were metabolite invertase, 13.8% were gene-specific transcriptional regulators, and 10.3% were transporters. The core key targets of RES in the treatment of AD included INS, APP, ESR1, MMP9, IGF1R, CACNA1C, MAPT (microtubule- associated protein Tau), MMP2, TGFB1 and GSK3B. Enrichment analysis of GO biological process suggested that the biological function of RES in AD treatment mainly involved the response to β-amyloid protein, positive regulation of transferase activity, the transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, regulation of behavior, learning or memory, aging, and transmembrane transport. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the most significantly enriched signaling pathways were AD pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. Molecular docking results showed that RES had strong binding with ESR1, GSK3B, MMP9, IGF1R, APP and INS.

APOB-100 hypertriglyceridemic model is a useful tool to study the link between cerebrovascular pathology and neurodegeneration, while APP-PSEN1 humanized mouse is a model of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the current study was to characterize the inflammatory changes in the brain with healthy aging and in neurodegeneration. Also, the cerebro-morphological and cognitive alterations have been investigated. The nose-to-brain delivery of a P-glycoprotein substrate model drug (quinidine) was monitored in the disease models and compared with the age-matched controls. Our results revealed an inflammatory balance shift in both the healthy aged and neurodegenerative models. In normal aging monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, stem cell factor and Rantes were highly upregulated indicating a stimulated leukocyte status. In APOB-100 mice, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) were induced (vascular reaction), while in APP-PSEN1 mice resistin, IL-17A and GM-CSF were mostly upregulated. The nasal drug absorption was similar in the brain and blood indicating the molecular bypass of the BBB. The learning and memory tests showed no difference in the cognitive performance of healthy aged and young animals. Based on these results, it can be concluded that various markers of chronic inflammation are present in healthy aged and diseased animals. In APOB-100 mice, a cerebro-ventricular dilation can also be observed.

            "abstract": "Authentic rehabilitation requires the active participation of patients and their involvement with opportunities for action and development. Within this framework, in this article we outline the possibility of using two emerging computing and communication technologies-ambient intelligence (AmI) and virtual reality (VR)--for a new breed of rehabilitative and clinical applications based on a strategy defined as transformation of flow. Transformation of flow is a person's ability to exploit an optimal (flow) experience to identify and use new and unexpected psychological resources as sources of involvement. We identify the feeling of presence--the feeling of being in a world that exists outside oneself--as the theoretical link between the technology and rehabilitation. AmI and VR are used to trigger broad empowerment processes induced by a strong sense of presence, leading to greater agency and control over one's actions and environment."

Significant time-by-group interactions were also found for the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Paired Associates Learning first trial memory score (P=.002), Mini-Mental State Examination (P=.036), the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (P=.032), and the Apathy Evaluation Scale (P=.026). Within-group comparisons revealed highly specific effects of cognitive training on episodic memory. The cognitive training group maintained high levels of enjoyment and motivation to continue after each hour of gameplay, with self-confidence and self-rated memory ability improving over time.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nEpisodic memory robustly improved in the cognitive training group. \"Gamified\" cognitive training may also enhance visuospatial abilities in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Gamification maximizes engagement with cognitive training by increasing motivation and could complement pharmacological treatments for amnestic mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease.

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterized by irreversible cognitive impairment, memory loss and behavioral disturbances, ultimately leading to death. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase1A (DYRK1A) have gained a lot of attention for its role in tau pathology. To search for potential dual GSK-3β/DYRK1A inhibitors, we focused on harmine, a natural β-carboline alkaloid, which has been extensively studied for its various biological effects on the prevention of AD. In this study, a new series of harmine derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as dual GSK-3β/DYRK1A inhibitors for their multiple biological activities. The in vitro results indicated that most of them displayed promising activity against GSK-3β and DYRK1A. Among them, compound ZDWX-25 showed potent inhibitory effects on GSK-3β and DYRK1A with IC50 values of 71 and 103 nM, respectively. Molecular modelling and kinetic studies verified that ZDWX-25 could interact with the ATP binding pocket of GSK-3β and DYRK1A. Western blot analysis revealed that ZDWX-25 inhibited hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in okadaic acid (OKA)-induced SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, ZDWX-25 showed good blood-brain barrier penetrability in vitro. More importantly, ZDWX-25 could ameliorate the impaired learning and memory in APP/PS1/Tau transgenic mice. These results indicated that the harmine-based compounds could be served as promising dual-targeted candidates for AD."

This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of VR intervention on cognition and motor function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Methods: Seven databases were systematically searched for relevant articles published from inception to April 2020. Randomized controlled trials examining VR intervention in adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia aged >60 years were included. The primary outcome of the study was cognitive function, including overall cognition, global cognition, attention, executive function, memory, and visuospatial ability. The secondary outcome was motor function, consisting of overall motor function, balance, and gait. A subgroup analysis was also performed based on study characteristics to identify the potential factors for heterogeneity. Results: Eleven studies including 359 participants were included for final analysis. Primary analysis showed a significant moderate positive effect size (ES) of VR on overall cognition (g = 0.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.31-0.59; P < 0.001), attention/execution (g = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.26-0.72; P < 0.001), memory (g = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.29-0.85; P < 0.001), and global cognition (g = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.06-0.58; P = 0.02). Secondary analysis showed a significant small positive ES on overall motor function (g = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.05-0.51; P = 0.018). The ES on balance (g = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.06-0.80; P = 0.02) was significant and moderate. The ES on visuospatial ability and gait was not significant. In the subgroup analysis, heterogeneity was detected in type of immersion and population diagnosis. Conclusions: VR intervention is a beneficial non-pharmacological approach to improve cognitive and motor function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, especially in attention/execution, memory, global cognition, and balance. VR intervention does not show superiority on visuospatial ability and gait performance."

Virtual reality (VR) in the form of head-mounted displays (HMDs) is a fully immersive technology that provides access to a wide range of freely available content. The use of VR as a therapy tool has demonstrated promise in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety.

A simple and reliable bedside test of these functions would be extremely relevant for diagnostic routine. Pointing at targets in the 3D environment is a basic well-trained common sensorimotor ability that provides a suitable measure. We here describe a smartphone-based pointing device using the built-in inertial sensors for analysis of pointing performance in azimuth and polar spatial coordinates. Interpretation of the vectors measured in this way is not trivial, since the individuals tested may use at least two different strategies: first, they may perform the task in an egocentric eye-based reference system by aligning the fingertip with the target retinotopically or second, by aligning the stretched arm and the index finger with the visual line of sight in allocentric world-based coordinates similar to using a rifle. The two strategies result in considerable differences of target coordinates. A pilot test with a further developed design of the device and an app for a standardized bedside utilization in five healthy volunteers revealed an overall mean deviation of less than 5° between the measured and the true coordinates. Future investigations of neurological patients comparing their performance before and after changes in body position (chair rotation) may allow differentiation of distinct orientational deficits in peripheral (vestibulopathy) or central (hippocampal or cortical) disorders."

            "abstract": "It has long been assumed that β-amyloid (Aβ) had to assemble into fibrillar amyloid plaques to exert its neurotoxic effects in Alzheimer disease. An alternative hypothesis is that soluble oligomers ofAβ play a much larger role in neuronal damage than the insoluble component. We have tested these competing hypotheses in vivo by studying the clinicopathologic correlates of oligomeric Aβ species and classic fibrillar amyloid plaques in the brains of double-transgenic APP-tau mice up to 17 months of age. Biochemical and immunohistochemical measures of brain oligomeric Aβ exponentially increased with age. Oligomeric Aβ load correlated with morphological markers of fibrillar Aβ deposition. In contrast to total amyloid plaque burden, the amount of oligomeric Aβ deposits labeled by the conformational epitope-specific antibody Nab61 closely correlated with neuronal loss and numbers of astrocytes in the entorhinal cortex and the CA1 hippocampal subfield. However, like other morphological Aβ measurements, brain oligomeric Aβ burden did not correlate well with memory deficits in these mice. The number of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes in entorhinal cortex and CA1 most tightly correlated with memory impairment and neuronal cell loss. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the astrocyte response, which is likely triggered by brain oligomeric Aβ accumulation, adversely affects cognition and might also contribute to neuronal cell death in this model."

            "abstract": "The study of human movement and biomechanics forms an integral part of various clinical assessments and provides valuable information toward diagnosing neurodegenerative disorders where the motor symptoms predominate. Conventional gait and postural balance analysis techniques like force platforms, motion cameras, etc., are complex, expensive equipment requiring specialist operators, thereby posing a significant challenge toward translation to the clinics. The current manuscript presents an overview and relevant literature summarizing the umbrella of factors associated with neurodegenerative disorder management: from the pathogenesis and motor symptoms of commonly occurring disorders to current alternate practices toward its quantification and mitigation. This article reviews recent advances in technologies and methodologies for managing important neurodegenerative gait and balance disorders, emphasizing assessment and rehabilitation/assistance. The review predominantly focuses on the application of inertial sensors toward various facets of gait analysis, including event detection, spatiotemporal gait parameter measurement, estimation of joint kinematics, and postural balance analysis. In addition, the use of other sensing principles such as foot-force interaction measurement, electromyography techniques, electrogoniometers, force-myography, ultrasonic, piezoelectric, and microphone sensors has also been explored. The review also examined the commercially available wearable gait analysis systems. Additionally, a summary of recent progress in therapeutic approaches, viz., wearables, virtual reality (VR), and phytochemical compounds, has also been presented, explicitly targeting the neuro-motor and functional impairments associated with these disorders. Efforts toward therapeutic and functional rehabilitation through VR, wearables, and different phytochemical compounds are presented using recent examples of research across the commonly occurring neurodegenerative conditions [viz., Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]. Studies exploring the potential role of Phyto compounds in mitigating commonly associated neurodegenerative pathologies such as mitochondrial dysfunction, α-synuclein accumulation, imbalance of free radicals, etc., are also discussed in breadth. Parameters such as joint angles, plantar pressure, and muscle force can be measured using portable and wearable sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, footswitches, force sensors, etc. Kinetic foot insoles and inertial measurement tools are widely explored for studying kinematic and kinetic parameters associated with gait. With advanced correlation algorithms and extensive RCTs, such measurement techniques can be an effective clinical and home-based monitoring and rehabilitation tool for neuro-impaired gait. As evident from the present literature, although the vast majority of works reported are not clinically and extensively validated to derive a firm conclusion about the effectiveness of such techniques, wearable sensors present a promising impact toward dealing with neurodegenerative motor disorders."

New etiological models suggest that cognitive difficulties might not be directly linked to seizure activity, but are rather a manifestation of a broader brain pathology. Consequently, treating seizures is not sufficient to alleviate cognitive symptoms, highlighting the need for novel diagnostic tools. Here, we investigated whether the organization of three intrinsic, resting-state functional connectivity networks was correlated with domain-specific cognitive test performance. Using individualized EEG source reconstruction and graph theory, we examined the association between network small worldness and cognitive test performance in 23 patients with focal epilepsy and 17 healthy controls, who underwent a series of standardized pencil-and-paper and digital cognitive tests. We observed that the specific networks robustly correlated with test performance in distinct cognitive domains. Specifically, correlations were evident between the default mode network and memory in patients, the central-executive network and executive functioning in controls, and the salience network and social cognition in both groups. Interestingly, the correlations were evident in both groups, but in different domains, suggesting an alteration in these functional neurocognitive networks in focal epilepsy. The present findings highlight the potential clinical relevance of functional brain network dysfunction in cognitive impairment."

Rural caregivers are particularly vulnerable, but they have limited access to CBT-I; therefore, we developed an accessible digital version using community input (NiteCAPP CARES).\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This trial will evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and short-term and long-term effects of NiteCAPP CARES on the sleep and stress mechanisms underlying poor caregiver health and functioning.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Dyads (n=100) consisting of caregivers with chronic insomnia and their coresiding persons with dementia will be recruited from Columbia and surrounding areas in Missouri, United States. Participant dyads will be randomized to 4 weeks (plus 4 bimonthly booster sessions) of NiteCAPP CARES or a web-based sleep hygiene control (NiteCAPP SHARES). Participants will be assessed at baseline, after treatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. The following assessments will be completed by caregivers: 1 week of actigraphy and daily diaries measuring sleep, Insomnia Severity Index, arousal (heart rate variability), inflammation (blood-derived biomarkers: interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein), neurodegeneration (blood-derived biomarkers: plasma amyloid beta [Aβ40 and Aβ42], total tau, and phosphorylated tau [p-tau181 and p-tau217]), cognition (Joggle battery, NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function, and Cognitive Failures Questionnaire), stress and burden, health, and mood (depression and anxiety). Persons with dementia will complete 1 week of actigraphy at each time point.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Recruitment procedures started in February 2022. All data are expected to be collected by 2026. Full trial results are planned to be published by 2027. Secondary analyses of baseline data will be subsequently published.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This randomized controlled trial tests NiteCAPP CARES, a web-based CBT-I for rural caregivers. The knowledge obtained will address not only what outcomes improve but also how and why they improve and for how long, which will help us to modify NiteCAPP CARES to optimize treatment potency and support future pragmatic testing and dissemination.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04896775; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04896775.\n    \n\n\n          International registered report identifier (irrid):\n        \n      \n      PRR1-10.2196/37874."

We investigated the associations between sex, smoking, and cardiovascular disease with verbal learning and memory function. Using MindCrowd, an observational web-based cohort of ~ 70,000 people aged 18-85, we investigated whether sex modifies the relationship between smoking and cardiovascular disease with verbal memory performance. We found significant interactions in that smoking is associated with verbal learning performance more in women and cardiovascular disease more in men across a wide age range.

Our data show that quercetin decreases extracellular β-amyloidosis, tauopathy, astrogliosis and microgliosis in the hippocampus and the amygdala. These results were supported by a significant reduction in the paired helical filament (PHF), β-amyloid (βA) 1-40 and βA 1-42 levels and a decrease in BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP (into CTFβ). Additionally, quercetin induced improved performance on learning and spatial memory tasks and greater risk assessment behavior based on the elevated plus maze test.

If not recognized early, it inevitably develops into vascular dementia. Several quantitative studies have reported the consistent results of brain regions in sVCI patients that can be used to predict dementia conversion. The purpose of the study was to explore the exact abnormalities within the brain in sVCI patients by combining the coordinates reported in previous studies. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were thoroughly searched to obtain neuroimaging articles on the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, regional homogeneity, and functional connectivity in sVCI patients. According to the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm, a meta-analysis based on coordinate and functional connectivity modeling was conducted. Results: The quantitative meta-analysis included 20 functional imaging studies on sVCI patients. Alterations in specific brain regions were mainly concentrated in the frontal lobes including the middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, and precentral gyrus; parietal lobes including the precuneus, angular gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule; occipital lobes including the lingual gyrus and cuneus; temporal lobes including the fusiform gyrus and middle temporal gyrus; and the limbic system including the cingulate gyrus. These specific brain regions belonged to important networks known as the default mode network, the executive control network, and the visual network. Conclusion: The present study determined specific abnormal brain regions in sVCI patients, and these brain regions with specific changes were found to belong to important brain functional networks. The findings objectively present the exact abnormalities within the brain, which help further understand the pathogenesis of sVCI and identify them as potential imaging biomarkers. The results may also provide a basis for new approaches to treatment."

Spatial navigation is a complex skill that involves multiple types of information processing and integration. Place cells and grid cells, collectively with other hippocampal and medial entorhinal cortex neurons (MEC), form a neural network whose activity is critical for the representation of self-position and orientation along with spatial memory retrieval. Furthermore, this activity generates new representations adapting to changes in the environment. Though there is a normal decline in spatial memory related to aging, this is dramatically increased in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a multi-factorial neurodegenerative disorder affecting mainly the hippocampus-entorhinal cortex (HP-EC) circuit. Consequently, the initial stages of the disease have disorientation and wandering behavior as two of its hallmarks. Recent electrophysiological studies have linked spatial memory deficits to difficulties in spatial information encoding. Here we will discuss map impairment and remapping disruption in the HP-EC network, as a possible circuit mechanism involved in the spatial memory and navigation deficits observed in AD, pointing out the benefits of virtual reality as a tool for early diagnosis and rehabilitation."

            "abstract": "Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with dysfunctional insulin signaling and energy metabolism. Emerging evidence suggests impairments in brain insulin responsiveness, glucose utilization, and energy metabolism may be major causes of amyloid precursor protein mishandling. The support for this notion comes from the studies wherein streptozotocin (STZ) induced brain insulin resistance in rodent model resulted in sAD-like neuropathology with cognitive decline. Our previous study showed a compromised insulin signaling pathway, glucose uptake, glucose metabolism, and energy homeostasis in STZ-induced glial-neuronal coculture and in vivo model of sAD. Various components of insulin signaling pathway were examined to understand the metabolic correlation, and GSK3β was selected for gene knockdown strategy to reverse sAD pathology based on the data. In the present study, we have synthesized carboxylated graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets functionalized with PEG and subsequently with polyethylenimine (PEI) to provide attachment sites for GSK3β siRNA. Our results showed that siRNA mediated knockdown of the GSK3β gene reduced expression of amyloid pathway genes (APP and BACE1), which was further confirmed by reduced amyloid beta (Aβ) levels in the in vitro STZ-induced sAD model. GSK3β knockdown also restored insulin signaling, AMPK and Mapk3 pathway by restoring the expression of corresponding candidate genes in these pathways (IR, Glut1/3, Prkaa1/2, Mapk3, BDNF) that reflected improved cellular energy homeostasis, neuronal proliferation, differentiation, maturation, and repair. Behavioral data from Morris water maze (MWM), open field (OF), novel object recognition (NOR), Y maze, and radial arm maze (RAM) tests showed that 0.5 μg nanoformulation (GOc-PP-siRNAGSK3β) intranasally for 7 days improved spatial memory, rescued anxiety like behavior, improved visual and working memory, and rescued exploratory behavior in STZ-induced sAD rats. GSK3β silencing resulted in decreased BACE1 expression and prevented accumulation of Aβ in the cortex and hippocampus. These molecular findings with improved behavioral performances were further correlated with reduced amyloid beta (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangle (NFTs) formation in the cortex and hippocampus of GOc-PP-siRNAGSK3β administered sAD rats. Therefore, it is conceivable from the present study that nanoparticle-mediated targeting of GSK3β in the sAD appears to be a promising strategy to reverse sAD pathology."

            "abstract": "Vascular dysfunctions, hypometabolism, and insulin resistance are high and early risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a leading neurological disease associated with memory decline and cognitive dysfunctions. Early defects in glucose transporters and glycolysis occur during the course of AD progression. Hypometabolism begins well before the onset of early AD symptoms; this timing implicates the vulnerability of hypometabolic brain regions to beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1) upregulation, oxidative stress, inflammation, synaptic failure, and cell death. Despite the fact that ketone bodies, astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and glycogenolysis compensate to provide energy to the starving AD brain, a considerable energy crisis still persists and increases during disease progression. Studies that track brain energy metabolism in humans, animal models of AD, and in vitro studies reveal striking upregulation of beta-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) and carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs). Currently, the precise role of CTFs is unclear, but evidence supports increased endosomal-lysosomal trafficking of β-APP and CTFs through autophagy through a vague mechanism. While intracellular accumulation of Aβ is attributed as both the cause and consequence of a defective endolysosomal-autophagic system, much remains to be explored about the other β-APP cleavage products. Many recent works report altered amino acid catabolism and expression of several urea cycle enzymes in AD brains, but the precise cause for this dysregulation is not fully explained. In this paper, we try to connect the role of CTFs in the energy translation process in AD brain based on recent findings."

Its goals are to promote rapid communication, research efficiency, and collaborative, multidisciplinary interactions. Introducing new knowledge management approaches to AD research has a potentially large societal value. AD is among the leading causes of disability and death in older people. According to the Alzheimer's Association, four million Americans currently suffer from AD. That number is expected to escalate to over 10 million in coming decades. Patients progress from memory loss to a bedridden state over many years and require near-constant care. In addition to imposing a heavy burden on family caregivers and society at large, AD and related neurodegenerative disorders are among the most complex and challenging in biomedicine. Researchers have produced an abundance of data implicating diverse biological mechanisms. Important factors include genes, environmental risks, changes in cell functions, DNA damage, accumulation of misfolded proteins, cell death, immune responses, changes related to aging, and reduced regenerative capacity. Yet there is no agreement on the fundamental causes of AD. The situations regarding Parkinson, Huntington, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are similar. The challenge of integrating so much data into testable hypotheses and unified concepts is formidable. What is more, basic understanding of these diseases needs to intersect with an equally complex universe of pharmacology, medicinal chemistry, animal studies, and clinical trials. In this chapter, we will describe the approaches developed by Alzforum to achieve knowledge integration through information technology and virtual community-building. We will also propose some future directions in the application of Web-based knowledge management systems in neuromedicine."

We conducted a secondary analysis of a data set including 887 older adults (M age = 72.7 years, SD = 7.1 years; 32.1% male; M years education = 13.4, SD = 2.7 years) with CAMCI scores and independent diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A study by the CAMCI developers used a portion of this data set with a machine learning decision tree model and suggested that the CAMCI had high classification accuracy for MCI (sensitivity = 0.86, specificity = 0.94). We found similar support for accuracy (sensitivity = 0.94, specificity = 0.94) by overfitting a decision tree model, but we found evidence of lower accuracy in a cross-validation sample (sensitivity = 0.62, specificity = 0.66). A logistic regression model, however, discriminated modestly in both training (sensitivity = 0.72, specificity = 0.80) and cross-validation data sets (sensitivity = 0.69, specificity = 0.74). Evidence for strong accuracy when overfitting a decision tree model and substantially reduced accuracy in cross-validation samples was replicated across 500 bootstrapped samples. In contrast, the evidence for accuracy of the logistic regression model was similar in the training and cross-validation samples. The logistic regression model produced accuracy estimates consistent with other published CAMCI studies, suggesting evidence for classification accuracy of the CAMCI for MCI is likely modest. This case study illustrates the general need for cross-validation and careful evaluation of the generalizability of machine learning models.

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is manifested by regional cerebral hypometabolism. Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) is localized in mitochondria and regulates cellular metabolism, but the role of Sirt3 in AD-related hypometabolism remains elusive. We used expression profiling and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to analyze cortical neurons from a transgenic mouse model of AD (APPSwInd). Based on WGCNA results, we measured NAD+ level, NAD+/ NADH ratio, Sirt3 protein level and its deacetylation activity, and ATP production across both in vivo and in vitro models. To investigate the effect of Sirt3 on amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced mitochondria damage, we knocked down and over-expressed Sirt3 in hippocampal cells. WGCNA revealed Sirt3 as a key player in Aβ-related hypometabolism. In APP mice, the NAD+ level, NAD+/ NADH ratio, Sirt3 protein level and activity, and ATP production were all reduced compared to the control. As a result, learning and memory performance were impaired in 9-month-old APP mice compared to wild type controls. Using hippocampal HT22 cells model, Sirt3 overexpression increased Sirt3 deacetylation activity, rescued mitochondria function, and salvaged ATP production, which were damaged by Aβ. Sirt3 plays an important role in regulating Aβ-induced cerebral hypometabolism. This study suggests a potential direction for AD therapy."

            "abstract": "The accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ), denoted as senile plaques, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (formed by hyperphosphorylated Tau protein) in the brain are two major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current and most accepted hypothesis proposes that the oligomerization of Aβ peptides triggers the polymerization and accumulation of amyloid, which leads to the senile plaques. Several strategies have been reported to target Aβ oligomerization/polymerization. Since it is thought that Aβ levels in the brain and peripheral blood maintain equilibrium, it has been hypothesized that enhancing peripheral clearance (by shifting this equilibrium towards the blood) might reduce Aβ levels in the brain, known as the sink effect. This process has been reported to be effective, showing a reduction in Aβ burden in the brain as a consequence of the peripheral reduction of Aβ levels. Nanoparticles (NPs) may have difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), initially due to their size. It is not clear whether particles in the range of 50-100 nm should be able to cross the BBB without being specifically modified for it. Despite the size limitation of crossing the BBB, several NP derivatives may be proposed as therapeutic tools. The purpose of this review is to summarize some therapeutic approaches based on nanoliposomes using two complementary examples: First, unilamellar nanoliposomes containing Aβ generic ligands, such as sphingolipids, gangliosides or curcumin, or some sphingolipid bound to the binding domain of ApoE; and second, nanoliposomes containing monoclonal antibodies against Aβ. Following similar rationale NPs of poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-poly (ethylene glycol) conjugated with curcumin-derivate (PLGA-PEG-B6/Cur) were reported to improve the spatial learning and memory capability of APP/PS1 mice, compared with native curcumin treatment. Also, some new nanostructures such as exosomes have been proposed as a putative therapeutic and prevention strategies of AD. Although the unquestionable interest of this issue is beyond the scope of this review article. The potential mechanisms and significance of nanoliposome therapies for AD, which are still are in clinical trials, will be discussed."

            "abstract": "Present evidence suggests that medial temporal cortices subserve allocentric representation and memory, whereas egocentric representation and memory also depends on parietal association cortices and the striatum. Virtual reality environments have a major advantage for the assessment of spatial navigation and memory formation, as computer-simulated first-person environments can simulate navigation in a large-scale space. Twenty-nine patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) were compared with 29 healthy matched controls on two virtual reality tasks affording to learn a virtual park (allocentric memory) and a virtual maze (egocentric memory). Participants further received a neuropsychological investigation and MRI volumetry at the time of the assessment. Results indicate that aMCI patients had significantly reduced size of the hippocampus bilaterally and the right-sided precuneus and inferior parietal cortex. aMCI patients were severely impaired learning the virtual park and the virtual maze. Smaller volumes of the right-sided precuneus were related to worse performance on the virtual maze. Participants with striatal lacunar lesions committed more errors than participants without such lesions on the virtual maze but not on the virtual park. aMCI patients later converting to dementia (n=15) had significantly smaller hippocampal size when compared with non-converters (n=14). However, both groups did not differ on virtual reality task performance. Our study clearly demonstrates the feasibility of virtual reality technology to study spatial memory deficits of persons with aMCI. Future studies should try to design spatial virtual reality tasks being specific enough to predict conversion from MCI to dementia and conversion from normal to MCI."

Persons with dementia often experience deterioration of cognitive ability, as well as various behavioral and psychological disturbances, which significantly contribute to reduced quality of life and emotional well-being. The demand for long-term care continues to rise rapidly and it is therefore critical to develop effective strategies and evidence-based interventions to improve the quality of life for persons with dementia. Music therapy has drawn attention as a promising non-pharmacological approach for persons with dementia. A variety of music interventions including singing and listening to music have been widely applied for dementia care not only by music therapists, but also by other healthcare professionals. There are, however, little research studies that compare possible effects of music therapy interventions with those of music-based approaches on dementia care. The purpose of the current study was to compare the short-term effects of a music therapy-singing group with those of a music medicine-listening group and a control-TV group, on quality of life and affect of persons with dementia at a long-term care facility. The music therapy-singing group was facilitated by a music therapist, whereas the music medicine-listening and the control-TV group were led by nursing home activity staff. Fifty-two participants, whose ages range from 67 to 99 years old, were randomly assigned to one of the three groups, and 37 participants completed the interventions. The participants in each group were engaged for a 40-min session twice a week for four consecutive weeks.

Chemotherapy has been linked to an array of cognitive impairments and alterations in brain structure and function (\"chemobrain\"). In this review, we summarized the existing evidence that evaluate the changes in cognitive functioning and brain with chemotherapy, as assessed using structural and functional MRI-based techniques in a longitudinal design. This review followed the latest PRISMA guidelines using Embase, Medline, PsychINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases with date restrictions from 2012 to 2017. Fourteen research articles met the key inclusion criteria: (i) the studies involved adult cancer patients (mean age ≥ 18); (ii) the use of chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer; (iii) pre-post assessment of behavioral and brain-based outcomes; and (iv) abstracts written in English. Effect sizes of subjective and objective cognitive impairments from the reviewed studies were estimated using Cohen's d or z-scores. We calculated percentage of mean change or effect sizes for main neuroimaging findings when data were available. Strength of the correlations between brain alterations and cognitive changes was obtained using squared correlation coefficients. Small to medium effect sizes were shown? on individual tests of attention, processing speed, verbal memory, and executive control; and medium effect sizes on self-report questionnaires. Neuroimaging data showed reduced grey matter density in cancer patients in frontal, parietal, and temporal regions. Changes in brain function (brain activation and cerebral blood flow) were observed with cancer across functional networks involving (pre)frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, and cerebellar regions. Data from diffusion-weighted MRI suggested reduced white matter integrity involving the superior longitudinal fasciculus, corpus callosum, forceps major, and corona radiate, and altered structural connectivity across the whole brain network. Finally, we observed moderate-to-strong correlations between worsening cognitive function and morphological changes in frontal brain regions. While MRI is a powerful tool for detection of longitudinal brain changes in the 'chemobrain', the underlying biological mechanisms are still unclear. Continued work in this field will hopefully detect MRI metrics to be used as biomarkers to help guide cognitive treatment at the individual cancer patient level."

A number of types of intervention seek to attenuate or reverse this impairment. The use of computerized tests helps quantify the effects of interventions on cognitive function in the elderly. The objective of the present review was to analyze studies that have utilized computerized cognitive tests to determine the effects of interventions in the elderly population, describing the batteries and tests employed, the populations studied and reports by authors on the limitations or benefits of employing these tests in older adults. The review was performed on the PubMed database using the descriptors: cognitive computerized test and elderly. We retrieved 530 studies and, following analysis of their abstracts, selected 32 relevant to the subject. The studies utilized 19 different types of computerized tests and batteries to assess the interventions, which were predominantly drug trials. There were no reports on limitations in the use of the computerized tests, suggesting this type of intervention had good applicability, sensitivity, and little or no practice effects in this population."

Theoretical articles, review articles, and book chapters that did not include original data were excluded. We identified 151 studies published between 1984 and 2011, of which 38 met inclusion criteria and were further classified into three groups by the type of computerized program used: classic cognitive training tasks, neuropsychological software, and video games. Reported pre-post training effect sizes for intervention groups ranged from 0.06 to 6.32 for classic cognitive training interventions, 0.19 to 7.14 for neuropsychological software interventions, and 0.09 to 1.70 for video game interventions. Most studies reported older adults did not need to be technologically savvy in order to successfully complete or benefit from training. Overall, findings are comparable or better than those from reviews of more traditional, paper-and-pencil cognitive training approaches suggesting that computerized training is an effective, less labor intensive alternative."

We wished to assess and compare the patterns of cerebral loss produced by these two groups of mutations. Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological assessments were performed in individuals with clinical AD carrying mutations in the APP (n = 10) and PSEN1 (n = 18) genes and in healthy controls (n = 18). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM), cortical thickness, and region of interest analyses were performed. Mini-Mental State Examination scores were similar in the two disease groups suggesting similar levels of disease severity. There was evidence that APP subjects have smaller hippocampal volume compared with PSEN1 subjects (p = 0.007), and weak evidence that they have larger whole-brain and grey matter volumes (both p = 0.07). Although there was no evidence of statistically significant differences between APP and PSEN1 in VBM or cortical thickness analyses, effect-maps were suggestive of APP subjects having more medial temporal lobe atrophy and conversely PSEN1 subjects showing more neocortical loss. Neuropsychological data were consistent with these regional differences and suggested greater memory deficits in the APP patients and greater impairment in non-memory domains in the PSEN1 group, although these differences were not statistically significant. We conclude that the mechanisms by which APP and PSEN1 mutations cause neuronal loss may differ which furthers our understanding of the neuropathology underlying AD and may inform future therapeutic strategies and trial designs."

We conducted a systematic review to assess the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions (namely diet, exercise and cognitive training) for T2DM on cognition. A search strategy was constructed and applied to four databases: EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL and Web of Science. Peer-reviewed journal articles in English were considered assessing the effect of exercise, dietary or cognitive training/stimulation-based interventions (or any combination of these) in patients with T2DM on cognition. Results were dual-screened and extracted by two independent reviewers. Of 4820 results, 3782 remained after de-duplication. Forty full-texts were screened and two studies were included in the final review. The first assessed the impact of a 10-year intensive lifestyle intervention on T2DM-related complications (Look-AHEAD study) and the second was a post hoc analysis of T2DM patients from a trial of a physical activity intervention in older non-demented adult with functional limitations (LIFE study). Whilst the Look-AHEAD study found no impact on diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, the LIFE study demonstrated beneficial effects on global cognitive function and delayed memory specifically in older adults with T2DM. There is insufficient evidence to fully assess the effect of non-pharmacological interventions on cognition in T2DM. Well-constructed trials must be designed to specifically assess the effect of non-pharmacological and multi-domain interventions for cognition in patients with T2DM in midlife. All trials examining interventions in T2DM should consider cognition as at least a secondary outcome."

            "abstract": "A treatment of geriatric disorders is one of the current major problems socially as well as medically. Thus nootropics have become one of the biggest topics in drug developments. Unfortunately, it is still very difficult to assess brain dysfunctions and therapeutic efficacies of these drugs objectively. Giurgea has proposed a new drug category, \"nootropic\", as those substances which possess an anti-dementia action, yet the general concept remains obscure. The present author expand the concept that those substances which improve the vigilance level to be included. The author has been engaged with computer assisted pharmaco-electroencephalography and research of nootropics for last several years. Based on the own experiences, the author presented the CNS effects of five different substances such as meclofenoxate, amantadine, piracetam, teniloxazine and WEB-1881, which were regarded as nootropics from various reasons. Single dose of each substances was administered in healthy young volunteers, and teniloxazine was given to geriatric patients. EEG changes induced by these substances in normal subjects were an increase of alpha activity, particularly in higher frequency range above 9.5 Hz, and an associated decrease of slow activity and of fast activity, which are different from those of the other psychotropic drugs. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) of EEG parameters has confirmed that the response of WEB-1881 was most manifest in frontal area. This suggests that WEB-1881 might activate linguistic learning and memory process. In the patient study, the induced EEG changes were an increase of alpha activity associated with a decrease of slow activity, while fast activity did not show any changes. However, the EEG changes in the patient study were quite similar to those of normal volunteer study for the most part. It is relevant to infer the efficacy of nootropics in geriatric patients from acute normal volunteer study. In physiological aging process, alpha activity gradually decreases. The EEG changes induced by nootropics are the reverse of this process, suggesting the antagonistic efficacy in the geriatric changes. Therefore, quantitative pharmaco-EEG is one of the best tools in the screening for the CNS efficacy of nootropic or anti-dementia substance in the meantime."

These two diseases share many common risk factors, including old age, being female, smoking, excessive drinking, low estrogen, and vitamin D3 levels. Additionally, oxidative damage and the dysfunction of the antioxidant system play important roles in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and AD. Aβ not only leads to impaired memory but also plays a crucial role in the demineralization process of bone tissues of older people and women with menopause. Curculigoside can promote calcium deposition and increase the levels of ALP and Runx2 in osteoblasts under oxidative stress via anti-oxidative character. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CUR on the spatial learning and memory by the Morris water maze and brain immunohistochemistry, and bone microstructure and material properties of femurs by micro-computed tomography and mechanical testing in APP/PS1 mutated transgenic mice. Oral administration of CUR can significantly enhance learning performance and ameliorate bone loss in APP/PS1 mutated transgenic mice, and the mechanism may be related to its antioxidant effect.

            "abstract": "Smart health technology includes physical sensors, intelligent sensors, and output advice to help monitor patients' health and adjust their behavior. Virtual reality (VR) plays an increasingly larger role to improve health outcomes, being used in a variety of medical specialties including robotic surgery, diagnosis of some difficult diseases, and virtual reality pain distraction for severe burn patients. Smart VR health technology acts as a decision support system in the diseases diagnostic test of patients as they perform real world tasks in virtual reality (e.g., navigation). In this study, a non-invasive, cognitive computerized test based on 3D virtual environments for detecting the main symptoms of dementia (memory loss, visuospatial defects, and spatial navigation) is proposed. In a recent study, the system was tested on 115 real patients of which thirty had a dementia, sixty-five were cognitively healthy, and twenty had a mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The performance of the VR system was compared with Mini-Cog test, where the latter is used to measure cognitive impaired patients in the traditional diagnosis system at the clinic. It was observed that visuospatial and memory recall scores in both clinical diagnosis and VR system of dementia patients were less than those of MCI patients, and the scores of MCI patients were less than those of the control group. Furthermore, there is a perfect agreement between the standard methods in functional evaluation and navigational ability in our system where P-value in weighted Kappa statistic= 100% and between Mini-Cog-clinical diagnosis vs. VR scores where P-value in weighted Kappa statistic= 93%."

A mixed methods design measured affect and behaviour using the Observed Emotion Rating Scale, Overt Aggression Scale-Modified for Neurorehabilitation and St Andrew's Sexual Behaviour Assessment.

            "abstract": "Background: Newly acquired long-term cognitive impairments are common among survivors of critical illness. They have been linked to the stressful situation that patients experience in the intensive care unit (ICU). In this paper we use virtual reality (VR) technology to comfort critically ill patients and reduce stress during their ICU stay. We investigate the acceptance, comfort, recollection, and visual perception of VR stimulation and how it affects physiological parameters. Methods: A VR head-mounted display was used to present immersive nature scenes to 33 critically ill cardiac surgery patients [mean age 63 years (range 32-83)]. Data was collected with an eye tracker fitted inside the VR head-mounted display to measure eye movements (250 Hz) and sensors to record physiological parameters (240 Hz). Patients received VR stimulation (for 5 min.) prior to ICU admission, during ICU stay, and 3 months after discharge. Acceptance, recollection and comfort were assessed with validated questionnaires. Results: The number of gazed meaningful objects per minute was significantly lower during the ICU session compared to pre- and follow-up sessions, whereas mean duration of fixation on meaningful moving objects did not differ between the sessions. While respiratory rate decreased significantly during VR stimulation, heart rate and blood pressure remained constant. Post-ICU rating of VR acceptance during ICU stay was moderate to high and discomfort low. Recollection of VR was high [28/33 patients (84.8%)], while recollection of ICU stay was low [10/33 patients (30.3%)]. Conclusion: Eye movements indicate that patients were able to perceive and process cognitive stimulation during their ICU stay. VR was recalled better than the rest of the ICU stay and well accepted. Decreased respiratory rate during stimulation indicate a relaxing effect of VR."

This new WM testing application will be available to download for free in Apple Store app (\"SDRST app\"). In order to verify the feasibility of this computer-based task, we conducted three experiments with different manipulations and groups of participants. We were interested in investigating if (1) the SDRST is sensitive enough to tap into cognitive differences brought by aging and dementia; (2) different experimental manipulations work successfully; (3) cortical brain activations seen in other WM tasks are also demonstrated here; and (4) non-human primates are able to answer the task. Performance (scores and response time) was better for young than older adults and higher for the latter when compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. All groups performed better with facial stimuli than with images of scenes and with emotional than with neutral stimuli. Electrophysiology data showed activation on prefrontal and frontal areas of scalp, theta band activity on the midline area, and gamma activity in left temporal area. There are all scalp regions known to be related to attention and WM. Besides those data, our sample of adult captive capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) answered the task above chance level. Taken together, these results corroborate the reliability of this new computer-based SDRST as a measure of visuospatial WM in clinical and non-clinical populations as well as in non-human primates. Its tablet app allows the task to be administered in a wide range of settings, including hospitals, homes, schools, laboratories, universities, and research institutions."

Criterion validity was determined by examining patterns of performance on the CogState tasks in groups of individuals with mild head injury, schizophrenia, and AIDS dementia complex. Each of these groups was impaired on the CogState performance measures (Cohen's d's = -.60 to -1.80) and the magnitude and nature of this impairment was qualitatively and quantitatively similar in each group.

A total of 51 patients with epilepsy (33 males and 18 females) with a mean age of 30.7 ± 12.1 years and 51 age and sex matched controls participated in this study. The cognitive performances of the people with epilepsy and controls were assessed using the Community Screening Interview for Dementia (CSID) and the computerized cognitive assessment test battery, the FePsy. The control group performed better in almost all the neurocognitive tests compared with the low seizure frequency (LSF) and high seizure frequency (HSF) groups. Analysis of covariance revealed that patients with LSF performed better (p = 0.04) in visual reaction time - dominant hand (VRT-D) compared with the HSF group. There was lack of significant differences in mean total CSID scores and mean sub-total scores for language, memory, orientation, attention, constructional praxis, auditory reaction time-dominant hand and non-dominant hand, VRT - non-dominant hand and figure recognition. HSF patients indicated significantly greater prevalence (80% vs. 20%; p = 0.020) and risk (OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 1.8-33.8)) of memory impairment, but not in the other neurocognitive domains compared with the LSF group. In conclusion, the present study indicated that adults with epilepsy performed poorly in a wide range of neurocognitive variables compared with the controls. However, no significant adverse effects of high seizure frequency were observed on almost all the neurocognitive variables."

            "abstract": "Astrocytes and apolipoprotein E (apoE) play critical roles in cognitive function, not only under physiological conditions but also in some pathological situations, particularly in the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The regulatory mechanisms underlying the effect of apoE, derived from astrocytes, on cognitive deficits during AD pathology development are unclear. In this study, we generated amyloid precursor protein/apoE knockout (APP/apoEKO) and APP/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-apoEKO mice (the AD mice model used in this study was based on the APP-familial Alzheimer disease overexpression) to investigate the role of apoE, derived from astrocytes, in AD pathology and cognitive function. To explore the mechanism, we investigated the amyloidogenic process related transforming growth factor β/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (TGF-β/Smad2/STAT3) signaling pathway and further confirmed by administering TGF-β-overexpression adeno-associated virus (specific to astrocytes) to APP/GFAP-apoEKO mice and TGF-β-inhibition adeno-associated virus (specific to astrocytes) to APP/WT mice. Whole body deletion of apoE significantly ameliorated the spatial learning and memory impairment, reduced amyloid β-protein production and inhibited astrogliosis in APP/apoEKO mice, as well as specific deletion apoE in astrocytes in APP/GFAP-apoEKO mice. Moreover, amyloid β-protein accumulation was increased due to promotion of amyloidogenesis of APP, and astrogliosis was upregulated by activation of TGF-β/Smad2/STAT3 signaling. Furthermore, the overexpression of TGF-β in astrocytes in APP/GFAP-apoEKO mice abrogated the effects of apoE knockout. In contrast, repression of TGF-β in astrocytes of APP/WT mice exerted a therapeutic effect similar to apoE knockout. These data suggested that apoE derived from astrocytes contributes to the risk of AD through TGF-β/Smad2/STAT3 signaling activation. These findings enhance our understanding of the role of apoE, derived from astrocytes, in AD and suggest it to be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for AD."

Additional information on deaths was collected from the General Mortality Register (GMR) and the Special Mortality Register collated by the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths (np-SAD).\n    \n\n\n          Review methods:\n        \n      \n      Studies were categorised according to design, with systematic research syntheses (Level I evidence) the most valid and least open to bias. Where Level I evidence was not available, controlled observational studies (Level II evidence) were systematically reviewed. If neither Level I nor Level II evidence was available, uncontrolled case series and case reports (Level III evidence) were systematically surveyed. Data were extracted by one reviewer and a sample checked by a second. The heterogeneity of Level II evidence was addressed by undertaking stratified analyses for current and former ecstasy users and comparing them either with control groups using other illegal drugs but not ecstasy (polydrug controls) or with controls naïve to illegal drugs (drug-naïve controls). Statistical heterogeneity was minimised by using a random-effects model throughout and investigated using study-level regression analysis (metaregression).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Five Level I syntheses were identified; for each it was difficult to ascertain the exact methods adopted and evidence included. Small but significant deficits for ecstasy users compared to controls were reported in areas relating to attention, memory, psychomotor speed, executive systems functioning, and self-reported depressive symptoms. Data from Level II studies were directly pooled for seven individual outcomes, suggesting that ecstasy users performed worse than controls on common measures of immediate and delayed verbal recall (RAVLT, RBMT, digit span). No difference was seen in IQ (NART). The 915 outcome measures identified in Level II studies were analysed in broad domains: immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory, working memory, two measures of attention, three measures of executive function, perceptual organisation, self-rated depression, memory and anxiety, and impulsivity measured objectively and subjectively. Ecstasy users performed significantly worse than polydrug controls in 13/16 domains and significantly worse than drug-naïve controls in 7/12 domains for which sufficient data were available. The largest, most consistent exposure effects were seen in meta-analyses of memory (especially verbal and working memory, with less marked effects seen in visual memory). Former ecstasy users frequently showed deficits that matched or exceeded those seen amongst current users. At aggregate level, the effects do not appear to be dose-related, but are variably confounded by other drug use, particularly alcohol. Of Level III evidence, in the 10 years to 2006, the np-SAD and the GMR recorded an average of around 50 drug-related deaths per year involving ecstasy; it was the sole drug implicated in around 10 cases per year. Retrospective case series, based on hospital emergency department records, reported a death rate of 0-2% from emergency admissions related to ecstasy. Two major syndromes are most commonly reported as the immediate cause of death in fatal cases: hyperthermia and hyponatraemia.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A broad range of relatively low-quality literature suggests that recreational use of ecstasy is associated with significant deficits in neurocognitive function (particularly immediate and delayed verbal memory) and increased psychopathological symptoms. The clinical significance of the exposure effect in individual cases will be variable but, on average, deficits are likely to be relatively small. Ecstasy is associated with a range of acute harms but appears to be a rare cause of death in isolation."

            "abstract": "Along with deficits in spatial cognition, a decline in body-related information is observed in aging and is thought to contribute to impairments in navigation, memory, and space perception. According to the embodied cognition theories, bodily and environmental information play a crucial role in defining cognitive representations. Thanks to the possibility to involve body-related information, manipulate environmental stimuli, and add multisensory cues, virtual reality is one of the best candidates for spatial memory rehabilitation in aging for its embodied potential. However, current virtual neurorehabilitation solutions for aging and neurodegenerative diseases are in their infancy. Here, we discuss three concepts that could be used to improve embodied representations of the space with virtual reality. The virtual bodily representation is the combination of idiothetic information involved during virtual navigation thanks to input/output devices; the spatial affordances are environmental or symbolic elements used by the individual to act in the virtual environment; finally, the virtual enactment effect is the enhancement on spatial memory provided by actively (cognitively and/or bodily) interacting with the virtual space and its elements. Theoretical and empirical findings will be presented to propose innovative rehabilitative solutions in aging for spatial memory and navigation."

Although exposure therapy is an effective treatment for this disorder, some personnel do not significantly respond to treatment, possibly due to poor activation of the trauma memory or a lack of emotional engagement during therapy. In addition, some service members do not seek mental healthcare due to treatment stigma. Researchers recently developed a virtual reality (VR) Iraq to attempt to improve activation of the traumatic memory during exposure therapy and to provide a treatment approach that may be more appealing to some service members, relative to traditional face-to-face talk therapy. Initial validation of the application requires an assessment of how well it represents the experiences of previously deployed service members. This study evaluated the realism of the VR Iraq application according to the subjective evaluation of 93 U.S. Army soldiers who returned from Iraq in the last year. Those screening negative for PTSD used and evaluated a VR tactical convoy and a VR dismounted patrol in a simulated Middle Eastern city. Results indicated that 86% of soldiers rated the overall realism of the VR convoy as ranging from adequate to excellent. Eighty-two percent of soldiers reported adequate-to-excellent overall realism of the city environment. Results provide evidence that the VR Iraq presents a realistic context in which VR exposure therapy can be conducted. However, clinical trials are needed to assess the efficacy of VR exposure therapy for Iraq veterans with PTSD."

Using mixed methods, we examined the use of a virtual cycling experience in a sample of 10 participants with cognitive impairment living in residential aged care facilities.

A thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews following the virtual cycling experience was also performed. No differences were observed between conditions for all outcomes except for environmental stimulation, where there was a lower response in the intervention than the control condition (p = 0.032). This was primarily driven by lower scores for the virtual cycling experience than control in physical accessibility (p = 0.012). Participants reported the virtual cycling experience to be immersive and challenging and reminisced about cycling earlier in life. The activity manager observed that the virtual cycling experience was an overall positive experience and emphasised benefits of safety screening and preparation prior to the activities.

            "abstract": "Aging leads to a complex pattern of structural and functional changes, gradually affecting sensorimotor, perceptual, and cognitive processes. These multiscale changes can hinder older adults' interaction with their environment, progressively reducing their autonomy in performing tasks relevant to everyday life. Autonomy loss can further be aggravated by the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., age-related macular degeneration at the sensory input level; and Alzheimer's disease at the cognitive level). In this context, spatial cognition offers a representative case of high-level brain function that involves multimodal sensory processing, postural control, locomotion, spatial orientation, and wayfinding capabilities. Hence, studying spatial behavior and its neural bases can help identify early markers of pathogenic age-related processes. Until now, the neural correlates of spatial cognition have mostly been studied in static conditions thereby disregarding perceptual (other than visual) and motor aspects of natural navigation. In this review, we first demonstrate how visuo-motor integration and the allocation of cognitive resources during locomotion lie at the heart of real-world spatial navigation. Second, we present how technological advances such as immersive virtual reality and mobile neuroimaging solutions can enable researchers to explore the interplay between perception and action. Finally, we argue that the future of brain aging research in spatial navigation demands a widespread shift toward the use of naturalistic, ecologically valid experimental paradigms to address the challenges of mobility and autonomy decline across the lifespan."

This study preliminarily investigated the mechanism of Atractylodes macrocephala(AM) against AD based on LKB1-AMPK-TFEB pathway. The effect of AM on memory ability of AD transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL2241 was detected, and then the APP plasmid was transiently transferred to mouse neuroblastoma(N2 a) cells in vitro. The mice were divided into the blank control group, APP group(model group), positive control group(100 μmol·L~(-1) rapamycin), and AM low-, medium-and high-dose groups(100, 200 and 300 μg·mL~(-1)). The content of Aβ_(1-42) in cell medium, the protein level of APP, the fluorescence intensity of APP, the transcriptional activity of transcription factor EB(TFEB), the activity of lysosomes in autophagy, and autophagy flux were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA), Western blot, fluorescence microscope, luciferase reporter gene assay, RLuc-LC3 wt/RLuc-LC3 G120 A, and mRFP-GFP-LC3, respectively. The protein expression of TFEB, LC3Ⅱ, LC3Ⅰ, LAMP2, Beclin1, LKB1, p-AMPK and p-ACC was detected by Western blot. Immunofluorescence and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) were used to detect the fluorescence intensity of TFEB and the mRNA expression of TFEB and downstream target genes, respectively. The results showed that AM reduced the chemotactic index of transgenic C. elegans CL2241, and decreased the content of Aβ in the supernatant of cell culture medium at different concentrations. In addition, AM lowered the protein level of APP and the fluorescence intensity of APP in a dose-dependent manner. Transcriptional activity of TFEB and fluorescence intensity of mRFP-GFP-LC3 plasmid were enhanced after AM treatment, and the value of RLuc-LC3 wt/RLuc-LC3 G120 A was reduced. AM promoted the protein levels of TFEB, LAMP2 and Beclin1 at different concentrations, and increased the protein expression ratio of LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ in a dose-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence results revealed that AM improved the fluorescence intensity and nuclear expression of TFEB, and RT-PCR results indicated that AM of various concentrations elevated the mRNA expression of TFEB in APP transfected N2 a cells and promoted the transcription level of LAMP2 in a dose-dependent manner, and high-concentration AM also increased the mRNA levels of LC3 and P62. The protein levels of LKB1, p-AMPK and p-ACC were elevated by AM of different concentrations. In summary, AM regulating lysophagy and degrading APP are related to the activation of LKB1-AMPK-TFEB pathway."

For this, we evaluated the efficacy of a 12-week computer-based memory-attention training program based on recognition in subjects with A-MCI and compared their performances with those of A-MCI controls trained in cognitively stimulating activities. The effect of training was assessed by comparing outcome measures in pre- and post-tests 15 days before and after training. To evaluate the duration of training benefits, a follow-up test session was performed 6 months after memory and attention training or cognitively stimulating activities. Outcome measures showed that the trained group, compared to control group, improved episodic recall and recognition. Six months after training, scores remained at the level of the post-test. Since the training program was exclusively based on recognition, our results showed a generalization from recognition to recall processes, which are memory components that represent part of the core cognitive impairments in individuals at risk of converting to AD. Thus, cognitive training based on recognition holds promise as a preventive therapeutic method and could be proposed as a non-pharmacological early-intervention strategy. Future investigations need to focus on methodological constraints and delineating possible neuroplastic mechanisms of action.\n"

            "abstract": "Lifestyle factors such as intellectual stimulation, cognitive and social engagement, nutrition, and various types of exercise appear to reduce the risk for common age-associated disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. In fact, many studies have suggested that promoting physical activity can have a protective effect against cognitive deterioration later in life. Slowing or a deterioration of walking speed is associated with a poor performance in tests assessing psychomotor speed and verbal fluency in elderly individuals. Fitness training influences a wide range of cognitive processes, and the largest positive impact observed is for executive (a.k.a. frontal lobe) functions. Studies show that exercise improves additional cognitive functions such as tasks mediated by the hippocampus, and result in major changes in plasticity in the hippocampus. Interestingly, this exercise-induced plasticity is also pronounced in APOE ε4 carriers who express a risk factor for late-onset AD that may modulate the effect of treatments. Based on AD staging by Braak and Braak (1991) and Braak et al. (1993) we propose that the effects of exercise occur in two temporo-spatial continua of events. The \"inward\" continuum from isocortex (neocortex) to entorhinal cortex/hippocampus for amyloidosis and a reciprocal \"outward\" continuum for neurofibrillary alterations. The exercise-induced hypertrophy of the hippocampus at the core of these continua is evaluated in terms of potential for prevention to stave off neuronal degeneration. Exercise-induced production of growth factors such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to enhance neurogenesis and to play a key role in positive cognitive effects. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) may mediate the exercise-induced response to exercise on BDNF, neurogenesis, and cognitive performance. It is also postulated to regulate brain amyloid β (Aβ) levels by increased clearance via the choroid plexus. Growth factors, specifically fibroblast growth factor and IGF-1 receptors and/or their downstream signaling pathways may interact with the Klotho gene which functions as an aging suppressor gene. Neurons may not be the only cells affected by exercise. Glia (astrocytes and microglia), neurovascular units and the Fourth Element may also be affected in a differential fashion by the AD process. Analyses of these factors, as suggested by the multi-dimensional matrix approach, are needed to improve our understanding of this complex multi-factorial process, which is increasingly relevant to conquering the escalating and intersecting world-wide epidemics of dementia, diabetes, and sarcopenia that threaten the global healthcare system. Physical activity and interventions aimed at enhancing and/or mimicking the effects of exercise are likely to play a significant role in mitigating these epidemics, together with the embryonic efforts to develop cognitive rehabilitation for neurodegenerative disorders."

Measures of combined sensory-motor-cognitive functioning may be early markers for identifying individuals who are at increased risk of developing dementia. Further, older adults experiencing subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may have elevated risk of dementia compared to those without SCD. Tasks involving complex, multisensory interactions reflective of everyday challenges may be particularly sensitive to subjectively perceived, pre-clinical declines. In the current study, older adults with and without SCD were asked to simultaneously perform a standing balance task and a listening task under increasingly challenging sensory/cognitive/motor conditions using a dual-task paradigm in a realistic, immersive virtual environment. It was hypothesized that, compared to older adults without SCD, those with SCD would exhibit greater decrements in postural control and listening response accuracy as sensory/motor/cognitive loads increased. However, counter to predictions, older adults with SCD demonstrated greater reductions in postural sway under more challenging dual-task conditions than those without SCD. Across both groups, poorer postural task performance was associated with poorer cognitive function and speech-in-noise thresholds measured with standard baseline tests. Poorer listening task performance was associated with poorer global cognitive function, poorer mobility, and poorer speech-in-noise detection. Overall, the results provide additional support for the growing evidence demonstrating associations between sensory, motor, and cognitive functioning and contribute to an evolving consideration of how best to categorize and characterize SCD in a way that guides strategies for screening, assessment, and intervention."

To better address this gap, we summarize the studies from the Healthy Action to Benefit Independence & Thinking (HABIT®) program, developed for persons with mild cognitive impairment (pwMCI) and their partners. HABIT® includes memory compensation training, computerized cognitive training (CCT), yoga, patient and partner support groups, and wellness education. Studies cited include (i) a survey of clinical program completers to establish outcome priorities; (ii) a five-arm, multi-site cluster randomized, comparative effectiveness trial; (iii) and a three-arm ancillary study. PwMCI quality of life (QoL) was considered a high-priority outcome. Across datasets, findings suggest that quality of life was most affected in groups where wellness education was included and CCT withheld. Wellness education also had greater impact on mood than CCT. Yoga had a greater impact on memory-dependent functional status than support groups. Yoga was associated with better functional status and improved caregiver burden relative to wellness education. CCT had the greatest impact on cognition compared to yoga. Taken together, comparisons of groups of program components suggest that knowledge-based interventions like wellness education benefit patient well-being (e.g., QoL and mood). Skill-based interventions like yoga and memory compensation training aid the maintenance of functional status. Notably, better adherence produced better outcomes. Future personalized intervention approaches for pwMCI may include different combinations of behavioral strategies selected to optimize outcomes prioritized by patient values and preferences."

People with mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP were assessed at the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center every 1-2 years, between March 23, 2003, and Aug 1, 2014. We measured global cerebral amyloid β (Aβ) load using (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound-B PET, posterior cortical metabolism with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, hippocampal volume (age and sex corrected) with T1-weighted MRI, verbal memory with the ten-item Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Word List Learning Delayed Recall Test, and general cognition with the Mini Mental State Examination. We estimated overall biomarker trajectories across estimated years from symptom onset using linear mixed models, and compared these estimates with cross-sectional data from cognitively normal control individuals (age 65-89 years) who were negative for amyloidosis, hypometabolism, and hippocampal atrophy. In the mutation carriers who had the longest follow-up, we examined the within-individual progression of amyloidosis, metabolism, hippocampal volume, and cognition to identify progressive within-individual changes (a significant change was defined as an increase or decrease of more than two Z scores standardised to controls).\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      16 people with mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP, aged 28-56 years, completed between two and eight assessments (a total of 83 assessments) over 2-11 years.

Among the seven participants with longest follow-up (seven or eight assessments spanning 6-11 years), three individuals had active amyloidosis without progressive neurodegeneration or cognitive decline, two amyloid-positive individuals showed progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline without further progressive amyloidosis, and two amyloid-positive individuals showed neither active amyloidosis nor progressive neurodegeneration or cognitive decline.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Our results support amyloidosis as the earliest component of the biomarker model in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.

Different forms of exercises, such as aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and coordination exercise, have different effects on the improvement of cognitive impairment. In recent years, exergames based on Non-Immersive Virtual Reality (NIVR-Exergames) have been widely used in entertainment and have gradually been applied to clinical rehabilitation. However, the mechanism of NIVR-Exergames on improving motor cognition has not been clarified. Therefore, the aim of this study is to find whether NIVR-Exergames result in a better neural response mechanism to improve the area of the cerebral cortex related to motor cognition under functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) dynamic monitoring in comparison with resistance exercise (resistance band stretching).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cross-over study design was adopted in this study, and 15 healthy young subjects (18-24 years old) were randomly divided into group A (n = 8) and group B (n = 7) according to a computerized digital table method. Task 1 was an NIVR-Exergame task, and Task 2 was resistance band stretching. Group A first performed Task 1, rested for 30 min (i.e., a washout period), and then performed Task 2. Group B had the reverse order. The fNIRS test was synchronized in real time during exercise tasks, and heart rate measurements, blood pressure measurements, and 2-back task synchronization fNIRS tests were performed at baseline, Post-task 1, and Post-task 2. The primary outcomes were beta values from the general linear model (GLM) in different regions of interest (ROIs), and the secondary outcomes were heart rate, blood pressure, reaction time of 2-back, and accuracy rate of 2-back.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The activation differences of Task 1 and Task 2 in the right premotor cortex (PMC) (P = 0.025) and the left PMC (P = 0.011) were statistically significant.

However, the neuropsychological profile of children with VL remains largely under-investigated in the scientific literature. Although previous research has shown that children with VL may experience some degree of delayed motor development, it is not yet clear if VL could also lead to specific delayed cognitive development. In this study, we will present the development and validation of a new tablet-based computerized test battery (VSAD) that evaluates visuospatial working memory, mental rotation, selective attention, and space orientation abilities. Thirteen children with VL and 54 average-age matched healthy children performed the VSAD and classical paper-and-pencil neuropsychological tasks twice within a 1-month interval. Our results demonstrated a good concurrent validity with strong correlations between the visuospatial working memory, mental rotation, and space orientation tests of the VSAD and classical tasks. Test-retest reliability was also supported through good intra-class coefficients. However, the test of selective attention showed no concurrent validity with the matched classical task. The discriminant validity of the VSAD was partially supported for visuospatial working memory and mental rotation performance accuracy. The VSAD shows good concurrent validity and reliability for measuring visuospatial working memory, mental rotation, and space orientation in children with VL. Future studies are needed to extend discriminant validity with other populations."

On the other hand, lack of growth hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone due to a recessive mutation in the Prop 1 gene (Prop1df) in Ames dwarf mice results in a phenotype characterized by potentiated antioxidant mechanisms, improved learning and memory, and significantly increased longevity in homozygous mice. Based on this, we hypothesized that a similar hormone deficiency might attenuate disease changes in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. To test this idea, APP/PS1 mice were crossed to the Ames dwarf mouse line. APP/PS1, wild-type, df/+, df/df, df/+/APP/PS1, and df/df/APP/PS1 mice were compared at 6 months of age through behavioral testing and assessing amyloid burden, reactive gliosis, and brain cytokine levels. df/df mice demonstrated lower brain growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 concentrations. This correlated with decreased astrogliosis and microgliosis in the df/df/APP/PS1 mice and, surprisingly, reduced Aβ plaque deposition and Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42 concentrations. The df/df/APP/PS1 mice also demonstrated significantly elevated brain levels of multiple cytokines in spite of the attenuated gliosis. These data indicate that the df/df/APP/PS1 line is a unique resource in which to study aging and resistance to disease and suggest that the affected pituitary hormones may have a role in regulating disease progression."

Organic chemistry lies at the heart of drug discovery and development. The current range of organic synthetic methodologies allows for the construction of unlimited libraries of small organic molecules for drug screening. In translational research projects, we have focused on the discovery of lead compounds for three major diseases: Alzheimer's disease (AD), breast cancer, and viral infections. In the AD project, we have taken a rational-design approach and synthesized a new class of tricyclic pyrone (TP) compounds that preserve memory and motor functions in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) mice. TPs could protect neuronal death through several possible mechanisms, including their ability to inhibit the formation of both intraneuronal and extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates, to increase cholesterol efflux, to restore axonal trafficking, and to enhance long-term potentiation (LTP) and restored LTP following treatment with Aβ oligomers. We have also synthesized a new class of gap-junction enhancers, based on substituted quinolines, that possess potent inhibitory activities against breast-cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Although various antiviral drugs are available, the emergence of viral resistance to existing antiviral drugs and various understudied viral infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, emphasizes the demand for the development of new antiviral agents against such infections and others. Our laboratories have undertaken these projects for the discovery of new antiviral inhibitors. The discussion of these aforementioned projects may shed light on the future development of drug candidates in the fields of AD, cancer, and viral infections."

Recently, particular miRs have demonstrated an involvement in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the specific role of miR-135b in AD has yet to be elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective role of miR-135b, in addition to its underlying mechanism. Herein, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was conducted to determine miR-135b expression levels in the peripheral blood samples of patients with AD and age-matched normal controls. The data of the present study revealed that the expression levels of miR-135b were significantly reduced in the peripheral blood of AD patients compared with normal controls (P<0.01). In vitro MTT analyses identified that the overexpression of miR-135b significantly enhanced the proliferation of hippocampal cells (P<0.01). Furthermore, in vivo analysis using a Y-maze test indicated that injection with miR-135b mimics into the third ventricle of anesthetized SAMP8 mice significantly enhanced their learning and memory capacities (P<0.01). Molecular mechanism investigations identified β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) as a direct target gene of miR-135b, and the latter was identified to negatively mediate the protein expression levels of BACE1 in hippocampal cells, in addition to hippocampal tissues, of SAMP8 mice. Based on the aforementioned findings, we propose that miR-135b has a neuroprotective role via direct targeting of BACE1 and, thus, may be used for the treatment of AD."

Most researchers believe that aggregation and accumulation of β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) in brain cells are the central pathological hallmark of this disease. Methods: Based on the amyloid hypothesis, a 10 amino acids β-sheet breaker peptide HPYD (His-Lys-Gln-Leu-Pro-Phe-Tyr-Glu-Glu-Asp) was designed according to the structure and sequence of the previous designed peptide H102. Accelerated stability test, thioflavine T (ThT) fluorescence spectral analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging were performed to detect the stability and inhibitory effects on the aggregation of Aβ1-42 by H102 and HPYD. FITC-labeled HPYD was first tested to determine whether it could be transferred along the olfactory pathway to the brain after nasal administration to mice. Subsequently, the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test for behavioral analysis was used to investigate the learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 transgenic mice by HPYD. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis was performed to determine the role of HPYD on Aβ and APP protein levels. In addition, microarray analysis was used to evaluate the effect of HPYD on gene expression in AD mouse models. Results: Our in vitro results demonstrated that HPYD had enhanced stability and inhibitory effects on Aβ1-42 aggregation compared to H102. HPYD could be delivered into the brain through nasal administration and improved the learning and memory ability in APP/PS1 transgenic mouse models by reducing Aβ and APP protein levels. In addition, microarray analyses suggested that several genes related to the inflammatory pathway, AD and gluco-lipid metabolism were dysregulated and could be restored to almost normal levels after HPYD administration to mice. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that HPYD could be a potential therapeutic drug candidate for the treatment of AD."

The pathogenesis of AD in traditional Chinese medicine is kidney deficiency and turbid phlegm. Based on this, GAPT (a mixture of herbal extracts) was made to invigorate kidney Yang and eliminate phlegm. Previous studies have shown that GAPT can improve and delay the memory decline, but the specific therapeutic target of AD in an early stage has not been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of GAPT on glucose metabolism in the early stage of AD. Eighty-eight 3-month-old male APP/PS1 transgenic mice were randomly divided into model group; donepezil group; and low, middle and high GAPT dosage groups. Twelve 3-month-old C57BL/6J mice were used as a control group. The Morris water maze test and the Step-Down Passive-Avoidance test were used to evaluate learning and memory ability. Cerebral extraction and the accumulation of glucose were scanned with a micro-positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging system. Immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect the expression of the PI3K/AKT-mTOR signalling pathway-related proteins and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice after 3 months of drug administration. GAPT can shorten the escape latency and error numbers compared to the model group. In micro-PET imaging analysis, GAPT can increase the glucose uptake average rate in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe and hippocampus. The immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis and PCR results indicated that GAPT can increase the expression of PI3K, AKT, GLUT1 and GLUT3 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. In summary, GAPT can improve brain glucose metabolism damage in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, mainly by increasing brain glucose uptake, increasing glucose transport and improving the insulin signalling pathway."

Raw training content is provided by our partner NeuroNation and delivered in several innovative ways. A baseline cognitive profile directs selection and sequencing of exercises within and between sessions and is updated during the 10-week 30-session module. Online trainers are available to provide supervision at different levels of engagement, including face-to-face share-screen coaching, a key implementation resource that is triaged by a \"red flag\" system for automatic tracking of user adherence and engagement, or through user-initiated help requests. Individualized and comparative feedback is provided to aid motivation and, for the first time, establish a social support network for the user based on their real-world circle of friends and family.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The MYB pilot was performed from November 2017 to March 2018. We are currently analyzing data from this pilot trial (n=100), which will make up a separate research paper. The main trial was launched in June 2018. Process and implementation data from the first training module (September to November 2018) are expected to be reported in 2019 and final trial outcomes are anticipated in 2022.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The BTS implemented in MYB is focused on maximizing adherence and engagement with CCT over the short and long term in the setting of a fully digital trial, which, if successful, could be delivered economically at scale.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12618000851268; https://www.anzctr.org.au /Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=370631&isReview=true."

Of note, 77 patients were enrolled in the study, 54 completed the cognitive training, and 48 completed all training and MRI sessions. We found significant improvement in performance across all trained tasks, but no additional gain of tDCS. fMRI-based brain activation showed high reliability, and higher cognitive performance was associated with increased tracking-related activation in the dorsal attention network and default mode network as well as anterior cingulate after compared to before the intervention. We found no significant associations between cognitive gain and brain activation measured before training or in the difference in activation after intervention.

            "title": "Why pleiotropic interventions are needed for Alzheimer's disease.",
            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves a complex pathological cascade thought to be initially triggered by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide aggregates or aberrant amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. Much is known of the factors initiating the disease process decades prior to the onset of cognitive deficits, but an unclear understanding of events immediately preceding and precipitating cognitive decline is a major factor limiting the rapid development of adequate prevention and treatment strategies. Multiple pathways are known to contribute to cognitive deficits by disruption of neuronal signal transduction pathways involved in memory. These pathways are altered by aberrant signaling, inflammation, oxidative damage, tau pathology, neuron loss, and synapse loss. We need to develop stage-specific interventions that not only block causal events in pathogenesis (aberrant tau phosphorylation, Abeta production and accumulation, and oxidative damage), but also address damage from these pathways that will not be reversed by targeting prodromal pathways. This approach would not only focus on blocking early events in pathogenesis, but also adequately correct for loss of synapses, substrates for neuroprotective pathways (e.g., docosahexaenoic acid), defects in energy metabolism, and adverse consequences of inappropriate compensatory responses (aberrant sprouting). Monotherapy targeting early single steps in this complicated cascade may explain disappointments in trials with agents inhibiting production, clearance, or aggregation of the initiating Abeta peptide or its aggregates. Both plaque and tangle pathogenesis have already reached AD levels in the more vulnerable brain regions during the \"prodromal\" period prior to conversion to \"mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\" Furthermore, many of the pathological events are no longer proceeding in series, but are going on in parallel. By the MCI stage, we stand a greater chance of success by considering pleiotropic drugs or cocktails that can independently limit the parallel steps of the AD cascade at all stages, but that do not completely inhibit the constitutive normal functions of these pathways. Based on this hypothesis, efforts in our laboratories have focused on the pleiotropic activities of omega-3 fatty acids and the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-amyloid activity of curcumin in multiple models that cover many steps of the AD pathogenic cascade (Cole and Frautschy, Alzheimers Dement 2:284-286, 2006)."

This study enrolled 40 older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), living in the community. The subjects were randomly assigned to a VRCMR group (n = 20) or a conventional cognitive rehabilitation (CCR) group (n = 20). The VRCMR group underwent VRCMR using MOTOcog, a computer recognition program, whereas the CCR group underwent conventional cognitive rehabilitation, which included puzzles, wood blocks, card play, stick construction activity, and maze activity. Both interventions were performed 30 min per day, 5 days/week, for 6 weeks. This study performed a cognitive assessment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale, Trail Making Test A and B (TMT-A/B), and Digit Span Test forward and backward (DST-forward/backward). In addition, a 0-to-10 numeric rating self-report scale was used to assess interest and motivation during the rehabilitation training.

Despite observed changes in expressional pattern of examined SOXB proteins, the proliferative capacity evaluated by the number of Ki-67 immunoreactive cells remained unaffected in transgenic mice of both genders. Based on our results, we suggest that SOXB proteins might be considered as new biomarkers for the detection of early impairments in adult neurogenesis in different animal models or/and new targets in human regenerative medicine."

            "abstract": "To understand normal function of memory studying models of pathological memory decline is essential. The most common form of dementia leading to memory decline is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in the affected brain regions. Altered production of amyloid beta (Abeta) through sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases seems to be a central event in the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. Thus, the study of the complex interplay of proteins that are involved in or modify Abeta production is very important to gain insight into the pathogenesis of AD. Here, we describe the use of Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), a Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method, to visualize protein-protein-interaction in intact cells, which has proven to be a valuable method in AD research."

            "abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms such as post-translational histone modifications are increasingly recognized for their contribution to gene activation and silencing in the brain. Histone acetylation in particular has been shown to be important both in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory formation in mice. The involvement of the epigenetic modulation of memory formation has also been proposed in neuropathological models, although up to now no clear-cut connection has been demonstrated between histone modifications and the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, we have undertaken preclinical studies in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD to determine whether there are differences in histone acetylation levels during associative memory formation. After fear conditioning training, levels of hippocampal acetylated histone 4 (H4) in APP/PS1 mice were about 50% lower than in wild-type littermates. Interestingly, acute treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA), prior to training rescued both acetylated H4 levels and contextual freezing performance to wild-type values. Moreover, TSA rescued CA3-CA1 LTP in slices from APP/PS1 mice. Based on this evidence, we propose the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the altered synaptic function and memory associated with AD. In this respect, histone deacetylase inhibitors represent a new therapeutic target to effectively counteract disease progression."

Because Alzheimer's disease impacts multiple cognitive domains, the current study employed an extensive behavioral battery and multimetric analysis therein to determine the impact of Abeta immunization given throughout most of adult life (from 2-16 1/2 months of age) to APP+PS1 transgenic mice. At both adult (4 1/2-6 month) and aged (15-16 1/2 month) test points, the same 6-week behavioral battery was administered. Results indicate that Abeta immunotherapy partially or completely protected APP+PS1 mice at both test points from otherwise impaired performance in a variety of tasks spanning multiple cognitive domains (reference learning/memory, working memory, search/recognition). At both adult and aged test points, the cognitive benefits of Abeta immunotherapy were evident even when behavioral measures were analyzed collectively (as \"overall\" performance) through discriminant function analysis. Since behavioral protection at the 15-16 1/2 month test point occurred without a decrease in (or correlation to) Abeta deposition, the mechanism of Abeta immunotherapy's action most likely involves neutralization/removal of small Abeta oligomers from the brain. However, in factor analysis performed at this aged test point, brain Abeta deposition measures loaded heavily with key cognitive measures. Collectively, our results suggest that the entire process of Abeta deposition deleteriously impacts cognitive performance and that Abeta-based preventative strategies can provide long-term cognitive benefits extending well into older age."

While there are many screening and diagnostic tools which attempt to measure spatial memory ability, they are often not representative of real-life situations and can therefore lack applicability. One potential solution to this problem involves the use of virtual reality (VR), which immerses individuals in a virtually-simulated environment, allowing for scenarios more representative of real-life without any of the associated risks. Here, we review the evidence surrounding the use of VR for the screening and diagnosis of spatial memory impairments, including potential limitations and how it compares to standard neuropsychological tests. We will also discuss the evidence regarding the potential use of VR in the rehabilitation of spatial memory deficits, which has not been well studied, but which could be game-changing if proven successful."

Results from the preliminary valuation using interview show positive feedback by the medical experts, since immersive VE allows the experience being in actual environment.

Neuropsychological studies have shown that AUD causes deficits in executive functions (EFs), a set of higher order cognitive skills that govern individual behavior in everyday situations. Many standardized neuropsychological tests are used to evaluate EF. These are reliable and valid but have limitations in predicting real-life performance. To address this, we present a preliminary study to test the virtual cooking task (VCT) as an alternative to standardized neuropsychological tests. The VCT includes four subtasks developed to assess attentional, planning, and cognitive shifting abilities; it was tested in an immersive three-dimensional environment. To evaluate the VCT performance and standardized neuropsychological tests, data were gathered from a sample of healthy subjects (control group [CG]; n = 23) and AUD patients (n = 18). The standardized neuropsychological measures used consisted of questionnaires (Attentional Control Scale, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, and Cognitive Flexibility Scale) and specific tests (Dot-probe task, Go/No-go test, Stroop test, the trail making test, and Tower of London test). The results showed significant higher correlations for AUD patients than for the CG for the VCT, questionnaires, and specific tests, mainly related to planning and cognitive shifting abilities. Furthermore, comparative analyses of the VCT performance showed that the AUD patients made more errors and had higher latency times than the CG.

The present study examined allocentric and egocentric spatial processing in relation to future dementia risk in a middle-aged cohort. The CAIDE Dementia Risk Score (DRS) was calculated for 188 persons aged 40 to 59, of whom 94 had a parent with dementia. Participants underwent the Four Mountains Test (4MT) of allocentric spatial processing, the Virtual Reality Supermarket Trolley Task (VRSTT) of egocentric spatial processing, and 3T MRI scans.

To overcome the poor druggability of BDNF, we have developed an agonistic antibody AS86 to mimic the function of BDNF, and evaluate its therapeutic potential for AD. Method: Biochemical, electrophysiological and behavioral techniques were used to investigate the effects of AS86 in vitro and in vivo. Results: AS86 specifically activated the BDNF receptor TrkB and its downstream signaling, without affecting its other receptor p75NTR. It promoted neurite outgrowth, enhanced spine growth and prevented Aβ-induced cell death in cultured neurons, and facilitated Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices. A single-dose tail-vein injection of AS86 activated TrkB signaling in the brain, with a half-life of 6 days in the blood and brain.

Taking these aspects into account, the impact of a novel virtual reality (VR)-based program combining aerobic exercise and cognitive training has been evaluated in the pilot study proposed here. Ten patients (aged 73.3 ± 5.7 years) with MCI (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE: 23.0 ± 3.4) were randomly assigned to either 6 weeks physical and cognitive training (EXP) or control (CTR) group. Evaluations of cognitive profile, by a neuropsychological tests battery, and OxS, by collection of blood and urine samples, were performed before and at the end of the experimental period. The assessment of the patients' opinions toward the intervention was investigated through questionnaires. EXP group showed a tendency towards improvements in the MMSE, in visual-constructive test and visuo-spatial tests of attention, while CTR worsened. EXP group showed a greater improvement than CTR in the executive test, memory functions and verbal fluency. No statistical significance was obtained when comparing within and between both the groups, probably due to small number of subjects examined, which amplifies the effect of the slight heterogeneity in scores recorded. Despite a greater worsening of Daily Living Activities tests, all participants reported a better performance in real life, thanks to the elicited self-perceived improvement. After training intervention OxS (i.e., reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative damage of lipids and DNA) decreased resulting in significantly (range p < 0.05-0.001) lower in EXP vs. CTR group. Although not conclusive, the recorded effects in the present study are promising and suggest that this proposal would be a useful tool in support of cognitive training reducing OxS too. However, further studies on larger scale samples of patients are needed."

            "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Aβ) oligomers are thought to be causative for the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Starting from the Aβ oligomer eliminating d-enantiomeric peptide D3, we developed and applied a two-step procedure based on peptide microarrays to identify D3 derivatives with increased binding affinity and specificity for monomeric Aβ(1-42) to further enhance the Aβ oligomer elimination efficacy. Out of more than 1000 D3 derivatives, we selected seven novel d-peptides, named ANK1 to ANK7, and characterized them in more detail in vitro. All ANK peptides bound to monomeric Aβ(1-42), eliminated Aβ(1-42) oligomers, inhibited Aβ(1-42) fibril formation, and reduced Aβ(1-42)-induced cytotoxicity more efficiently than D3. Additionally, ANK6 completely inhibited the prion-like propagation of preformed Aβ(1-42) seeds and showed a nonsignificant tendency for improving memory performance of tg-APPSwDI mice after i.p. application for 4 weeks. This supports the hypothesis that stabilization of Aβ monomers and thereby induced elimination of Aβ oligomers is a suitable therapeutic strategy."

            "abstract": "Coincident with the expanding population of aged people, the incidence of Alzheimer disease (AD) is rapidly increasing in most advanced countries. At present, no effective prophylactics are available. Among several pathological mechanisms proposed for AD, the \"amyloid hypothesis\" has been most widely accepted, in which accumulation or deposition of Aβ is considered to be the initial event. Thus, prevention of Aβ production would be an ideal strategy for the treatment or prevention of AD. Aβ is produced via the proteolytic cleavage of its precursor protein, APP (amyloid precursor protein), by two different enzymes, β and γ-secretases. Indeed, inhibitors against either or both enzymes have been developed and tested for clinical efficacy. Based on the \"amyloid hypothesis\", we developed a luciferase-based screening method to monitor γ-secretase activity, screened more than 1,600 plant extracts, most of which have long been used in Chinese medicine, and observed that Hop extracts significantly inhibit Aβ production in cultured cells. A major component of the inhibitory activity was purified, and its chemical identity was determined by NMR to be Garcinielliptone HC. In vivo, oral administration of Hop extracts to AD model mice decreased Aβ depositions in the cerebral cortex of the parietal lobe, hippocampus, and artery walls (amyloid angiopathy) in the brains. In a Morris water maze test, AD model mice that had daily consumed Hop extracts in their drinking water showed significant mitigation of memory impairment at ages of 9 and 12 months. Moreover, in the open field test oral administration of Hop extracts also prevented an emotional disturbance that appeared in the AD mice at 18 months. Despite lifelong consumption of Hop extracts, no deleterious side effects were observed at any age. These results support the \"amyloid hypothesis\", and indicate that Hop extract is a promising candidate for an effective prophylactic for AD."
