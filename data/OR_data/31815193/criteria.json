Interrater reliability is reported for the initial agreement on full text eligibility where values of kappa are rated as fair (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.4\u20130.59), good (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.6\u20130.74), or excellent (\u03ba\u2009>\u20090.75).47 Disagreement was resolved through discussion. If no consensus could be achieved, a third researcher was consulted (D.D.E.).",
