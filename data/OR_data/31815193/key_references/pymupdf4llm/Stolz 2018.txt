**_Objective: Internet-based cognitive–behavioral treatments (ICBT) have shown promise for various_**
mental disorders, including social anxiety disorder (SAD). Most of these treatments have been delivered
on desktop computers. However, the use of smartphones is becoming ubiquitous and could extend the
reach of ICBT into users’ everyday life. Only a few studies have empirically examined the efficacy of
ICBT delivered through a smartphone app and there is no published study on mobile app delivered ICBT
for SAD. This three-arm randomized-controlled trial (RCT) is the first to compare the efficacy of guided
ICBT for smartphones (app) and conventional computers (PC) with a wait list control group (WL).
**_Method: A total of 150 individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria for SAD were randomly assigned to_**
one of the three conditions. Primary endpoints were self-report measures and diagnostic status of SAD.
**_Results: After 12 weeks of treatment, both active conditions showed superior outcome on the composite_**
of all SAD measures (PC vs. WL: d � 0.74; App vs. WL: d � 0.89) and promising diagnostic response
rates (NNTPC � 3.33; NNTApp � 6.00) compared to the WL. No significant between-groups effects were
found between the two active conditions on the composite score (Cohen’s d � 0.07). Treatment gains
were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Program use was more evenly spread throughout the day in the
mobile condition, indicating an integration of the program into daily routines. Conclusions: ICBT can be
delivered effectively using smartphones.

**_What is the public health significance of this article?_**
This study demonstrates that internet-based cognitive–behavioral treatments can be implemented by
mobile devices, extending the reach into daily routines and fostering dissemination beyond the
prevalence of desktop computers, for example in developing countries.

Internet-based cognitive–behavioral treatments (ICBT) have
shown clinical efficacy and effectiveness for a variety of mental
disorders in a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs;
Andersson, Cuijpers, Carlbring, Riper, & Hedman, 2014; Hedman,
Ljótsson, & Lindefors, 2012). Most of the promising evidence
comes from studies evaluating guided ICBT, a treatment format in
which patients are supported by therapists or coaches while they

work their way through a structured self-help program (Andersson,
2016).
One of the most researched disorders in ICBT is social anxiety
disorder (SAD; Hedman, Botella, & Berger, 2016). A recent
review identified 21 studies investigating Internet-based treatments for SAD comprising a total of 1,801 individuals suffering
from SAD (Boettcher, Carlbring, Renneberg, & Berger, 2013).
Overall, the vast majority of the RCTs investigating ICBT for SAD
reported substantial reductions of social anxiety symptoms with
large within-group effect sizes (Cohen’s d � 0.80; Boettcher et al.,
2013). Trials directly comparing ICBT for SAD with face-to-face
therapy revealed that both conditions led to large and similar
clinical improvements (Andrews, Davies, & Titov, 2011; Botella
et al., 2010; Hedman, Andersson, et al., 2011). Furthermore,
treatment gains were stable for up to 5 years after treatment
termination and the available data also shows that ICBT can be a
cost-effective alternative to traditional CBT for SAD (Hedman,

Andersson, et al., 2011; Hedman, Furmark, et al., 2011). One study
also examined negative effects of ICBT for SAD (Boettcher,
Rozental, Andersson, & Carlbring, 2014). In this study, 14% of the
participants described unwanted negative events that they related
to the treatment. The emergence of new symptoms was the most
commonly experienced negative effect, followed by the aggravation of social anxiety symptoms and negative well-being.
SAD is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of negative
evaluation in social situations (American Psychiatric Association,
2013) and is one of the most common mental disorders with 12-month
prevalence estimates of 7–8% in large-scale community-based studies
(Kessler et al., 1994; Magee, Eaton, Wittchen, McGonagle, &
Kessler, 1996). ICBT may be especially suitable for this patient
group because the absence of face-to-face contact might reduce
fear and thereby improve learning of psychoeducational contents
of the treatment (Hedman et al., 2016). Furthermore, the majority
of individuals suffering from SAD do not seek treatment or if they
do, only after a long delay of up to several years (Wang et al.,
2005). Olfson et al. (2000) found that a considerable number of
individuals with SAD avoid seeking treatment because of their fear
of what others (including the therapist) might think of them. ICBT
may lower the threshold to seek help because socially anxious
individuals experience more control and less threat of negative
evaluation in online interactions (Lee & Stapinski, 2012).
So far, most evaluated Internet-based treatments have been
delivered via desktop computers. However, the increased usage of
smartphones presents promising opportunities to extend the reach
of ICBT into users’ everyday life, as these devices tend to be
always on and within an arm’s reach (Boschen & Casey, 2008; Ly
et al., 2015). Mobile treatments might also have further advantages
over more traditional ICBT because they allow users to perform
and record exercises in their natural environment (Bang et al.,
2007). Furthermore, the exercise instructions and supportive materials can be reviewed on demand in everyday situations (Watts et
al., 2013). Moreover, assessment can occur right before and after
critical events (Heron & Smyth, 2010) and thus may be less
biased by, for example, postevent processing (i.e., the tendency
for individuals with SAD to engage in a detailed review of
events following a social interaction). This might lead to more
valid diary entries and thereby to more specific feedback and a
more appropriate sense of increasing progress later on (Mellings & Alden, 2000). More generally, the use of ICBT on a
smartphone might lead to shorter but more frequent sessions
and therefore facilitate learning (Bjork, Dunlosky, & Kornell,
2013). Lastly, a smartphone can be used more privately than a
desktop computer that might be used by multiple people (Yuen,
Goetter, Herbert, & Forman, 2012).
On the other hand, mobile treatments may also have specific
drawbacks. For example, the small screen might cause problems
with longer texts and the lack of a keyboard might reduce comfort.
Consequently, contents might be skipped over and diary entries or
exercise records might be shorter than on a computer with larger
screens and keyboards, all lowering the depth of processing and
thereby probably lowering outcome.
Up to now, only few studies have evaluated smartphonedelivered treatments. In their systematic review, Donker et al.
(2013) could only identify a handful of smartphone applications
(apps) that have been empirically and systematically evaluated


(with a total N � 227). This low number is surprising given the
fact that about 18% of all 13,600 apps that had been published in
2013 targeted health behavior (Donker et al., 2013). To date, studies
on mobile interventions target various health-related areas, such as
depression (Burns et al., 2011; Ly et al., 2015; Ly, Trüschel, et al.,
2014; Watts et al., 2013), SAD (Dagöö et al., 2014), stress reduction
(Ly, Asplund, & Andersson, 2014), fitness (Fanning, Mullen, &
McAuley, 2012), weight loss (Carter, Burley, Nykjaer, & Cade,
2013), smoking cessation (Whittaker, McRobbie, Bullen, Rodgers, & Gu, 2016), and borderline personality disorder with
substance abuse (Rizvi, Dimeff, Skutch, Carroll, & Linehan,
2011). In an earlier study targeting SAD (Dagöö et al., 2014),
interventions could be accessed through smartphones, tablet
computers, and standard computers. Thus, and in contrast to the
current study, Dagöö et al. (2014) investigated an intervention
that was optimized for the use on various devices and did not
evaluate an app that only could be installed and used on
smartphones. In their rather small trial with a total of 52
participants, Dagöö et al. (2014) reported that participants used
the smartphone 42.8%, the computer 50.1%, and the tablet
computer 7.1% of the time. This study gave preliminary evidence that an intervention for SAD patients could be provided
via smartphones. However, this study compared Internet-based
cognitive behavior therapy with Internet-based interpersonal
psychotherapy and did not include a comparison of smartphone
versus computer-delivered treatment, therefore, more research
is needed regarding smartphone-delivered treatments for SAD.
Overall, results from the abovementioned studies indicate that
smartphone-delivered treatments might be feasible, acceptable,
efficacious, and suited for CBT-based treatments. However, the
available studies are rather small or uncontrolled, and larger controlled studies are needed. Moreover, some of the studies evaluated
blended treatments in which smartphone apps and face-to-face
therapies or regular ICBT delivered on desktop computers were
combined (Dagöö et al., 2014; Ly et al., 2015; Proudfoot et al.,
2013). Only two pilot studies compared mobile versus PC-based
treatment delivery (Carter et al., 2013; Watts et al., 2013) and
found no significant differences in efficacy. However, in these
cases, this could be explained by limitations of sample size and
power.

##### Objective and Study Aim


To evaluate whether a previously validated Internet-based selfhelp program for SAD remains efficacious when delivered via
smartphone app, we conducted a RCT in which we compared
guided ICBT disseminated by means of a personal computer (PC)
or an app with a wait list control group (WL). We hypothesized
that both active treatment conditions would be superior to the WL.
With regard to the active conditions, we did not have a clear
hypothesis. There is neither evidence nor theory that could give
conclusive hints to how assets and drawbacks of a mobile treatment might ultimately balance out. We also analyzed negative
effects, usage patterns and predictors of outcome in the two active
treatment conditions. To our knowledge, the new delivery option
has never been systematically compared to the already wellestablished PC-based distribution in a large RCT.

##### Method

 Recruitment and Participant Characteristics


Participants were recruited from the general population through
newspaper articles, mental health related magazines, online forums, and interviews on radio and TV. In addition, several participants found our recruitment page via different search engines or
links from other sites. The study website provided general information on SAD and its treatment, an outline of the study, a 24-hr
emergency phone number and a registration form. Further study
information and an informed consent form were provided via
e-mail after registration.
Criteria for inclusion were (a) a minimum age of 18 years, (b)
access to a computer and a smartphone both with Internet connection, (b) sufficient command of the German language, (c) exceeding the cut-off score on the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale
(SIAS) or Social Phobia Scale (SPS), and (d) a primary diagnosis
of SAD according to DSM–IV. Criteria for exclusion were (a) a
history of psychotic or bipolar disorders, (b) other ongoing psychological treatment, (c) prescribed medication for anxiety or
depression if the dosage had been changed during the last month
prior to participation, or (d) active suicidal plans. Candidates with
active suicidal plans were referred to a local psychiatrist or psychotherapist. Excluded persons were given access to the materials
outside of the study if they were in a stable condition and were
referred to other treatment options when needed.

##### Enrollment and Sampling Procedures


##### Study Design

This RCT compared two active groups with either mobile or
PC-based self-help to a WL. The WL received access to the mobile
version after the treatment groups had completed the program. In
the PC-based condition, access to the intervention was denied for
mobile devices; participants in the mobile condition could only use
the app on smartphones (iPhone or Android) to prevent shifts
between the active conditions. Both treatments were not publicly
available, as their use required participation in the study. All
participants were guided by individual coaches during their active
period. All groups were followed up until 3 months after treatment
completion, as depicted in the flowchart (see Figure 1).
[The trial was registered with controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN](http://controlled-trials.com)
10627379) and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Canton of Bern, Switzerland (13/05/2014, ref: 063/14).


After returning a signed copy of the informed consent form,
participants were asked to fill in the web-based baseline questionnaires, including SAD measures, questions concerning demographic variables, current medication, and prior or ongoing psychological treatment. When exceeding predefined cut-offs on one
of the two social anxiety measures (SPS � 22 or SIAS � 33;
Mattick & Clarke, 1998; German version: Stangier, Heidenreich,
Berardi, Golbs, & Hoyer, 1999), participants were interviewed by
phone using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM–IV—Axis
I disorders (SCID; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 2002;
German version by Wittchen, Zaudig, & Fydrich, 1997). The
interviews were conducted by the authors and 10 advanced master
students. All of them were previously trained in a workshop and
further educated and tested in personal trial interviews with detailed feedback. In addition, interviewers were supervised by Timo
Stolz and Thomas Berger. Interviewers could not be kept blind
regarding group assignment at postassessment because some participants disclosed aspects of the group assignment during the
interview.
A total of 853 individuals signed up on the study website. Two
hundred fifteen individuals signed the informed consent and completed the questionnaires. Out of those, 65 did not pass inclusion
and exclusion criteria, as depicted in Figure 1. The remaining 150
participants were then randomly assigned to one of the three
conditions: app, PC, or WL. The digital allocation tickets were
concealed from the investigators and were assigned using a computerized random number generator. After randomization, the participants received an e-mail regarding their allocation.


##### Clinical Intervention

Participants of both active groups received access to the same
self-help materials. The intervention is based on the cognitive
model of Clark and Wells (1995) and informed by the treatment
manual of Stangier, Heidenreich, and Peitz (2009). The same
materials have already been tested and proven efficacious in earlier
RCTs (Berger, Boettcher, & Caspar, 2014; Berger et al., 2011;
Berger, Hohl, & Caspar, 2009, 2010; Boettcher, Berger, & Renneberg, 2012; Schulz et al., 2016). The layout was adjusted for the
smaller screen sizes of smartphones. The treatment targets both
behavioral and cognitive maintaining factors, such as self-focused
attention, negative automatic thoughts, experiential avoidance,
processing of self as an object under social evaluation, ruminative
postevent processing of social situations, safety behaviors and
biased perception of somatic and cognitive anxiety symptoms.
**Contents.** The self-help program and smartphone app were
structured into eight modules:


1. Motivational enhancement: Participants are engaged in
thinking of reasons to initiate change; they define goals
and start to record difficult situations.

2. Psychoeducation: This module delivers information on
SAD with a focus on maintaining processes.

3. Cognitive restructuring: This module includes a thought
diary to track negative beliefs in daily routine, alongside
with exercises to formulate helpful thoughts.

4. Self-focused attention: Various exercises to intentionally
direct attention away from oneself.

5. Behavioral experiments: A training module for planning
and tracking in vivo exposures. This is further detailed in
the supplementary online materials, Supplemental Figure
S5 and S6.

6. Summary and repetition: The treatment’s key elements in
brief with an emphasis on the importance of repeated
practice.

7. Healthy lifestyle and problem solving: General information on health improving behaviors.

8. Relapse prevention: Strategies for maintaining the skills
learned and preparation for possible relapses.

The participants were advised to work through one module per
week and to start a new session after receiving a weekly feedback
on their written diary entries and recent progress. At the end of the
last module, participants were asked to repeat the exercises (e.g.,
exposure exercises) and to review the material as needed till
postassessment at the end of Week 12. Completing one module
unlocks the next, therefore, users are required to work through the
contents sequentially.
**Guidance.** Timo Stolz and 10 advanced master’s students in
clinical psychology provided guidance during treatment. All
coaches received a 1-day workshop in using the self-help program


and on how to write the weekly feedback, based on case material
from earlier trials. In addition, the coaches were continuously
supervised by Timo Stolz and Thomas Berger. Each coach cared
for seven to 20 participants, monitored their progress in the program, and contacted them via a secured text-based messaging
system once a week to provide feedback and encourage further
engagement. Besides, participants could send messages with specific questions and expect a response within three working days.
The coaches’ main role was to reinforce independent program use
and keep up the participants’ motivation. In case there was no
activity by a participant during the week, coaches offered their
help and assistance and asked if he or she was facing any problem
with the program or with the tasks.

##### Outcome Measures

Participants completed all self-report measures using web-based
versions at pretreatment, posttreatment (12 weeks) and follow-up
(3 months after post).
**Primary outcome measures.** Primary outcome measures assessed self-reported symptoms of SAD using German versions of
the SPS and SIAS and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale—Self
Report (LSAS-SR, Baker, Heinrichs, Kim, & Hofmann, 2002;
Stangier & Heidenreich, 2004). These measures are commonly
used in studies on SAD. The SPS and SIAS consist of each 20
items on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 4, resulting in a
total score between 0 and 80. The LSAS-SR has 24 items, each of
which is rated on a scale from 0 to 3. These three measures have
shown to be valid and reliable with very good internal consistencies (Cronbach’s alpha, SPS � .77–.94, SIAS � .84–.89, LSAS �
.95), good retest-reliability (rtt, SPS � .92, SIAS � .96, LSAS �
.83) in English (Mattick & Clarke, 1998) and German samples
(Stangier et al., 1999) and demonstrate similar properties when
administered online (Cronbach’s alpha, SPS � .89, SIAS � .86,
Hedman et al., 2010). In the current sample, Cronbach’s alpha for
the SPS was .86 at pretreatment and .91 at posttreatment, the SIAS
showed �s of .88 at pretreatment and .94 at posttreatment, and the
LSAS had �s of .92 at pretreatment and .95 at posttreatment.
Besides these self-report measures, a second diagnostic interview was conducted at posttreatment to assess the number of
participants no longer fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of SAD.
**Secondary outcome measures.** Secondary outcome measures
consisted of self-reported assessments of depressive symptoms,
interpersonal problems, quality of life, and overall psychiatric
symptoms using the German versions of the Beck Depression
Inventory-II (Hautzinger, Keller, & Kühner, 2006), the Inventory
of Interpersonal Problems (IIP, Horowitz, Strauß, & Kordy, 2000),
the psychological subscale of the Short Form-12 Health Survey
(SF-12, Gandek et al., 1998), and the Brief Symptom Inventory
(BSI, Derogatis, 1993; German version by Franke, 2000).
The Beck Depression Inventory-II is widely used to assess
depressive symptoms both in research and in clinical practice. It
consists of 21 items with Likert-ratings from 0 to 3 and robust
psychometric properties for SAD clients in online assessments
(Hedman et al., 2010). Cronbach’s alpha in the current sample was
.90 at pretreatment and .94 at posttreatment. The IIP was used to
assess interpersonal problems. It has shown adequate psychometric
properties (Horowitz, Rosenberg, Baer, Ureño, & Villaseñor,
1988) and consists of 64 items to be answered on a Likert scale
from 0 to 4. We report mean scores over all items as a measure of
interpersonal distress (McFarquhar, Luyten, & Fonagy, 2018;
Tracey, Rounds, & Gurtman, 1996). Cronbach’s alpha in the
current sample was .91 at pretreatment and .95 at posttreatment.
The SF-12 is a briefer variant of the Short Form Health Survey
(SF-36) and measures both physical and mental health. We only
report the mental health subscale because physical health is not
addressed by the treatment. Participants were asked to report the
presence and severity of mental problems over the course of the
last four weeks. The 12 items cover pain, psychological problems,
as well as impairments in everyday functioning. With its good
retest reliability and brevity, the SF-12 is widely used as an
estimate of the general quality of life (Gandek et al., 1998). The
BSI assesses psychological distress on nine dimensions such as


anxiety, insecurity in social situations, depressiveness and compulsivity. In the current sample, Cronbach’s alpha for the BSI was
.94 at pretreatment and .96 at posttreatment. The participants are
asked to rate the occurrence of symptoms within the last week on
a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4. In this study, we report the
Global Severity Index (GSI), which is the mean score over all
items. As an economic instrument with robust psychometric properties, the BSI is commonly administered to detect prepost changes
(Franke, 2000).

##### Power Calculation


The power analyses were conducted with G[�]Power 3 (Faul,
Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007). We aimed at detecting small
to medium effect sizes of f � 0.175 and larger with regard to
Time � Group interactions for the active conditions at an alpha
error level of .05. Smaller effect sizes were considered to be
irrelevant from a clinical point of view. A power analysis revealed
that 37 participants were needed per active treatment group to
show such an effect with a power (1 ��) of .80, assuming
correlations of r � .45 between pre- and postmeasures as previously found in similar trials on ICBT for SAD (Berger et al., 2011,
2009). Sample size was further estimated based on a drop-out rate
of 25%. Based on this assumption, we would have needed 47
participants in each treatment group. We finally decided to randomize 60 participants to each of the active conditions. A sensitivity power analysis revealed that given this sample size, a significance level of p � .05, and minimum power of .80, the test of
interaction effect was sufficiently sensitive to detect effect sizes of
_f �_ 0.130 which corresponds to a Cohen’s d of 0.26. Furthermore,
30 participants were estimated to be sufficient for the WL because
effect sizes between the WL and treatment groups were assumed to
be large based on the aforementioned earlier trials.

##### Statistical Analyses


All statistical analyses were performed with R (R Core Team,
2016) and the packages lme4 (Bates, Mächler, Bolker, & Walker,
2015) and mice (van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011).
Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and �[2] tests were used to detect
differences in demographic data, pretreatment measures, clinically
significant improvement, and diagnostic status at posttreatment.
Patterns of dropout were analyzed using a multivariate analysis of
variance (MANOVA) and Little’s (missing completely at random)
MCAR test (Little, 1988). For the primary analysis of our results,
we computed a composite score from the three social anxiety
measures (SIAS, SPS, LSAS) to avoid multiple testing and potential inflation of alpha-error. Z-scores were standardized based on
the pretreatment means and standard deviations. The composite
score and, as secondary analyses, all primary and secondary outcome measures were analyzed with mixed-effect models using
unstructured covariance matrices and restricted maximum likelihood estimation (Bates et al., 2015) with time-points nested within
subjects. This approach uses all available data of each subject
without substituting missing values and allows the inclusion of all
participants in the analyses, following the intention-to-treat principle. For robustness, these analyses were repeated using multiple
imputation and repeated-measures ANOVA with time (prepost) as
a within-group factor and treatment condition as a between-groups

factor. The models were further examined using contrast analyses.
Within- and between-groups effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were calculated based on estimated means and the pooled standard deviation
from the observed means. In addition, differences between the two
active conditions were analyzed using a JZS Bayes factor t test.
This test was computed using JASP (JASP Team, 2017) and
JASPs’ default priors together with a robustness analysis for
various prior widths. Within-group changes in outcome scores
from posttreatment to follow-up were analyzed for the active
conditions only, as the WL was assigned to treatment after 12
weeks. This was done with another mixed-effects model per outcome measure that involved all time points to retain as much
information as possible in case of missing values. Changes from
post to follow-up were then tested with Tukey’s honest significant
difference (HSD) post hoc tests. We also report the number of
participants who clinically significantly improved and who reliably deteriorated. Cases were counted as clinically significantly
improved if they changed reliably according to the reliable change
index (RCI; Jacobson, Follette, & Revenstorf, 1984) and belonged
to a functional population at posttreatment according to criterion
‘c’ of Jacobson et al. (1984), and under consideration of the
normative data provided by Stangier et al. (1999). As normative
data had been unavailable for the LSAS, cases were counted as
clinically significantly improved when the posttreatment score was
at least 2 standard deviations below the baseline assessment, which
is in accordance with criterion ‘a’ of Jacobson et al. (1984). The
following thresholds were computed for the primary outcome
measures: for the SPS, 15.34, RCI � 7.39; for the SIAS, 24.05,
RCI � 10.33; and for the LSAS, 42.24, RCI � 23.89. Reliable
deterioration was defined as a prepost increase on the SPS, the


SIAS or the LSAS of at least the RCI defined above. With regard
to clinically significant improvement we also report numbers needed
to treat (NNT). NNT is the number of patients who need to be treated
to achieve one additional positive outcome—in comparison to another
treatment or a placebo. When pWL is the probability of remissions in
the WL, and pApp is the probability of being cured by the app
treatment, the NNT equals to 1/(pApp � _pWL)._

##### Results


##### Dropout Analysis

In total, 39 participants (26%) did not complete the posttreatment assessment, although they had been invited three times in
weekly intervals via e-mail (PC, n � 14; app, n � 18; and WL,
_n �_ 7). Noncompletion rates did not differ with respect to experimental group, �[2](2, N � 150) � 0.83, p � .66, V � 0.07, nor
demographic data, �[2](1–16, N � 150) � 0.07–19.22, ps � .12–
.79, V � 0.02–0.26, except for education: A Mann–Whitney test
indicated that completers were significantly more educated than
noncompleters, W � 2654, Z � 2.24, p � .02, r � .18.


##### Pretreatment Evaluation

The conditions did not differ in symptom severity or demographic variables with two exceptions: Participants in the mobile
condition were less educated, �[2](6, N � 150) � 14.29, p � .03,
_V �_ 0.22, and had a higher GSI prescore, t(117.85) ��2.46, p �
.02, d � 0.45, than participants in the PC-based condition. Table
1 provides further details.

Furthermore, dropout was unrelated to symptom severity at
baseline according to Little’s MCAR test, �[2](6) � 9.34, p � .16,
and confirmed with a MANOVA across all primary and secondary
measures with missingness as grouping factor, F(6, 143) � 1.58,

##### Treatment Outcomes


Observed and estimated means for all self-report measures are
presented in Table 2.
**Composite score.** A linear mixed model for composite symptoms showed a significant Time � Group interaction, F(2,
120.09) � 14.18, p � .01. A consecutive contrast analysis showed
that both active treatments outperformed the WL at post,
_t(119.46) �_ 5.08, p � .01, d � 1.07, with no significant difference
between the active conditions but a trend in favor of the app
condition, t(120.75) � 1.71, p � .09, d � 0.30.
**Separate measures.** Further linear mixed models with group
as a fixed factor and time as a repeated factor (pre—post) were
fitted separately for each of the dependent measures. Significant


Time � Group interaction effects have been found for all primary
and secondary outcomes, F(2, 117.46–121.83) � 4.08–11.71,
_ps �_ .01–.02. Consecutive contrast analyses showed that both
active treatments were significantly superior to the WL on all
involved measures, t(113.84–121.67) ��2.78– 4.60, ps � .01,
_ds �_ 0.53–1.01. However, there was no significant difference
among the active conditions—neither on primary outcomes,
_t(117.90–121.49) �_ 1.28–1.61, ps � .11–.20, ds � 0.20–0.30,
nor on secondary outcomes, t(114.85–123.14) ��0.71– 1.06,
_ps �_ .29–.71, ds ��0.11–0.20, except for the GSI in which the
mobile group fared significantly better, t(120.16) � 2.06, p � .04,
_d �_ 0.38. When adjusting the p values for multiple testing, both
active treatments still significantly outperformed the WL on all
involved measures, all adjusted ps � .01.
Because neither of the active treatments was found to be superior over the other, neither on the primary outcomes nor on the
secondary measures, standardized differences of estimated pre-topost changes are reported together with their confidence intervals
in the supplementary online materials. On the SPS, the SIAS, and

the LSAS, the 95% confidence intervals of these differences are
bounded to be lower than 0.12 SDs in favor of the PC-based
version. Therefore, even in the strongest case there would only be
a small effect in favor of the PC-based delivery option. Furthermore, a JZS Bayes factor t test suggested that the data was 9.89
times more likely to be observed when the mobile treatment was as
efficacious as the PC-based version. This gives moderate evidence
that the mobile treatment is at least not less efficacious than the
PC-based version. Further details of the test are reported in the
supplementary online materials, including a robustness analysis for
a broad range of priors, Supplemental Figure S7.

##### Sensitivity Analysis


Regarding the composite score and single primary outcomes, the
same pattern of results was found (a) on completers’ data, (b) using
multiple imputation, and (c) when controlling for education, current medication or prior psychotherapy. The same pattern was also
found for secondary outcomes, except for the GSI: The difference
between both active groups was found to be significant with
procedure (c) but not with procedures (a) or (b). Overall, the
analyses of primary and secondary outcomes were robust. Nevertheless, results regarding the GSI have to be interpreted with
caution. The significant results found in the corresponding linear
mixed effects model could have been biased by dropout of more
severely affected participants.

##### Effect Sizes


##### Diagnostic Status at Post-Treatment

In total, 92 participants could be reached for a second clinical
interview after the treatment (app, n � 34 [57%]; PC, n � 37

[62%]; and WL, n � 21 [70%]; with �[2](2) � 1.50, p � .47, for
differences in response rate). To deal with a total of 39% of
missing interviews, we administered several procedures to examine the fraction of cured participants. First, we analyzed completers only (PC: 14/37 [37.8%], app: 9/34 [26.5%]). Second, we
considered all missings as still suffering from SAD (PC: 14/60

[23.3%], app: 9/60 [15.0%]). Third, we considered all missings as
still suffering from SAD unless they showed a clinically significant improvement on the self-reported primary outcomes (PC:
18/60 [30.0%], app: 10/60 [16.7%]).
Regardless of the procedure, all participants in the WL were still
diagnosed with SAD. The PC-based group fared significantly
better than the WL, regardless of the adopted procedure, �[2](1, N �
58–90) � 6.61–9.45, ps � .01, V � 0.27–0.38. The mobile group
showed significant differences for the first and the third procedure,
�[2](1, N � 55–90) � 4.06–4.85, ps � .03–.04, V � 0.21–0.30, but
not for the second procedure, �[2](1, N � 90) � 3.47, p � .06, V �
0.20. Differences between the active groups were not significant
regardless of the approach.


Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) are presented in Table 2. The betweengroups effect sizes at posttreatment on the composed social anxiety
measures were d � 0.07 for app versus PC (in favor of the app),
_d �_ 0.89 for app vs. WL, and d � 0.74 for PC v. WL. Mean
between-groups effect sizes on secondary outcome measures were
_d �_ 0.10 for PC versus app (in favor of the PC-based version), d �
0.39 for app vs. WL, and d � 0.52 for PC v. WL. Within-group
comparisons on the composite outcome and based on estimated
means revealed large effect sizes in the PC-based group (d � 1.25)
as well as in the mobile group (d � 1.84; see Table 2 for detailed
information).

##### Clinically Significant Improvement


##### Treatment Effects at Three-Month Follow-Up

All analyses in this section only include the two active conditions, as the WL had already received access to the mobile version
of the treatment. Mixed-models analyses including pre, post, and
follow-up scores showed significant time effects for all scales, F(2,
166.86–176.07) � 31.99–150.09, ps � .01. Contrast analyses
indicate that follow-up scores improved from baseline, t(170.41–
180.46) ��14.96– 8.07, ps � .01, ds � 0.75–1.52, and post hoc
tests using Tukey’s HSD indicate stability from posttreatment to
follow-up, as no significant changes were detected, ps � .05–.98.
All Time � Group interactions were nonsignificant, F(2, 166.86–
176.07) � 0.23–2.04, ps � .13–.79, thus through all time points,
neither of the delivery options were significantly superior.


##### Reliable Deterioration

Two participants (1.3%) achieved reliable deterioration on the
SPS (app, n � 1, WL, n � 1) and one participant (0.7%) deteriorated reliably in the PC-based group on the SIAS.


The WL had no cases of clinically significant improvement
(CSI) on the SPS and the SIAS, but two such cases (6.7%) on the
LSAS. In contrast, the PC-based condition achieved higher
amounts of such cases on the SPS (n � 16 [26.67%], NNT �
3.75, ��[2](1, N � 90) � 7.99, p � .01, V � 0.30), the SIAS (n �
12 [20.00%], NNT � 5.00, �[2](1, N � 90) � 5.30, p � .02, V �
0.24), and the LSAS (n � 13 [21.67%], NNT � 6.67, �[2](1, N �
90) � 2.25, p � .13, ns, V � 0.16). The same applies to the mobile
condition, again on the SPS (n � 12 [20.00%], NNT � 5.00, �[2](1,
_N �_ 90) � 5.30, p � .02, V � 0.24), the SIAS (n � 10 [16.67%],
NNT � 6.00, �[2](1, N � 90) � 4.06, p � .04, V � 0.21), and the
LSAS (n � 12 [20.00%], NNT � 7.50, �[2](1, N � 90) � 1.79, p �
.18, ns, V � 0.14). No significant differences were found between
the two active conditions.


##### Program Usage

Details on program usage are provided as supplementary online
material. In summary, the mobile treatment was used less extensively in terms of (a) the number of performed exercises, (b)
recorded diary entries, (c) number and length of messages written
by patients, (d) single actions like clicks or taps, (e) time spent
using the program, and (f) completed modules. In addition, residualized posttreatment outcome was predicted by active program
usage. However, significant correlations were found in the mobile
condition only. The most influential predictor was the number of
tracked exposure exercises (�� .47, p � .01). For these correlative analyses, residual gain scores of the composite outcome and
computed Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were used.

MOBILE APP FOR SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER 501


Single actions like clicks or taps were distributed differently
over the course of the day in the two conditions (Figure 3 and 4).
In the mobile condition, the usage was spread more evenly across
the day, whereas members of the PC-based condition performed a
higher fraction of their work during the night (see Figure 3). A
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test suggested nonequal distributions, D �
0.14, p � .01. Furthermore, there was a significant Hour X Group
interaction for the count of actions, F(23, 1553.87) � 1.93, p �
.01, indicating a different usage pattern over time in the two
conditions. Finally, usage decreased significantly after postassessment, however, without significant differences among the active
conditions.

##### Discussion


This RCT compares the efficacy of a mobile and a PC-based
SAD treatment program to a WL. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first large RCT comparing mobile and PC-based dissemination of the same guided self-help treatment. In addition, it is
the largest trial using smartphones to target a specific disorder. We
found two prior pilot studies that have been either rather small
(Watts et al., 2013; NPC-vs.-App � 35) or were not targeting a
specific psychological disorder (weight loss; Carter et al., 2013;
_NPC-vs.-App �_ 85). In the present study, both treatment formats
were effective in reducing symptoms of SAD and increasing
psychological well-being after 12 weeks of treatment. The withingroup effect sizes of d � 1.84 (mobile) and d � 1.25 (PC) are in
line with recent meta-analyses on ICBT for SAD (Andrews, Cuijpers, Craske, McEvoy, & Titov, 2010; Spek et al., 2007) and
earlier trials using the same materials (Berger et al., 2009, 2010,
2011; Boettcher et al., 2012; Schulz et al., 2016). Of all treated
participants, 28.3% achieved clinically significant improvement on
at least one of the primary outcome scales (mobile: 23.3%, PC:
33.3%), compared to none in the WL. Furthermore, 19.2% of the
participants did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria of SAD at posttreatment when missings were regarded as failures to provide
conservative estimates (mobile: 15.0%, PC: 23.3%) compared to
none in the WL. Improvements were maintained six months after
randomization. Given that 62.0% of participants had been treated
with psychotherapy in the past and that participants showed high
comorbidity rates, these results can be interpreted as encouraging.
The effect sizes between the active treatment groups and the WL
were at d � 0.89 (mobile) and d � 0.74 (PC) for the composite
social anxiety score. These between-groups effect sizes can be
compared with the effects on traditional therapist-delivered CBT
reported in a meta-analysis by Acarturk, Cuijpers, van Straten, and
de Graaf (2009), in which a subgroup analysis of 35 studies with
wait list comparisons revealed a mean effect size of d � 0.86 on
social anxiety measures for therapist-delivered CBT, cognitive
therapy, social skills training, relaxation, and/or exposure. However, the between-groups effect sizes in the current study are
slightly below the effect sizes reported in a more recent metaanalysis which found standardized mean differences of Hedges’
_g �_ 1.19 for individual CBT versus wait lists (Mayo-Wilson et al.,
2014). Also, the percentage of participants who clinically significantly improved was below the range of that reported in studies on
evidence-based face-to-face CBT, though comparisons are difficult because definitions of clinically significant improvement vary
across studies. For instance, a trial on face-to-face CBT based on


the same approach as our study (Clark & Wells, 1995) reported
high clinically significant improvement rates of 74% on the SPS
and of 63% on the SIAS for individual CBT (Stangier, Heidenreich, Peitz, Lauterbach, & Clark, 2003). However, the mean
scores of the two studies at posttreatment are quite similar (e.g.,
SPS posttreatment Stangier et al.: 21.5 vs. SPS posttreatment
present study: 22.0). Thus, the low CSI rates in the current study
may be partly due to a conservative estimate. Another reason for
the low CSI rates is that the present sample was highly impaired.
Pretreatment scores on social anxiety measures in the current study
were about half a standard deviation higher than pretreatment
scores reported in studies on face-to-face CBT (e.g., Stangier,
Heidenreich, Peitz, et al., 2003). The high scores at pretreatment
could have reduced the chance of falling below the cut-off. Furthermore, the high pretreatment scores also indicate that our sample may be representative for a severely impaired population of
SAD patients that typically seek information about the disorder on
the Internet (Erwin, Turk, Heimberg, Fresco, & Hantula, 2004).
Regarding the comparison between the two active conditions,
neither of the two treatment formats was significantly superior to
the other, except for the GSI in which the mobile group showed
greater improvements. However, the difference in gains is small
and might in part be explained by regression toward the mean, as
the mobile group had a significantly higher GSI prescore. With
regard to the primary self-report measures, the mobile treatment
can be considered as efficacious as the PC-based version, although
the mobile version was less extensively used in terms of (a)
performed exercises, (b) recorded diary entries, (c) number and
length of written messages, (d) single actions like clicks or taps, (e)
time spent using the program, and (f) completed modules. Taken
together, the mobile delivery might require a smaller dose to
achieve the same effect. This might be due to different mechanisms of change, which are indicated by the differing correlations
of usage and outcome and, even more, by the different usage
patterns during the course of a typical day. However, only little is
known about the association of adherence, usage patterns, and
outcome in Internet-based treatments (Donkin et al., 2011). Thus,
further research should address differences in mechanisms of
change for mobile and PC-based delivery. It could be assumed that
exposure exercises have a stronger impact on outcome when they
are prepared on a mobile device and then conducted spontaneously, whenever the opportunity arises. It might be of further
advantage that the exercise can then be immediately recorded. This
immediacy prevents postevent processing from diminishing the
sense of progress. However, and importantly, according to the
current findings an evidence-based treatment can be presented
both on mobile devices and on the PC without altering the efficacy.

##### Limitations


Several limitations of this study need to be considered. First,
participants had to work either with a PC or with a smartphone and
could therefore not be blinded to treatment allocation. The same is
true for their guiding coaches and the diagnostic interviewers, as
most of the participants unwittingly revealed their mode of treatment within the messages and/or during the interview and no
measures were taken to prevent participants from breaking the
blind. In addition, the interrater reliability of SAD diagnoses was
not formally established. Second, the findings provide evidence for

this particular treatment and cannot be easily generalized to other
programs or disorders. However, similar results were found in
small pilot studies on depression (Watts et al., 2013) and weight
loss (Carter et al., 2013), which also compared mobile and PCbased treatments, and one trial with a mobile treatment for SAD is
announced (Miloff, Marklund, & Carlbring, 2015). Nevertheless,
findings from this trial should be replicated in other disorders.
Third, the limited power of this study did not allow us to detect
small effects between the two active groups at posttreatment. At
the level of an individual treatment, such small effects might be
less important than other therapy-related factors, but from a public
health perspective, small effects with large populations can have
great societal impact. Therefore, our findings should be replicated
in larger samples and in an unguided format, because unguided
treatments would be especially suitable for public health interventions. To deal with power limitations in this trial, interaction
effects were analyzed using contrast analyses to provide a more
sensitive estimation of differences in efficacy between the active
conditions. Contrast analyses have more power as opposed to
comparisons at one point in time, as they can account for repeated
measures and thus are able to assign variance within the subjects.
Furthermore, a JZS Bayes factor t test was added to assess the
likelihood of similar effects for both active conditions. This test
suggested that the data was 9.89 times more likely to be observed
when the mobile treatment was at least as efficacious as the
PC-based version, instead of the PC-based version being truly
superior. Fifth, this study tested a self-selected sample with individuals who expressed their interest in an Internet-based delivery.
In addition, treatment expectancy was not assessed. Therefore, we
could not establish whether the results might depend on particularly motivated patients. However, other studies indicate that
Internet-based interventions work just as well in routine practice as
in research (e.g., Andersson & Hedman, 2013).

##### Conclusion


Despite these limitations, the present study extends the existing
knowledge on ICBT by systematically testing a novel delivery
option. Besides easier integration in daily life and routine, mobile
CBT could have promise for low and middle-income countries due
to a large unmet need for mental health services (Saraceno et al.,
2007), in which the coverage of smartphones with an Internet
subscription is much higher than those of online desktop computers might ever be (Aranda-Jan, Mohutsiwa-Dibe, & Loukanova,
2014).
In conclusion, this study provides evidence that SAD can be
effectively treated with mobile self-help applications, with treatment gains being maintained 6 months after randomization.
