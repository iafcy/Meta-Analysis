Cognitive models of insomnia propose that attentional vigilance for threat during the pre-sleep period may play a causal role
in insomnia by elevating physiological and psychological arousal
to produce a state that is incompatible with the initiation of sleep
[1] . Consistent with such theoretical accounts, studies have confirmed that insomnia is associated with patterns of biased attention
favouring sleep-related threatening information [2] .
Converging research has shown that attentional bias assessment methodologies, such as the attentional probe task, can be
converted to attentional bias modification (ABM) tasks. Using
such tasks it has been shown that modification of biased attention
for threat can achieve therapeutic benefits in conditions where this
bias is implicated, including anxiety and mood disorders [3] . Of
specific relevance to the current research is the observation that a
single session of computer-based ABM can have immediate effects
on anxiety and stress reactivity [3] . Therefore, we sought to assess
whether targeted delivery of an ABM task during the pre-sleep period could reduce symptoms of insomnia and the cognitive symptoms of pre-sleep arousal.
Invitations were extended to individuals from the University of
Western Australia School of Psychology participant pool who had
identified worry-related insomnia as a problem (n = 236, n = 41
accepted). Inclusion criteria (met by n = 36) were access to an
iPhone, high levels of insomnia symptoms on the Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index (score ≥ 5 [4] ), completing at least 4 of 5 ABM/control sessions during the study, and consistent accuracy on the attentional probe task (>70%). Participants were randomly allocated
to the ABM (n = 18; 12 female) or control condition (n = 18; 15
female).
The study spanned 8 days (7 nights). The first 2 days served as
a baseline period in which participants completed self-report measures and wore the sleep monitor, but did not complete the ABM
or control task. These initial baseline days were followed by 5 con

secutive ‘task completion days’ in which the participants completed, immediately prior to bed, an ABM task (ABM condition) or a
non-training control task (control condition) on their smartphone. Both tasks employed 48 word pairs comprising sleep-related threat words paired with non-threat words. The task format was
similar to standard ABM tasks used in prior studies [3], with task
parameters adapted for use on an iPhone. On each trial an initial
fixation cross was followed by two vertically aligned words, one
threatening sleep-related word and one neutral word. After 500 ms
the word pair was replaced by a probe appearing in the location of
one of the words. The participants discriminated probe identity
(horizontally or vertically aligned dots) by tapping the corresponding horizontal or vertical arrow icon at the bottom of the iPhone
screen. In the ABM condition, probes always appeared opposite
the threat word to encourage attentional avoidance of sleep-related threat. In the control condition and on assessment trials, probes
replaced the threat and neutral words with equal frequency, so as
not to encourage any pattern of selective attention. On task completion days 1–5, the participants completed 384 trials prior to
sleep each night (approx. 15 min). Of these, 288 were ABM/control
trials, and 96 were assessment trials randomly dispersed within the
latter half of the ABM/control trials. An index of attentional bias
to threat was computed across assessment trials in a manner consistent with past studies [3] . Further details of task parameters,
stimulus creation, experimental methodology and additional discussion of findings are available in supplementary online material via the following link: http://www.psychology.uwa.edu.au/research/care/research/ClarkePPS).
On the first day of the study, the participants completed the
trait version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [5], the Penn
State Worry Questionnaire [6] and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index [4], while baseline attentional bias was assessed with 96 trials
of the attentional probe assessment task. On all days, the participants completed the cognitive subscale of the Pre-Sleep Arousal
Scale [7] prior to sleep (following probe task completion on task
completion days). Additionally, we assessed the time taken to fall
asleep (sleep onset latency) and the frequency of waking both objectively, with a wireless electrophysiological monitor [8] and subjectively via a sleep diary [9] . The latter also provided ratings of
overall sleep quality (from 1 = very bad to 5 = very good). Finally,
changes in insomnia-related anxiety between days 1 and 8 were
assessed using the Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire (APSQ [10] ).
Participants in the ABM and control groups did not differ significantly in gender (p > 0.10), age or any baseline measures, with
the exception of sleep quality ( table 1 ). All daily measures were
subjected to an ABM condition (ABM/control) by probe task day
(1–5) mixed model ANOVA. Results revealed main effects of the
ABM condition showing that, compared to those in the control

condition, subjects in the ABM condition reported significantly
lower pre-sleep arousal (on the cognitive subscale of the Pre-Sleep
Arousal Scale) and better overall sleep quality (a reversal of the
baseline difference). Additionally, electrophysiological monitor
measures showed that those in the ABM condition fell asleep faster and woke less often during the night compared to controls. No
other significant main effects or interactions were observed (all
F < 1.7, all p > 0.15; see table 1 for means and between-group differences).
Changes in sleep-related anxiety (APSQ) were assessed via a
condition (ABM/control) by assessment time (pre-/post-assessment) mixed model ANOVA, which showed a significant interaction effect, F(1, 34) = 5.44, p = 0.03, η [2] = 0.16. This interaction was
carried by a significant decrease in APSQ scores from pre-assessment (mean = 61.61, SD = 18.00) to post-assessment time points
(mean = 40.72, SD = 13.38) in the ABM group, t = 3.86, p < 0.01,
d = 1.32, that did not approach significance for the pre-assessment
(mean = 61.50, SD = 17.88) to the post- assessment time (mean =
56.17, SD = 14.34) in the control group, t = 1.36, p = 0.19, d = 0.33.
In summary, as compared to the control condition, participants
who completed ABM training reported less pre-sleep arousal, fell
asleep faster, woke less often during the night, reported a better
overall sleep quality and showed significant reductions in sleeprelated anxiety from before to after the 5-day programme.


Although these effects are entirely consistent with the positive
effects of ABM on relevant sleep measures, we did not also observe
any significant change in attentional bias. While this may represent
a genuine absence of bias change, the consistency of effects across
separate sleep measures suggests that ABM was having the intended effect. It is possible therefore that iPhone-based assessment coupled with the relatively small sample size may not have been sufficient to detect bias changes. Indeed, a post hoc power analysis
suggests that in order to detect a medium-sized between-group
effect in attentional bias it would be necessary to recruit a sample
with more than 50 participants.
Overall, these results suggest that attentional bias modification
targeting vigilance for sleep-related threat during the pre-sleep period has the capacity to reduce cognitive arousal and improve insomnia symptoms, providing a crucial step towards establishing a
novel intervention for insomnia. Given the small sample size, replication with a larger sample will be crucial before it is possible to
draw firm conclusions about potential benefits of ABM for insomnia. Nevertheless the results provide encouragement that targeted
ABM could be used not only as a potential treatment for insomnia,
but also with other conditions that implicate attentional bias (and
consequent anxious arousal), as being acutely problematic at specific points in time. These findings therefore not only highlight a
novel target for ABM in insomnia, but also a novel method of ABM
by targeting acute rather than enduring change in attentional bias.
