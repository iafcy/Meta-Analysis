**_Objective: Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) are a major public health problem that_**
traditional interventions have been unable to address on a large scale. The goal of this series of studies
was to take initial steps toward developing an effective SITB treatment that can be easily delivered on
a very large scale. Method: We created a brief (1–2 min), game-like app called Therapeutic Evaluative
Conditioning (TEC), designed to increase aversion to SITBs and decrease aversion to the self. In 3
separate studies, we recruited participants with recent and severe histories of SITBs from web forums
focused on self-injury and psychopathology (Ns � 114, 131, and 163) and randomly assigned them to
receive access to the mobile treatment TEC app or a control app for 1 month. We tested the effect of TEC
on the frequency of self-cutting, nonsuicidal self-injury more generally, suicide ideation, suicide plans,
and suicidal behaviors. Results: Analyses showed that, compared with the control app, TEC produced
moderate reductions for all SITBs except suicide ideation. Across studies, the largest and most consistent
reductions were for self-cutting episodes (32%–40%), suicide plans (21%–59%), and suicidal behaviors
(33%–77%). Two of the 3 studies showed that TEC impacted its intended treatment targets and that
greater change in these targets was associated with greater SITB reductions. TEC effects were not
maintained at the 1-month posttreatment follow-up. Conclusions: Future versions of brief, mobile
interventions like that tested here may have the potential to reduce SITBs and related behaviors on a large
scale.


**_What is the public health significance of this article?_**
Across 3 studies, we found that a brief mobile app generated moderate reductions in nonsuicidal and
suicidal self-injury. These findings suggest that mobile interventions may have the potential to impact
SITBs on a large scale.

Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) are a major
public health problem. Suicide accounts for an estimated one
million worldwide deaths each year, making suicide responsible
for more deaths than war, accidents, or AIDS (World Health
Organization, 2012). These deaths are in addition to an estimated 25 million annual nonfatal suicide attempts, many of
which result in serious medical injuries (Crosby et al., 2011).

The rates of these behaviors are exceeded by the annual prevalence of suicide plans (0.6%) and ideation (3%) (Kessler et al.,
2005). Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI; e.g., cutting or burning
without suicidal intent) is even more common, with estimates of
prevalence rates ranging for 5% to 17% in general populations
and more than 50% in certain clinical populations (see Swannell
et al., 2014).

TEC FOR SELF-INJURIOUS BEHAVIORS 545


Given the scope and seriousness of this problem, a tremendous
amount of research has been devoted to the development of effective SITB interventions over the last several decades. Unfortunately, few interventions have proven effective and even the most
promising interventions have produced mixed results (Brown &
Jager-Hyman, 2014; Glenn, Franklin, & Nock, 2015). Regardless
of their efficacy, most existing interventions are inherently limited
in their ability to reduce SITB rates on a large scale. This is
because their in-person model of delivery, which typically involves a therapist and client (or group of clients) meeting face-toface on a weekly basis for an hour, constrains the potential impact
of these treatments in several ways (Kazdin & Rabbitt, 2013).
First, there is approximately one therapist for every 100 mentally
ill individuals; accordingly, even if all therapists practiced
evidence-based treatments, there would still be little change in
national and international rates of SITBs. Second, this model of
delivery is often costly in terms of time, money, and client effort.
These cost barriers prohibit many individuals from accessing treatments (Mojtabai et al., 2011; Sareen et al., 2007). Third, this model
of delivery is unable to overcome one of the most common barriers
to accessing treatment: the desire to handle one’s own problems
(i.e., the autonomy barrier; Mojtabai et al., 2011; Sareen et al.,
2007).
These barriers help to explain why most individuals with SITBs
do not receive treatment (Bruffaerts et al., 2011), which in turns
helps to explain why there has been little change in SITB rates
over the last several decades (Kessler et al., 2005; Nock, Borges,
et al., 2008a). These patterns show a clear need for the development of effective SITB interventions that can overcome availability, cost, and autonomy barriers. The present series of studies
represent initial steps toward this goal. Specifically, these studies
evaluated the first iterations of a novel web app designed to reduce
SITBs by targeting two recently identified SITB risk factors.
The first treatment target is the diminished aversion to SITBrelated stimuli (e.g., blood, wounds, knives, skulls, etc.). Whereas
most people find these stimuli extremely aversive, many people
who engage in SITBs find these stimuli neutral or even pleasant
(Franklin, Lee, Puzia, & Prinstein, 2014; Joiner, 2005). This diminished aversion may be partially explained by pain offset relief
conditioning during episodes of self-injury (Franklin, 2014; Franklin et al., 2013; Franklin, Lee, et al., 2014; Franklin, Puzia, Lee, &
Prinstein, 2014). Although pain itself is unpleasant, the removal of
pain generates a powerful state of relief; any stimuli present during
this relief (e.g., blood, wounds) acquire a more positive valence.
Recent evidence indicates that this diminished aversion to SITB
stimuli longitudinally predicts future SITBs above and beyond
several other competing predictors, including prior SITBs and
psychopathology (Franklin, Puzia, et al., 2014). According to
recent theories, the aversion to SITB stimuli creates a barrier that
dissuades most people from engaging in SITBs, and a reduction in
this barrier facilitates SITBs (Franklin, Lee, et al., 2014; Franklin,
Puzia, et al., 2014; Joiner, 2005). Based on this work, we hypothesized that increasing the aversion to SITB stimuli would reduce
future SITBs.
The second treatment target is aversion toward the self (i.e.,
one’s own representation of their identity or subjective experience). Most people have a positive association with the self (e.g.,
Koole et al., 2001), but many people who engage in SITBs show
aversion toward the self, as indicated by high levels of self

criticism and similar constructs in this population (e.g., Hooley &
Germain, 2014). Recent experimental work indicates that selfaversion may be a particularly important motivator of SITBs (e.g.,
Hooley & Germain, 2014). Specifically, this work suggests that
self-aversion generates the belief that one deserves pain, punishment, or death. In the absence of such beliefs, it may be much more
difficult for SITBs to occur. Correspondingly, we hypothesized
that decreasing self-aversion would reduce future SITBs.
Our preliminary work is consistent with these two treatment
target hypotheses. In a pilot study, Franklin (2014) attempted to
increase aversion to SITB stimuli by pairing these stimuli with
mildly painful electric shocks. Compared with a control group that
received shocks unpaired with SITB stimuli, a group that received
aversive conditioning (i.e., shocks paired with SITB stimuli) reported significantly fewer self-cutting behaviors over the ensuing
six months. Treatment response was significantly predicted by
increases in physiological aversion to SITB stimuli. Similarly,
Hooley and Germain (2014) found that a 5-min cognitive intervention aimed at improving self-worth normalized pain endurance
in a sample of individuals with a history of self-injury. Although
these preliminary findings are promising, one major limitation is
that these interventions are impossible to deliver on a large scale in
their present formats. Given their relatively simple proposed mechanisms of action (i.e., increasing aversion to SITB stimuli, decreasing self-aversion), however, we believed that these interventions
could be transformed into a simple format amenable to large-scale
dissemination.
For the present series of studies, we built on this preliminary
work to place these two potential interventions into a single, novel
evaluative conditioning paradigm. Evaluative conditioning is a
form of Pavlovian conditioning that occurs when the liking (i.e.,
evaluation) of one stimulus changes as a result of its pairing with
another stimulus (e.g., Hofmann et al., 2010). For example, the
liking of a picture of a blue triangle may change if it is repeatedly
paired with a picture of a spider. Evaluative conditioning has
traditionally been employed to study changes in attitudes toward
neutral stimuli in social psychology (see Hofmann et al., 2010), but
more recently has been applied to study clinical phenomena (e.g.,
Houben et al., 2010). Although there is a wide range of evaluative
conditioning procedures (see Hofmann et al., 2010), most involve
the simultaneous or sequential pairing of pictures or words. These
paradigms are typically short (�100 trials), passive (watching
stimuli on screen), and administered a single time in a laboratory.
As described in more detail below, we created a modified evaluative conditioning procedure that has an engaging, game-like design and is meant to be played many times outside of the laboratory on a mobile device. We call this procedure Therapeutic
Evaluative Conditioning (TEC). In the present series of studies, we
designed TEC to increase aversion to SITB-related stimuli (pairing
these stimuli with unpleasant stimuli) and to increase liking of
self-related words (pairing these words with pleasant stimuli).
Across all studies, we hypothesized that TEC would cause decreases in SITBs.

### Study 1


In Study 1, we tested TEC within a sample of individuals with
a recent history of frequent NSSI. We focused on this population
in our initial study because our pilot work focused on this popu

lation and NSSI is prevalent, frequent, and strongly associated
with a range of SITBs (see Franklin & Nock, in press). Participants
were randomly assigned to receive access to an active version of
TEC (“active group”) or a control version of TEC (“control
group”), and were allowed to access the appropriate version of the
TEC app as much as they desired over a one-month period.
We hypothesized that, compared with the control group, the
active group would display reductions in self-cutting and overall
NSSI. Given the specificity of this version of TEC to self-cutting,
we expected milder treatment effects for suicide ideation, plans,
and behavior. We additionally hypothesized that any treatment
effects would remain significant after controlling for stringent
covariates including prior month SITBs, emotion reactivity, internalizing symptoms, recent psychiatric treatment (both psychosocial and pharmacological), desire to stop engaging in NSSI, and
self-prediction of future NSSI.
Secondary analyses explored a range of other potential effects,
including the effect of active TEC dosage on SITBs and whether
any treatment effects persisted during the month after TEC access
ended. We also hypothesized that active TEC would impact its
intended treatment targets (i.e., diminished aversion to NSSI stimuli; heighted aversion to self-related words) and that changes in
these treatment targets would be associated with SITB reductions.
Finally, we explored the possibility that reductions in SITBs would
be accompanied by compensatory increases in non-SITB dysregulated behaviors.

### Method


**Participants.** Participants were 114 individuals (80.70% female) recruited from online web forums that focused on topics
relating to self-injury or psychopathology. To be eligible to
participate, individuals had to meet the following criteria: (a) 18
years of age or older; (b) English fluency; and (c) two or more
episodes of self-cutting in past month. Most participants were
young adults (M � 23.02 years old, SD � 5.47) and most
identified as Caucasian (81.57%), with the remaining identifying as Asian (6.14%), Black/African American (1.75%), Hispanic (1.75%), or Other (8.77%; e.g., mixed race). Most par

ticipants were living in the United States (n � 96), with the
remaining living in Canada (n � 2), Europe (n � 12), Asia (n �
3), and Australia (n � 1). The majority of participants reported
a history of psychiatric treatment (lifetime: 76.31%; past
month: 55.26%), many reported a history of inpatient psychiatric treatment (lifetime: 29.82%; past month: 3.50%), and
50.87% were currently on psychiatric medication. Participants
were randomly assigned via a random sequence generator to
either the control group (which received access to the control
TEC, n � 59) or the active group (which received access to
active TEC, n � 55). There were no significant demographic or
treatment history differences between the two groups (all ps �
.05). Groups reported similar baseline levels of each of SITBs
and covariates (see Table 1), with the exception of significantly
fewer prior month suicide plans in the active group (B ��.29,
_SE �_ .09, p � .001). CONSORT flow diagrams for each study
are presented as Supplemental Figures S1 through S3.
**Therapeutic evaluative conditioning (TEC).** We designed
TEC to be a brief, game-like treatment that could be accessed by
any device with an Internet connection. We aimed for TEC to be
accessed multiple times a day at the convenience of the user.
Several TEC characteristics promoted this aim: It takes 1 to 2 min
to complete a single instance of TEC; TEC becomes more challenging as the trials progress; points are awarded for faster and
more accurate performance; each instance of TEC is unique,
increasing replay value; and although TEC was primarily intended
as a mobile app, it includes a responsive design that allows it to
automatically format itself for phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops (see Figure 1 and Supplemental Method for a detailed description of TEC). For the present study, we included a version of
TEC that targeted self-related words (e.g., me, myself, I, mine) and
SITB-related stimuli that primarily depicted self-cutting (in Studies 1 and 2) or suicide/death stimuli (in Study 3).
**Measures.**
**_Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI;_**
**_Nock et al., 2007)._** The SITBI is a structured interview that
assesses the presence, frequency, and characteristics of selfinjurious thoughts and behaviors. As in previous studies (e.g.,

Franklin, Puzia, et al., 2014), in the present series of studies we
employed an online self-report version of the SITBI. The online
and in-person versions of the SITBI produce very similar estimates of SITB status and frequency (see Franklin, Puzia, et al.,
2014). We used the SITBI to measure the following: selfcutting (defined as number of times someone has cut themselves); overall NSSI (i.e., moderate NSSI behaviors: selfcutting, burning, hitting, inserting objects under the skin, and
scraping; see Franklin, Lee, et al., 2014; Franklin, Puzia, et al.,
2014); suicide ideation (defined as number of days during
which ideation occurred); suicide plans (defined as number of
days during which plans occurred); and suicidal behaviors
(defined as the number of nonfatal attempts, interrupted attempts, and aborted attempts).
We additionally used the SITBI to measure self-prediction of
the likelihood of future NSSI (1 to 5 scale; 1 � definitely not, 5 �
definitely) and desire to stop engaging in NSSI (1 to 5 scale; 1 �
no desire, 5 � extreme desire). Finally, we used the SITBI to
measure demographic and psychiatric treatment history (i.e., both
psychosocial and pharmacological). At baseline, the SITBI was
used to assess thoughts and behaviors over one’s lifetime, past
year, past month, and past week. During the treatment month of the
study, the SITBI was administered weekly and the timeframe was


past week; during the posttreatment month, the SITBI was administered monthly and the timeframe was past month.
**_Emotion Reactivity Scale (ERS; Nock, Wedig, Holmberg, &_**
**_Hooley, 2008)._** The ERS is a single-factor 21-iterm self-report
scale that measures emotion reactivity, a construct that includes
emotional sensitivity, intensity, and persistence. It is strongly
correlated with measures of emotion dysregulation, psychopathology, and SITBs (Franklin et al., 2013; Franklin, Lee, et al., 2014;
2014b; Nock, Wedig, et al., 2008), has been shown to mediate the
association between psychopathology and self-injury (Nock,
Wedig, et al., 2008), and demonstrated excellent reliability in the
present series of studies (Cronbach’s alphas � .93 to .95). We
employed the ERS as a covariate in treatment analyses.
**_Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; Derogatis, 2000)._** The BSI is
an 18-item self-report measure of past week psychological distress
that includes items pertaining to internalizing symptoms such as
anxiety, depression, and panic. The BSI has demonstrated strong
construct validity and displayed excellent reliability in the present
series of studies (Cronbach’s alphas � .88 to .92). As with the
ERS, we included the BSI as a covariate in treatment analyses.
**_Index of Dysregulated Behaviors (IDB)._** We created the IDB
for the present study. It is an 18-item self-report measure of
engagement in a wide-range of dysregulated behaviors over the

past month. Behaviors assessed include alcohol abuse, drug abuse,
reckless driving, binge eating, purging behaviors, food restriction,
abusive relationships, shoplifting/stealing, anger outbursts (e.g.,
provoking fights, breaking things, setting things on fire), unsafe/
reckless sexual behavior, and gambling (beyond small bets). We
included this measure to test the possibility that reduction in one
dysregulated behavior (i.e., NSSI) would be compensated for by
increases in other dysregulated behaviors (e.g., alcohol use, reckless behaviors).
**_Treatment targets: Implicit aversion to NSSI, death/suicide,_**
**_and the self._** We measured implicit affect with a brief computerbased task called the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP;
Payne & Lundberg, 2014; see Supplemental Materials for more
information). The present series of studies operationalized treatment targets as AMP scores for stimulus categories related to NSSI
(Studies 1 and 2), death/suicide (Study 3), and self-related words
(all three studies).
**Procedure.** All procedures were approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Harvard University.
**_Recruitment._** Similar to other recent self-injury studies (e.g.,
Lewis & Michal, 2015), participants were recruited from online
web forums (n � 12) that focused on discussions of self-injury and
related phenomena. Advertisements did not explicitly describe the
study as a treatment study. The informed consent form made clear
the treatment-related aspects of the study, but did not provide
details about TEC that would have allowed participants to discern
whether or not they were in the active or control group. This
procedure was designed to reduce placebo effects and to more
effectively target our intended population—the large number of
individuals who engage in SITBs but do not actively seek treatment.
The web-based recruitment strategy provided several advantages. First, it improved speed of recruitment, ease of contact,
comfort disclosing psychological and behavioral problems, attention to study instructions, geographic diversity, and number of
potential participants (e.g., Casler et al., 2013; Hauser & Schwarz,
2015). On balance, however, online recruitment presents unique
challenges that have the potential to threaten the quality of research (e.g., bots, study comprehension assurance). Over the past
decade researchers have developed several innovative recruitment
procedures and protocols to overcome these challenges (e.g., Bull
et al., 2008; Ip et al., 2010). In part because of these procedures,
several recent studies have found that online and in-person recruitment procedures produce nearly identical results across a wide
range of tasks and populations (Casler et al., 2013; Crump et al.,
2013; Hauser & Schwarz, 2015).
Second, instead of confining recruitment to a specific hospital or
city, this recruitment strategy allowed us to recruit from our
primary population of interest—the worldwide SITB population
with an Internet connection. In particular, we were most interested
in individuals with highly frequent SITBs who were not currently
benefiting from traditional treatments. Third, it ensured that participants were regular Internet users. As TEC is web-based, this
improved the odds that participants would regularly access TEC
and complete follow-up assessments. Fourth, the large pool of
potential participants made it possible to select for individuals with
recent and frequent NSSI. Using traditional methods, it is difficult
to recruit a large number of such participants. Fifth, compared with


local community recruitment methods, it provided greater confidence in the validity of Participant SITB status.
Building on best practice recommendations for online recruitment (e.g., Bull et al., 2008; Ip et al., 2010), we employed a five
step recruitment process (see Supplemental Method for a detailed
description).
**_Design, participation, and compensation._** Assessments occurred at baseline, weekly during the treatment month, and at the
end of the posttreatment month. All individuals participated anonymously. Participants were asked to provide an email address that
did not include identifiable information. Through this e-mail address, participants received automatic e-mails with links to
follow-up surveys and were compensated via electronic Amazon
gift cards. Participants were compensated $10 for baseline assessments, $5 for each weekly assessment during the treatment month,
and $20 for the posttreatment month assessment. Additionally,
participants were compensated based on their TEC performance:
one cent for each TEC point, up to $50 (5,000 points; the average
participant would need to play TEC �90 times to accrue this many
points). The six participants with the highest point totals (who also
completed each study assessment point) were compensated an
additional $100.
**_Implementation of TEC._** Participants were allowed to access
TEC as often as they desired over the course of one month (i.e., the
“treatment month”). We employed this ‘open dosage’ design for
two reasons. First, we wanted TEC use in the present study to
approximate real world usage. As such, we did not want to artificially constrict the frequency or timing of usage. Second, because
TEC is a new intervention, it was unclear which TEC dosage level
would be effective. It is possible that a single dose (i.e., playing
TEC once) may be sufficient to reduce SITBs, but it is also
possible that SITB reductions would require hundreds of TEC
doses. The open design of the present study allowed us to explore
these patterns to establish an empirical basis for dosage guidelines
in future studies.
Each participant was given a unique ID number for the TEC
app. This app was linked to a relational database that automatically
stored TEC performance information including the number of
points, total correct and wrong matches, total time, and date for a
given instance of TEC.
**Data analytic plan.**
**_Retention rates and missing data._** We calculated retention
rates across each week during the treatment month and at the end
of the posttreatment month. We note here that there were no
significant group differences for retention rates across studies. To
determine the representativeness of nonmissing data, we conducted Little’s Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) test (see
each Results section for a detailed description of missingness).
This test was nonsignificant in all three of the present studies (all
_ps �_ .99), suggesting that data were missing completely at random. Although this indicated that effect estimates based on nonmissing data were likely accurate and unbiased, we analyzed
imputed data to provide additional assurance that these estimates
were accurate. Imputation methods and results are described in
Supplemental Method and Table S1; nonimputed results are presented in the present paper, but we note here that imputed analyses
produced nearly identical results.
**_Outcomes._** Outcomes were SITBs, including self-cutting frequency, overall NSSI frequency (including self-cutting behaviors),


-----

days of suicide ideation, days of suicide plans, and suicidal behavior frequency. Suicidal behaviors included suicide attempts,
interrupted suicide attempts, and aborted suicide attempts. Selfcutting was examined separately from other NSSI behaviors because it is the most common form of NSSI, it is an unambiguously
severe form of NSSI, our inclusion criteria specified self-cutting,
and the present version of TEC primarily targeted self-cutting.
Because of the low frequency of suicidal behaviors, we report
these behaviors for each study but analyze them across all studies
after all other analyses.
Additional outcomes were changes in implicit affect toward
NSSI- and self-related stimuli, and changes in non-SITB dysregulated behaviors. These outcomes were calculated as the difference
between baseline and treatment month scores.
**_Statistical models._** SITBs are count variables that tend to
produce positively skewed distributions and an excess of zeros.
SITBs accordingly violate the assumptions of statistical techniques
based on a normal distributions. Fortunately, there are two common statistical models based on the distributions that SITBs tend
to approximate: zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression and zeroinflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression. These two models
are similar to one another except that ZINB includes an extra
parameter that accounts for overdispersion unrelated to excess
zeros (i.e., zeros that the model predicts have a 1.0 probability of
being a zero). In the present series of studies, for SITB outcomes
we only employed ZIP models when ZINB models indicated


nonsignificant overdispersion. We note here that both models
always provided very similar results in terms of significance and
effect magnitude. Both models produce incident rate ratios (IRRs),
which provide the ratio of the frequency of a given behavior in the
active group compared to the control group. These models are
described in more detail in Supplemental Method.
**_Overview of treatment-related analyses._** Given that TEC use
was self-selected, we were primarily interested in overall group
effects (i.e., effects where individuals were included in the active/
control TEC group analyses regardless of whether or how much
they accessed TEC). These tests resemble intention-to-treat tests,
but differ from such tests in that they do not include individuals
who did not participate at certain time point (true intention-to-treat
analyses with imputed data are provided in Table S1). We note
here that there were no significant group differences in app usage
participation across studies. All dosage analyses (i.e., analyses
based on active TEC points) and posttreatment month analyses
were exploratory.
**_Group effects for treatment month._** We tested whether group
(active vs. control) significantly predicted SITBs during the treatment month. Because of the trade-offs of our open design (e.g.,
self-selection of frequency and timing of usage, exploratory dosage hypotheses) and the high volatility of SITBs from week-toweek, we primarily focused on the month-based group treatment
analyses in the present series of studies. Monthly SITB frequencies
were calculated as the sum of SITB frequencies during each week

covariates (see Supplemental Tables S2–S4); without these covariates, treatment effects tended to be stronger
and there were significant treatment effects on overall NSSI outcomes in Study 3 (see Supplemental Table S1).

of the treatment month. Participants needed to complete each
weekly follow-up to allow for calculation of this monthly variable.
We conducted two levels of analyses for SITB outcomes. First,
we examined the effect of group on the outcome while including
the relevant baseline month SITB as a covariate (e.g., if suicide
ideation was the outcome, past month suicide ideation assessed at
baseline was included as a covariate). Second, we examined the
effect of group on the outcome while including the relevant baseline month SITB, ERS score, BSI score, baseline month treatment
status, and baseline self-prediction and desire to stop NSSI (for
self-cutting and NSSI analyses) as covariates. Only the latter
analyses are presented, but unless otherwise noted in the results
section, lower-order analyses produced nearly identical results in
terms of significance. For ease of interpretation, group effects for
the treatment month are presented in Figures 2 and 3; detailed
analyses of group and covariate effects are included in Tables S2
through S4.
We also examined the effect of group on changes in IDB scores
and treatment targets (i.e., implicit affect toward NSSI images and
self-related words). We then tested whether these latter two difference scores were associated with SITBs during the treatment
month. These latter analyses included the relevant baseline SITB
as a covariate.
**_Active TEC dosage effect analyses._** To explore potential dosage effects of active TEC, we calculated the proportion of participants who activated the active TEC app and how many points they


scored. Because points were so positively skewed (with a range of
nearly 20,000), we transformed points into three general active
TEC dosage categories. First, participants were placed in the no
dose group if they either (a) were assigned to the control group and
thus never had the opportunity to open the active TEC app or (b)
were assigned to the active group but never opened the app.
Second participants were placed in the low dose group if they
scored between 0.1 and 1,999 points in the active TEC app. Third,
participants were placed in the high dose group if they scored
2,000 or more points in the active TEC app. Results were similar
when more fine-grained class intervals were used (e.g., 4, 5, or 6
class intervals). Including the relevant baseline month SITB as a
covariate, we explored the effect of dosage on SITBs. We note
here that there were no significant dosage effects for control TEC
points in any study (all ps � .05); all presented dosage analyses
refer to the dosage of active TEC.
**_Posttreatment month analyses._** To explore whether any treatment effects persisted after TEC access ended, we examined the
effect of group on SITBs during the posttreatment month while
including the relevant baseline month SITB as a covariate. For
comparability, only participants included in treatment month analyses were included in posttreatment month analyses.
**_Suicidal behavior analyses._** Given the low base rates of suicidal behaviors over short intervals, we calculated suicidal behaviors over the course of both months of each study and conducted
analyses on combined behaviors from all three studies (descriptive

statistics for specific types of suicidal behaviors across studies and
groups is provided in Supplemental Table S6). Outcomes included
the number of individuals per group reporting any suicidal behaviors and the number of suicidal behaviors per group. We analyzed
group treatment effects as well as dosage group effects. Given the
relatively low frequency of suicidal behaviors, participants were
placed into one of two dosage groups: no active TEC dose (0
points), and any active TEC dose (.1 or more points).

### Results


**Descriptive statistics.**
**_Retention rates for follow-up assessments._** Retention rates
gradually dropped from weeks one to four (81.57%, 67.54%,
64.91%, and 60.52%, respectively), with 86.49% of participants
completing at least one follow-up during the treatment month and
52.25% of participants completing all follow-ups. Compared with
the control group (42.37%), a higher proportion of the active group
completed all treatment month follow-up assessments (60.00%).
However, nearly identical proportions of each group completed at
least one follow-up assessment during the treatment month (control group: 86.44%; active group: 87.27%). A total of 69.29% of
participants completed the posttreatment month follow-up, with
similar completion rates across groups (control group: 64.41%;
active group: 74.54%).
**_Treatment participation._** Most participants accessed their assigned version of the TEC app at least once (70.15%), with similar
proportions across groups (control group: 67.79%; active group:
73.36%). There were no significant group differences in TEC
points (p � .45), as both the control group (M � 1,311.99 points;
_SD �_ 2,764.54 points; Mdn � 161.85 points; Range � 19,181.90
points) and active group (M � 1,514.53 points; SD � 2,742.78
points; Mdn � 270.2 points; Range � 14,889.30 points) displayed
similar point distributions. In terms of active TEC dosage, 72
participants received no dose (i.e., assigned to control TEC or
assigned to active TEC but did not open the app), 29 received a
low dose (.1 to 1,999 points), and 13 received a high dose (2,000 �
points). As shown in Supplemental Figure S4, TEC usage was
highest during the first week, dropped during the second week and
slowly began to increase thereafter.
**Treatment analyses.**
**_Self-cutting._** During the treatment month, the active group
reported significantly fewer self-cutting episodes (i.e., count regression portion of the model; see Figure 2) and self-cutting
frequency decreased significantly as active TEC dosage increased
(B ��.38, SE � .07, IRR � .68, p � .001). The effect of active
TEC did not extend into the posttreatment month (p � .50).
**_Overall NSSI._** The active group reported significantly fewer
overall NSSI behaviors during the treatment month (see Figure 2),
with overall NSSI behaviors significantly decreasing as active
TEC dose increased (B ��.44, SE � .06, IRR � .64, p � .001).
This effect did not reach significance during the posttreatment
month (p � .16).
**_Suicide ideation._** Groups did not differ significantly on suicide ideation during the treatment month (see Figure 3) or posttreatment month (p � .17), and the dosage effect was not significant during the treatment month (p � .08).
**_Suicide plans._** As shown in Figure 3, the active group reported
significantly fewer suicide plans during the treatment month. As


with self-cutting and NSSI behaviors, there was a significant active
TEC dosage effect on suicide plans (B ��.40, SE � .17, IRR �
.67, p � .02). The active group continued to report significantly
fewer suicide plans during the posttreatment month (B ��.59,
_SE �_ .23, IRR � .55, p � .01).
**_Suicidal behaviors._** A total of nine participants reported at
least one suicidal behavior; five in the active group (producing 10
behaviors) and four in the control group (producing 19 behaviors).
Among participants who accessed the active TEC app at least
once, three reported at least one suicidal behavior (producing five
behaviors). Among participants who never accessed the TEC app,
six reported suicidal behaviors (producing 24 behaviors).
**_Non-SITB dysregulated behaviors._** There was no effect of
group on non-SITB dysregulated behaviors during the treatment
month (p � .42).
**_Treatment targets._** Analyses showed that, compared with the
control group (M � .09, SD � .22), the active group (M ��.04,
_SD �_ .21) displayed a significantly greater increase in aversion
toward NSSI stimuli during the treatment month, t(49) � 1.71, p �
.04, d � .60 (note: positive change scores diminished aversion
toward stimuli, negative scores indicate increased aversion toward
stimuli). Diminished aversion to NSSI stimuli during the treatment
month (i.e., the inverse of the present treatment target effect on
NSSI) was significantly associated with greater NSSI (B � 1.12,
_SE �_ .16, IRR � 3.06, p � .001), suicide ideation (B � .48, SE �
.19, IRR � 1.62, p � .02), and suicide plans (B � .68, SE � .32,
_IRR �_ 1.97, p � .04). There was no significant effect for selfcutting. These treatment target findings showed that TEC increased aversion to NSSI stimuli and that increased aversion was
associated with decreased in NSSI, suicide ideation, and suicide
plans.
The active group (M ��.05, SD � .27) showed a significantly
smaller drop in positive affect toward self-related words compared
to the control group (M ��.17, SD � .24), t(49) ��1.77, p �
.04, d � .47. Diminished aversion toward the self (i.e., the present
treatment target effect for self) was associated with less selfcutting (B ��2.49, SE � 1.10, IRR � .08, p � .02), NSSI
(B ��.77, SE � .17, IRR � .46, p � .001), suicide ideation
(B ��1.02, SE � .20, IRR � .36, p � .001), and suicide
plans (B ��.92, SE � .36, IRR � .40, p � .01). These results also
indicated that TEC diminished aversion to self-related words and
that this was associated with reductions in self-cutting, NSSI,
suicide ideation, and suicide plans.

### Discussion


Results indicated that active TEC had a positive impact on most
SITBs. We hypothesized that active TEC would produce reductions in self-cutting and overall NSSI, but expected much milder
effects on other SITBs and limited evidence of dosage and posttreatment month effects. Findings exceeded these expectations as,
compared with the control version of TEC, the active version of
TEC significantly reduced self-cutting (37% reduction), overall
NSSI (43% reduction), and suicide plans (45% reduction), even
after for including several powerful covariates. There were also
fewer suicidal behaviors in the active group, especially among
those who played active TEC at least once (see below for suicidal
behavior analyses/discussion across all three studies).


-----

### 552 FRANKLIN ET AL.


Exploratory analyses revealed that treatment effects for some
SITBs became more powerful as active TEC dosage increased.
Notably, even individuals who received a high dosage of active
TEC (i.e., 2,000 points or more) played TEC for less than an hour
total during the treatment month. This suggests that relatively
infrequent use of TEC (e.g., once per day, 15 min per week) may
be effective. However, few treatment effects remained significant
during the posttreatment month, indicating that persistent TEC
effects may require consistent TEC use. As hypothesized, TEC
appeared to impact its intended treatment targets—particularly
aversion toward NSSI stimuli, and greater changes in these treatment targets were associated with greater reductions in SITBs.
Contrary to findings for other SITBs, there was no effect of active
TEC on suicide ideation, suggesting that TEC may primarily
impact more active/behaviorally focused SITBs. Taken together,
these findings suggest that TEC may generate moderate reductions
in SITBs in a short amount of time.
The present findings are promising, but we emphasize that they
should be interpreted with caution. In addition to several general
limitations of the present series of studies (see General Discussion
below), it should be kept in mind that many individual studies
often either overestimate effects or cannot be replicated (e.g.,
Ioannidis, 2005). It is especially difficult to replicate findings of
studies with small samples and highly variable outcomes (e.g.,
SITBs). Although the present findings were consistent with our
preliminary work (Franklin, 2014; Hooley & Germain, 2014) and
hypotheses, we attempted to replicate these findings to obtain a
more accurate estimate of the true effects of TEC.

### Study 2


We designed Study 2 to be a close replication of Study 1, with
a few minor modifications. First, we altered the unpleasant stimuli
in the active version of TEC to make them more disgusting and
fear-inducing. We hypothesized that this change would increase
the potency of TEC by more powerfully conditioning negative
associations with SITB-related stimuli. Second, consistent with
evidence that most replication studies are underpowered (McShane
& Bockenholdt, 2014), we recruited slightly more participants.
Third, to retain more participants for treatment month effects, we
included past month SITB questions in the week four follow-up
assessment. Fourth, we enacted procedures designed to encourage
increased retention rates (e.g., compensating participants immediately after assessment completions via Amazon.com). Fifth, we
distinguished between self-cutting/NSSI episodes and events.
These alterations are described in more detail below. Study 2
hypotheses were identical to those of Study 1.

### Method


participate if they had participated in Study 1. Participants were
made aware of this criterion in study postings on forums and we
additionally excluded anyone with email addresses or Internet
Protocol addresses that were duplicates from Study 1 (n � 0). The
majority of participants were young adults (M � 22.91 years old;
_SD �_ 4.99) and the majority identified as Caucasian (83.21%),
with the remaining identifying as Asian (5.34%), Hispanic
(3.82%), Native American (1.53%), or Other (6.12%). Most participants were living in the United States (n � 107), with other
participants living in Canada (n � 1), Europe (n � 19), Asia (n �
1), Africa (n � 1), and Australia (n � 2). As in Study 1, most
participants reported a history of psychiatric treatment (lifetime:
81.68%; past month: 46.56%), many reported a history of inpatient
treatment (lifetime: 29.77%; past month: 3.05%), and nearly half
were currently on psychiatric medication (45.80%). Participants
were randomly assigned to either the control group (n � 69) or the
active group (n � 62). There were no significant demographic or
treatment history differences between the groups (all ps � .05).
There were no significant group differences on SITBs or covariates, with the exception of significantly higher suicide ideation in
the active group (B � .18, SE � .05, p � .001; see Table 1).
**Stimuli.** Study 1 included a broad range of unpleasant stimuli
within the active version of TEC (and the AMP). In an effort to
increase the potency of TEC, in the present study we only included
unpleasant stimuli that were disgusting (e.g., infected toenails) or
fear-inducing (e.g., close up of cluster of spiders). These images
were a combination of IAPS pictures and Creative Commons Zero
pictures from the Internet.
**Data analytic plan.** The data analytic plan was similar to that
of Study 1, with two exceptions. First, we distinguished between
self-cutting/NSSI episodes (i.e., discrete periods when someone
self-injurers; this could include a single cut to the skin or hundreds
of cuts to the skin) and self-cutting/NSSI events (i.e., individual
instances of actual or attempted tissue damage during an episode).
After Study 1, we realized that some participants may interpret
questions about self-cutting/NSSI frequency to refer to episodes
whereas others may have interpreted these questions as referring to
events. In SITBIs for Studies 2 and 3, we separately defined and
assessed episodes and events, thereby adding two additional SITB
outcomes. As shown in Table 1, there were marked differences in
the frequency of self-cutting/NSSI episodes and events, with
events being 4 to 5 times more frequent. Second, we assessed past
month SITBs at the week four follow-up to increase the number of
participants that could be included in treatment month analyses.

### Results


Aside from the aforementioned changes and the minor details
noted below, the measures, procedures, and data analytic plan were
identical to Study 1.
**Participants.** Participants were 131 individuals (74.05% female) recruited from online web forums primarily devoted to the
discussion of topics related to self-injury or psychopathology. We
recruited from a total of nine forums (out of nine forums that
we requested to post advertisements on). Inclusion criteria were
the same as for Study 1, except that individuals were ineligible to


**Descriptive statistics.**
**_Retention rates._** Retention rates were improved from Study 1,
with smaller drops in retention from weeks one to four (84.73%,
82.44%, 74.81%, and 73.38%, respectively), 90.84% of participants completing at least one follow-up during the treatment
month, and 64.89% of participants completing all follow-ups.
Unlike Study 1, all participants who completed the week four
follow-up were able to be included in treatment month analyses
(n � 96), with very similar completion rates across groups (control
group � 75.36%; active group � 70.97%). A total of 71.75% of
participants completed the posttreatment month follow-up assessment (control group � 75.36%; active group � 67.74%).

TEC FOR SELF-INJURIOUS BEHAVIORS 553


**_Treatment participation._** Compared with Study 1, a greater
proportion of participants accessed the TEC app (90.84%), with
high access rates in both groups (control group � 92.75%; active
group � 88.71%). There were no significant group differences in
points (p � .33), but the control group (M � 1,737.99, SD �
2,924.59; Mdn � 500; Range � 21,271.30) averaged more points
than the active group (M � 1,482.92, SD � 2,088.06; Mdn �
546.55; Range � 8,881.00). In terms of active TEC dosage, 76
participants received no dose, 39 received a low dose, and 16
received a high dose. Active TEC points were highest during the
first week (though much lower than in Study 1), with points
diminishing during the second week and leveling off thereafter
(Figure S4).
**Treatment analyses.**
**_Self-cutting episodes._** The active group reported significantly
fewer self-cutting episodes during the treatment month (see Figure
2), and episodes dropped significantly as active TEC dose increased (B ��.15, SE � .05, IRR � .86, p � .001). However, this
treatment effect did not persist during the posttreatment month
(p � .67).
**_Self-cutting events._** There was no effect of group (see Figure
2) or active TEC dosage (p � .58) on self-cutting events during the
treatment month. Likewise, there was no group effect on selfcutting events during the posttreatment month (p � .53).
**_Overall NSSI episodes._** During the treatment month, there
was no effect of group (see Figure 2) or active TEC dosage (p �
.44), and no group effect during the posttreatment month effects
(p � .59).
**_Overall NSSI events._** As with self-cutting events, there was no
effect of group on overall NSSI events during the treatment month
(see Figure 2) or posttreatment month (p � .72), and there were no
dosage effects (p � .87).
**_Suicide ideation._** There was no significant effect of group (see
Figure 3) or dosage (p � .95) on suicide ideation during the
treatment month. However, the active group reported significantly
more days of suicide ideation during the posttreatment month (B �
.50, SE � .20, IRR � 1.65, p � .01). It is important to note that the
active group did not report an increase in suicide ideation relative
to baseline. Both groups showed declines in ideation across the
course of the study (see Table S5); the present results indicate that
the active group’s decline in ideation during the posttreatment
month was less steep than that of the control group.
**_Suicide plans._** There was no significant effect of group (see
Figure 3) or dosage (p � .75) on suicide plans during the treatment
month. Similar to suicide ideation analyses, however, the active
group reported significantly more days of suicide plans during the
posttreatment month (B � .85, SE � .35, IRR � 2.34, p � .02). As
with suicide ideation, both groups displayed declines in suicide
plans across the course of the study (see Table S5). The present
analyses indicate that the active group’s decline in suicide plans
during the posttreatment month was less steep than that of the
control group.
**_Suicidal behaviors._** Four participants in the active group reported at least one suicidal behavior (producing 14 behaviors)
whereas eight participants in the control group reported at least one
behavior (producing 21 behaviors). Among participants who accessed the active TEC app at least once, three reported at least one
suicidal behavior (producing eight behaviors); among participants


who never accessed the active TEC app, nine reported at least one
behavior (producing 27 behaviors).
**_Non-SITB dysregulated behaviors._** As in Study 1, there was
no effect of group on non-SITB dysregulated behaviors during the
treatment month (p � .68).
**_Treatment targets._** Contrary to the findings of Study 1, there
were no group effects on change in implicit affect toward NSSI
stimuli (p � .33) or self-related words (p � .47), and change in
implicit affect was not significantly associated with any SITB
outcome (ps � .05).

### Discussion


Study 2 partially replicated some of the findings from Study 1,
but produced much weaker results overall. Similar to Study 1, the
active group displayed significant reductions in self-cutting episodes (40% reduction) that increased as active TEC dosage increased. Also similar to Study 1, the active TEC group displayed
fewer suicidal behaviors, with individuals who played the active
TEC app at least once reporting 70% fewer suicidal behaviors
compared to those who did not play the app. Contrary to hypotheses, there were no significant effects on self-cutting/NSSI events.
This suggests that TEC may primarily impact the number discrete
instances that someone decides to engage in self-injury (i.e., episodes) rather than the number of times someone attempts to
damage their tissue across all episodes (i.e., events). Also contrary
to hypotheses, the active group displayed significantly higher
suicide ideation and plans compared to the control group during
the posttreatment month. As noted above, however, both groups
displayed reductions in suicide ideation and plans during the study
(see Table S5); reductions in the active group were less steep than
those of the control group. Finally, unlike Study 1, the present
study did not detect a significant effect of TEC on its intended
treatment targets.
There are many possible explanations for the reduced effects
observed in Study 2. One possibility is that the changes to active
TEC (i.e., more disgusting and fear-inducing images) altered the
effects of active TEC. Another possibility is that the present
control group was more engaged and motivated than the active
group. However, the most likely explanation for these divergent
effects is chance. Study effects are drawn from a distribution of
potential effects. Across hundreds of studies, most effects will
cluster near a mean, but by chance many effects will be substantially above or below this mean. This between-studies heterogeneity is likely to be especially common among small studies and
highly variable outcomes (e.g., SITBs). With just two studies, it is
unclear whether Study 1 provided overly optimistic effect estimates, Study 2 produced overly pessimistic effect estimates, or
both. In part to address this question, we conducted a third study.

### Study 3


Study 3 was an extension of Studies 1 and 2, with one major
change: it was primarily suicide-focused. SITB-related targets in
the active version of TEC were primarily suicide-related (rather
than NSSI-related) and participants were recruited on the basis of
suicidal behavior rather than NSSI. Hypotheses were the same as
those from Studies 1 and 2, except that we expected stronger
effects on suicide-related outcomes and milder effects on NSSIrelated outcomes.

### Method

**Participants.** Participants were 163 individuals (58.89% female) recruited from online web forums that focused on topics
related to suicide and psychopathology. We recruited from a total
of nine forums (27 were contacted, 14 did not reply, four said no).
Inclusion criteria were similar to Studies 1 and 2, except that
participants were required to report at least one suicidal behavior
within the past year and were not eligible to participate if they had
participated in either of the prior studies (n � 0). Most participants
were young adults (M � 24.50 years, SD � 6.61) and most
self-identified as Caucasian (82.21%), with the remaining identifying as Hispanic (6.13%), Asian (4.91%), Black/African American (1.84%), Native American (1.23%), or Other (3.68%). The
majority of participants were living in the United States (n � 138),
with others living in Canada (n � 7), Europe (n � 14), Asia (n �
3), and South America (n � 1).
Similar to Studies 1 and 2, most participants had a history of
psychiatric treatment (lifetime: 71.78%; past month: 40.49%),
many reported a history of inpatient treatment (lifetime: 32.51%;
past month: 1.80%) and nearly half were currently taking psychiatric medication (42.94%). Participants were randomly assigned to
either the control group (n � 85) or active group (n � 78). There
were no significant group differences on any demographic or
treatment history variables, with the exception of age, F(1, 161) �
4.70, p � .03. The control group (M � 25.61, SD � 7.26) was
slightly older than the active group (M � 23.42, SD � 5.40), and
we note here that this factor did not alter the magnitude or
significance of analyses when entered as a covariate. There
were no group differences for any baseline SITB or covariate
(see Table 1).
**Stimuli.** Non-SITB stimuli were the same as those from Study
2. Rather than SITB stimuli depicting only NSSI, the present study
included SITB stimuli related to pill overdose (n � 4), hanging
(n � 2), jumping from heights (n � 2), pointing a gun at one’s own
head (n � 2), self-cutting (n � 2), skulls/bones (n � 2), and the
words “death” and “suicide.” All stimuli were either created by our
group (words and self-cutting pictures), taken from the IAPS, or
Creative Commons Zero images from the Internet.
**Design.** The design of the present study was similar to that of
Studies 1 and 2, except that participants were allowed continued
access to (and compensation for) TEC during the second month of
the study. This allowed us to explore whether (or to what degree)
TEC use patterns declined over a longer period of time and what
effect this might have on SITBs. To maximize comparability with
prior studies, the data analytic plan remained the same, with
analyses primarily concentrated on the first month of the study.


### Results

**Descriptive statistics.**
**_Retention rates for follow-up assessments._** Retention rates for
Study 3 were comparable with those of Study 2, with rates gradually diminishing from weeks one to four (81%, 79.1%, 71.8%,
and 67.5%, respectively). A total of 84.47% of participants had
data for at least one follow-up during the first month, and 60.87%
had data on all month one follow-ups for all assessments. A total
of 55.21% of the sample completed the month two follow-up. As
with Study 2, the present month one SITB-based analyses are
based on month-based estimates of SITBs assessed during the


week four follow-up (control group: 68.24%; active group:
65.38%).
**_Treatment participation._** TEC usage was between that of
Studies 1 and 2, with 78.53% of participants accessing the TEC
app at least once during the first month (control group: 78.82%;
active group: 78.20%). There were no significant group differences in TEC points during the first month (p � .35), though the
active group (M � 1,434.85, SD � 3,081.06; Mdn � 273.65;
_Range �_ 21,841) scored more points than the control group (M �
1,054.73; SD � 1,867.07; Mdn � 165.20; Range � 7,882.90). As
in the two prior studies, TEC points were highest during the
first week. Thereafter, TEC points remained relatively high
during the second week and diminished across weeks three and
four (Figure S4).
TEC usage fell sharply during the second month, with only
36.02% of participants accessing the app. Both the active group,
_t(72) �_ 4.27, p � .001, and the control group, t(82) � 3.94, p �
.001, showed significant reductions in points from month one to
month two. Both groups showed similar low levels of play (active:
_M �_ 488.48, SD � 2,277.84, Mdn � 0, Range � 19,047; control:
_M �_ 355.84, SD � 1,340.04, Mdn � 0, Range � 11,431), with the
majority of participants receiving zero points.
**Treatment analyses.**
**_Self-cutting episodes._** The active group reported significantly
fewer self-cutting episodes during the first month (see Figure 2),
but there was no dosage effect (p � .22). The treatment effect did
not persist into the second month (p � .37).
**_Self-cutting events._** Analyses indicated significantly fewer
self-cutting events in the active group during the first month (see
Figure 2) and this effect persisted into the second month
(B ��.66, SE � .15, IRR � .52, p � .001); however, there was
no evidence of a dosage effect (p � .20).
**_Overall NSSI episodes._** Analyses that only controlled for prior
month NSSI episodes (vs. the full range of covariates) revealed
that the active group reported significantly fewer overall NSSI
episodes during the first month (see Table S1). However, this
effect was no longer significant when the full range of covariates
were included (see Figure 2; Table S2). There was no effect of
group on overall NSSI episodes during second month (p � .38),
and there was no evidence of a dosage effect (p � .65).
**_Overall NSSI events._** As with NSSI events, analyses that only
controlled for prior month NSSI events showed that the active
group displayed significantly fewer NSSI events during the first
month (see Table S1). But analyses including the full range of
covariates found that there was no effect of group on overall NSSI
events in the first (see Figure 2) or second month (p � .58), and
there was no dosage effect (p � .98).
**_Suicide ideation._** There was no effect of group (see Figure 3)
or dosage (p � .43) on suicide ideation during the first month, and
no effect of group during the second month (p � .12).
**_Suicide plans._** Analyses indicated a significant reduction in
suicide plans for the active group during the first month (see
Figure 3), but tests were nonsignificant for a dosage effect during
the first month (p � .09) and a group effect during the second
month (p � .07).
**_Suicidal behaviors._** Three participants in the active group
reported at least one suicidal behavior (producing five behaviors);
five participants in the control group reported at least one behavior
(producing 22 behaviors). Among participants who accessed the


-----

TEC FOR SELF-INJURIOUS BEHAVIORS 555


active TEC app, two reported at least one behavior (producing four
behaviors); among participants who never accessed the TEC app,
six reported at least one behavior (producing 23 behaviors).
**_Non-SITB dysregulated behaviors._** As in both previous studies, there was no effect of group on IDB scores (p � .74).
**_Treatment targets._** Similar to Study 1, the active group
(M ��.07, SD � .19) showed a significantly larger increase in
implicit aversion to SITB stimuli compared with the control group
(M � .03, SD � .21), t(79) � 2.22, p � .02, d � .50 (note: positive
change scores indicate diminished aversion toward stimuli, negative scores indicate increased aversion toward stimuli). Diminished
aversion to SITB stimuli (i.e., the inverse of the present treatment
target effect) significantly predicted more self-cutting episodes
(B � 2.86, SE � .79, IRR � 17.46, p � .001) and NSSI episodes
(B � 1.83, SE � .19, IRR � 6.23, p � .001). These findings
indicate that TEC increased aversion to NSSI stimuli and that this
increased aversion was associated with reduced self-cutting and
NSSI episodes. However, compared with the control group, the
active group did not display a significant increase in positive
implicit affect toward self-related words (p � .20).

### Discussion


**Dosage analyses.** We conducted these same analyses after
dividing participants into those who did and did not access active
TEC at least once (i.e., any dose vs. no dose). Significantly fewer
participants who received any dose of active TEC reported at least
one suicidal behavior (n � 8 out of 117 participants) compared
with those who received no dose (n � 21 out of 147 participants),
�[2](1) � 3.70, p � .02. Similarly, compared with the no dose group
(n � 74 behaviors from 147 participants), the any dose group
reported significantly fewer suicidal behaviors (n � 17 behaviors
from 117 participants), B ��1.24, SE � .30, IRR � .29, p � .001
(i.e., 71% reduction in suicidal behaviors after accounting for
excess zeros). This effect held when controlling for baseline month
suicidal behaviors (B ��1.12, SE � .31, IRR � .33, p � .001).
Although these effects are consistent with hypotheses and the
effect of TEC on other SITBs, much larger studies are needed to
provide a more reliable estimate of the effect of TEC on suicidal
behaviors.

### General Discussion


Study 3 extended the general TEC findings of Studies 1 and 2.
The overall pattern and magnitude of effects were in between those
of Studies 1 and 2, suggesting that these prior studies may have
respectively provided optimistic and pessimistic estimates of TEC
effects on SITBs. The active group displayed significant reductions for most SITB outcomes except suicide ideation (see Tables
S1 and S4, Figure 2), and NSSI effects were no longer significant
when accounting for the full range of covariates (see Table S1,
Figure 2). There was some evidence of a dosage effect, but very
little evidence that treatment effects extended beyond the first
month. The present study extends prior TEC findings to a modified
version of TEC (i.e., suicide-related stimuli) and a sample selected
on the basis of prior suicidal behavior.

### Suicidal Behavior Analyses Across All Three Studies


Although rates of suicidal behaviors were in the expected direction for each study, there were too few behaviors to conduct
reliable analyses within each study (see Table S6 for information
on specific suicidal behaviors). Accordingly, we collapsed suicidal
behaviors across each study to provide a more reliable assessment
of TEC on these behaviors. Given the low rate of behaviors,
however, these analyses should be considered exploratory and
preliminary.
**Group treatment analyses.** Combining data from all three
studies, more individuals in the control groups reported at least one
suicidal behavior (n � 17 of 135 participants) than in the active
groups (n � 12 out of 130 participants), but this difference was not
significant, �[2](1) � .73, p � .19. A significantly higher frequency
of suicidal behaviors was reported in the control groups (n � 62
behaviors from 135 participants) compared with the active groups
(n � 29 behaviors from 130 participants), B ��.71, SE � .26,
_IRR �_ .49, p � .01 (i.e., 51% reduction in the rate of suicidal
behaviors); however, this effect was no longer significant after
controlling for baseline month suicidal behaviors, B ��.49, SE �
.27, IRR � .61, p � .07).


There is a need for SITB interventions that overcome the barriers to large-scale treatment. The present series of studies represent the initial steps toward the development of such an intervention. The results of Study 2 were relatively weak, but aggregated
results across studies indicated that our brief, game-like app reduced self-cutting episodes, overall NSSI episodes, suicide plans,
and suicidal behaviors. Notably, most of these reductions remained
in the context of several powerful covariates—including prior
month SITBs—that significantly predicted SITBs during the treatment month. Also of note, participants were not made aware of
how TEC might work and qualitative debriefing interviews indicated that participants did not ascertain TEC’s intended mechanisms of action. These findings suggest that TEC is a brief (i.e.,
1–2 min), low effort, game-like intervention that stimulates moderate reductions in most SITBs in a short amount of time.
Although these findings are promising, several other findings
make clear the need for improvements that can increase TEC
potency, identify additional treatment targets, and increase user
engagement. First, despite reductions in most SITBs, no study
showed a significant treatment effect on suicide ideation. Second,
even though group effects were reliable, there was mixed evidence
that greater use of TEC was associated with greater SITB reductions. Third, treatment effects rarely persisted after TEC cessation
(i.e., after month one of each study). Fourth, there was mixed
evidence that TEC engaged its intended treatment targets, with
TEC primarily impacting the diminished aversion to SITB stimuli
target rather than the self-aversion target.
These latter results only partially support the hypothesized
mechanisms of action for TEC, but they also highlight the promise
of targeting a novel risk factor—the diminished aversion to SITB
stimuli (or, capability for SITBs). The Benefits and Barriers Model
of NSSI (Franklin, Lee, et al., 2014; Franklin, Puzia, et al., 2014)
and the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (Joiner,
2005) both note this as a critical SITB ingredient. The present
results suggest that the capability to enact nonsuicidal and suicidal
self-injury is not an immutable trait; rather, it appears to be a
malleable risk factor that reduces SITBs when appropriately targeted.

### 556 FRANKLIN ET AL.


Along with limitations related to the present findings, several
methodological limitations should be kept in mind when interpreting the results of the present study. First, all participants were
recruited via online forums that focused on topics related to
self-injury, suicide, and psychopathology. The present samples
accordingly may have been biased in terms of desire and ability to
engage in a web-based treatment. On balance, these samples were
drawn from our major population of interest—the worldwide population of individuals with Internet access and a history of SITBs.
Nevertheless, it would be helpful to replicate the present findings
in large samples recruited from the community, local clinics, and
inpatient units. Given the high concordance between in-person and
Internet-based studies (e.g., Casler et al., 2013; Crump et al., 2013;
Hauser & Schwarz, 2015) and the consistency of the present
findings and with our in-person preliminary studies (Franklin,
2014; Hooley & Germain, 2014), we would expect similar findings
across the two types of studies.
Second, an additional sampling-related limitation was that participants were primarily young adults. This is a very important
population as all SITBs (with the exception of suicide death) are
particularly common among this age group. However, it will be
important to replicate the present findings in adolescents and older
adults. This may require modifying stimuli to be appropriate for
adolescents and modifying the nature of the intervention (i.e.,
app-based) to be more appropriate for elderly adults. Third, the
present studies were large compared with most SITB treatment
studies, but it would be helpful to replicate the present findings in
a much larger sample (e.g., �10,000 participants). This would
allow for more reliable estimates of TEC effects on very low base
rate behaviors (e.g., specific types of suicide attempts) and provide
sufficient power to examine moderators of TEC effectiveness.
Fourth, we paid participants to use TEC. It is unclear whether
(or to what degree) participants would use TEC in the absence of
such compensation. Given that the control group and active groups
were both paid for TEC use and accessed their respective versions
of TEC at similar rates, this payment issue is unlikely to account
for the present treatment effects. Nevertheless, for feasibility purposes, studies are needed to test TEC use in the absence of
monetary compensation and to determine which factors best predict TEC use. Fifth, across studies, 70% to 90% of participants
opened the TEC app (whether active or control); these figures are
encouraging but far from our ideal treatment engagement rate of
100%. To improve on this limitation, future versions of TEC must
be modified in several ways to increase its potency, reinforcing
qualities, and ability to impact SITBs on a large scale. For example, we are working on new versions that include a much higher
number (and greater variety) of stimuli, greater variations in difficulty, integration of ecological momentary assessments that allow for personalization and optimization algorithms to tailor TEC
to each individual across time, and a feature that automatically
translates TEC into a wide range of languages.
Sixth, TEC use and dosage were self-selected. This self-directed
use approximates how TEC might be used in the real world, but it
also leaves open many questions about how assigned TEC dosage
may affect SITBs and what the optimal dosage of TEC might be.
Future studies would benefit from exploring these important questions. Seventh, the present study primarily examined TEC effects
over the course of a single month and results indicated that the
effects of TEC likely do not persist long after TEC cessation.


Furthermore, month two results from Study 3 suggest that TEC use
may have to be fairly regular (e.g., at least once per week) to
produce significant benefits. Future studies should evaluate
whether improvements such as personalization algorithms and
additional gamification elements generate more TEC use and more
lasting TEC effects. Eighth, the active group displayed a less steep
decline in suicide ideation and plans during the posttreatment
month of Study 2. Given that similar patterns were not observed in
Studies 1 or 3, these may be chance findings. However, it will be
important for future studies to more thoroughly investigate the
possibility of adverse TEC effects.
Ninth and finally, the present version of TEC was only designed
to impact SITBs. Indeed, results indicated the TEC did not affect
a range of other dysregulated behaviors. This suggests that the
effects of TEC were specific and did not generate any compensatory dysregulated behaviors. Ideally, however, TEC would have a
much broader impact. Given its design and underlying principles,
TEC could be modified to target a wide range of psychological
issues, especially those that can be clearly represented by specific
images or words.
These significant limitations notwithstanding, the present series
of studies indicates that TEC is a promising intervention for SITBs
that has the potential overcome many of the traditional barriers to
mass dissemination of treatment. With further testing and continued improvement, TEC may eventually extend beyond its present
limitations and have the potential to generate large-scale reductions in SITBs and other psychopathological phenomena. Given its
format, TEC could contribute to such reductions as either an
add-on to existing treatments or as a low-cost, highly disseminable
standalone intervention.
