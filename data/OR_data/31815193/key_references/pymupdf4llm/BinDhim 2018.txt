# Smartphone Smoking Cessation Application (SSC App) trial: a multicountry double-blind automated randomised controlled trial of a smoking cessation decision-aid ‘app’

## Nasser F BinDhim,[1,2] Kevin McGeechan,[2] Lyndal Trevena[2]


Smoking cessation programmes are accessible to only 15% of the population globally[2] despite more people attempting to
quit. Approximately two-thirds of smokers
in the USA attempted to quit in 2014,[3] 11%
of male Chinese smokers mainly aged 15–24
years attempted to quit[4] and a range of tobacco-control policies have been increasing quit
attempts in low-income and middle-income
countries.[5] We also know that most quit
attempts are likely to be unassisted[6] and that
the reasons for this may relate to personal
and societal values of independence and
autonomy which influence smokers’ beliefs
and decisions about quitting.[7]

Mobile phone interventions have become a
new but effective way to help smokers quit. A
recently updated Cochrane review[8] includes
12 studies, showing that these, mainly text
message-based interventions, significantly
improved continuous abstinence at 6 months
compared with control[9] interventions of
information only. The authors also remarked
on the lack of research on smartphone applications (apps) despite the plethora of these
available to the public. As we have previously
shown, a smartphone app was able to reach

**Abstract**
**Objective To assess the efficacy of an interactive smoking**
cessation decision-aid application (pp) compared with a
smoking cessation static information app on continuous
abstinence.
**Design Automated double-blind randomised controlled**
trial with 6 months follow-up (2014–2015).
**Setting Smartphone-based.**
**Participants 684 participants (daily smokers of**
cigarettes, 18 years old or over) recruited passively from
app stores in the USA, Australia, UK and Singapore, and
randomised to one of two sub-apps.
**Intervention(s) Behavioural, decision-aid, smartphone**
application.
**Main outcome(s) Continuous abstinence at 10 days,**
1 month, 3 months and 6 months.
**Results Smokers who received the decision-aid app**
were more likely to be continuously abstinent at 1 month
compared with the information-only app (28.5% vs 16.9%;
relative risk (RR) 1.68; 95% CI 1.25 to 2.28). The effect
was sustained at 3 months (23.8% vs 10.2%; RR 2.08;
95% CI 1.38 to 3.18) and 6 months (10.2% vs 4.8%; RR
2.02; 95% CI 1.08 to 3.81). Participants receiving the
decision-aid app were also more likely to have made
an informed choice (31.9% vs 19.6%) and have lower
decisional conflict (19.5% vs 3.9%).
**Conclusion A smartphone decision-aid app with support**
features significantly increased smoking cessation and
informed choice. With an increasing number of smokers
attempting to quit, unassisted evidence-based decision-aid
apps can provide an effective and user-friendly option to
many who are making quit decisions without healthcare
professionals.

**Introduction**
Just over one-fifth of the world’s adult population continues to smoke despite significant declines in smoking rates over the
past decades.[1] Smoking is responsible for
the deaths of around 6 million people per
year and costs the global economy around
US$500 billion annually.[1]


**Strengths and limitations of this study**



- This is the first fully powered efficacy trial of a
smoking cessation decision-aid application (app).

- The design deliberately reflects the real-world
setting recruiting through app stores.

- It compares ‘state-of-the-art’ decision-aid design
and support with passive information-only apps.

- The trial was a novel fully automated design across
four countries.

- The decision-aid with support app significantly
improved continuous abstinence at 6 months
compared with information-only app.


-----

1751 smokers in the USA, Australia and the UK over
a period of 12 months. Most of these people were not
seeking professional help and were ready to quit in the
next 30 days.[10]

Smartphones with their advanced processing capabilities, rapid global uptake, proximity to the user and
push notifications (a short message service-like function
that is free of cost and more interactive),[11] are potentially
an ideal vehicle for health interventions.[12] In addition,
smartphone apps have shown feasibility across diverse
ranges of health conditions.[10 13–15] Although app stores
have hundreds of smoking and tobacco-related apps, the
majority are of low quality, very few provide evidence-based
content and some are actually pro-smoking apps.[9 16 17]

The efficacy of smartphone apps as an intervention
for smoking cessation remains untested, although three
small pilot studies have shown a potential effect on shortterm abstinence rates.[13 18 19] This study, the Smartphone
Smoking Cessation Application (SSC APP) trial, therefore, is the first that we are aware of to assess the efficacy
of a SSC APP in a full-scale, multicountry, longer-term
trial. It tests the efficacy of an interactive smoking cessation decision-aid app compared with a smoking cessation
static information app on quit rates.

**Methods**
**Study design**
This is an automated, double-blind, randomised
controlled trial (RCT) to determine the efficacy of a
smartphone smoking cessation decision-aid app with
support features compared with an app that contains only
smoking cessation information. An overarching app was
developed that included the baseline questionnaire and
two sub-apps—the intervention and control apps. The
participants from the USA, Australia, Singapore and the
UK were randomised over a 5-month period. These countries were selected because of high smartphone coverage,
English language, high income and good access to
smoking cessation treatments across different geographical regions globally.[10] The study app was published on
the Apple App Store during the recruitment period
and was the main portal of advertising the trial. We also
advertised the app as an (in-app) advertisement to Apple
iPhone users while they are using other apps, allowing for
demographic targeting.

**Participants**
Users of the Apple App Store in the four countries were
recruited passively via the app’s download page in the
Apple App Store. The App Store description advised them
that by downloading the app they would be participating
in the study, that they could read the provided information about smoking and options for quitting, complete
a questionnaire to find out their nicotine dependency
test score and rate the information for its helpfulness in
motivating them to quit. The app would collect anonymous data about how often the app was used and how


long it was used for, and their internet protocol (IP)
address would be collected only to identify duplication
of data in our database and then deleted permanently.
No personal identifying information would be collected
through the app or the questionnaire. All anonymous
data including the questionnaire responses, information
ratings, frequency/duration of use and IP address would
be sent directly from the app in their phone to an online
secure research database. The eligibility criteria were
daily smokers of cigarettes, 18 years old or over and from
the included countries. Occasional smokers and users of
other tobacco products were excluded.

**Patient involvement**
Patients were not directly involved in the design of this
study. However, a previous study has explored the potential participants’ characteristics to inform this study
design.[9]

**Baseline registration and data collection**
When a participant opened the app for the first time, the
app assigned them a unique device identifier and registered the user’s smartphone device in our secure remote
database. The unique device identifier could not change
if the user deleted the study app and reinstalled it. This
allowed anonymous data collection, prevented duplicate
enrolments and contamination between groups. As this
study is fully automated, not being able to ensure that
some users may download the app from another device
is an unavoidable limitation. However, to monitor users
who download the app onto two devices, we have implemented a server-side IP that can identify the users who use
different devices connected to the same internet network
at similar times. This may not completely eliminate the
possibility of contamination but will reduce it. To increase
the response rate to the baseline questionnaire, we have
implemented a reminder function that will send a notification to the user to complete the baseline questionnaire.
The baseline questionnaire included sociodemographic
variables (age, sex, educational level, marital status and
income level) and tobacco consumption (eg, number of
cigarettes smoked per day and nicotine dependence as
measured by the Fageström test).[20]

**Randomisation and blinding**
The study app automatically randomised eligible participants (daily cigarette smokers, aged 18 years and above
and from the four countries) to either the intervention
or the control sub-app using stratified block (age, gender,
country) randomisation. The strata were defined by age,
country and gender. Participants and all investigators
were blinded to group allocation (double blind).

**Intervention and control app components**
Both apps motivated the participant to set a quit date.
The intervention app included four main components
that made optimal use of smartphone features: (1)
mandatory information about quitting options, with their
benefits and harms; (2) daily motivational messages using


-----

push notifications sent from the study server, (3) a quitting diary and (4) a quitting benefits tracker. The intervention app could thus be described as a smartphone
‘decision aid with additional support’ because it included
structured content on the options, benefits and harms
of smoking cessation, along with ongoing support and
motivation for the implementation and adherence to a
quit decision through the use of push notifications, motivational messages, a diary and benefits tracker. Unlike
many existing smoking cessation services through mobile
phones and quit-lines, the decision-aid app allowed
smokers to freely choose a quit method through a structured process of weighing up the available options and
their benefits and harms. The decision-aid design was
based on the Ottawa Decision Support Framework that
draws on a number of psychological and behavioural
[theories (https://​decisionaid.​ohri.​ca/​odsf.​html).](https://decisionaid.ohri.ca/odsf.html)
The control app included non-mandatory information about quitting options, benefits and harms, similar
to those available in the intervention app. It did not
provide any structured process for considering options,
benefits and harms of quitting methods nor did it provide
ongoing support for adherence to a quit decision. This
could therefore be described as a smartphone app with
information only. As stated earlier, both the intervention
and control apps encouraged users to set a quit date.
Full details about the study design, the intervention and
control apps are available in the published protocol.[12]
A public version of the intervention app called ‘Quit
Advisor Plus’ is available for downloading free of charge
from the Apple App Store.
The follow-up data were collected by pushing a notification to the participants that were received even if
the app was not running. Participants could also click
on a follow-up button inside the app to initiate the
follow-up process if the follow-up time had come. The
follow-up notification generated an automated process
where participants could click ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to answer the
follow-up questions.

**Outcomes**
The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who remained completely abstinent after 1 month.
Participants were asked the question “Have you been
totally smoke-free (‘not even a puff’) for the last x days/
months?” at 10 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.
Secondary outcomes were the proportion who made
quitting attempts of at least 24 hours, abstinence rates
at 10 days, 3 months and 6 months, the proportion who
made an informed choice (based on the Multidimensional Measure of Informed Choice (MMIC)— 10 days
after quitting) and the proportion with low decisional
conflict (SURE score of less than 4 measured 10 days after
quitting).[21]

**Statistical analysis**
We calculated a sample size of 672 participants to achieve
80% power at a 0.05 significance level to detect a change


in continuous abstinence after 1 month from 5% to 15%
allowing for 20% loss to follow-up.[12] All analyses were
undertaken on an intention-to-treat basis. To account for
the non-responses at follow-up, four multiple imputation
models were constructed for the non-responses at the
follow-up at 10 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months
continuous abstinence. The covariates that were included
in the models were age, gender, educational level,
income level, nicotine dependence, intervention group,
selected quitting method and country. Ten imputed datasets were generated based on Rubin’s formula for relative efficiency to produce about 99% efficiency.[22] We also
conducted a sensitivity analysis with the assumption that
all participants with missing outcome data were smokers.[23]
Effect measures were relative risk (RR) and 95% CIs. We
assessed whether the effect of the intervention on abstinence rates was mediated by choice of quitting method
or use of particular app components such as the use of
the benefit tracking function by applying the method of
Baron and Kenny.[24]

**Results**
The recruitment process started on 5 May 2014 and
continued until the required sample size was reached on
1 September 2014. The 684 participants were randomly
assigned via our automated randomisation algorithm to
the intervention or control group (figure 1). Treatment
groups were balanced with respect to baseline characteristics (table 1). χ[2] analysis to examine the non-response at
1-month follow-up association with intervention groups
revealed that non-response was independent of the
intervention groups χ[2](1, n=684)=1.2, P=0.27. However,
turning off the app push-notification function (8.6% of
the participants) was associated with non-response χ[2](1,
n=684)=11.1, P<0.001.
The majority of participants in both groups decided to
quit unassisted, followed by nicotine replacement therapy
(NRT) (table 1). Only 2.3% of the participants changed
their selected quitting method within the first 10 days.
The multiple imputations results showed that self-reported continuous abstinence at 10 days, 1, 3 and
6 months was significantly increased by the intervention
app (table 2). At 1 month, 28.5% of those in the intervention arm were completely abstinent compared with
16.9% in the control arm. Similar results were obtained
when the participants who were lost to follow-up were
treated as smokers (table 3) at the main outcome 1 month
(continuous abstinence 13.2% (45/342) control vs 26.0%
(89/342) intervention; RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.79,
P<0.001), and when excluded (table 3) (continuous abstinence 14.2% (45/317) control vs 27.4% (89/325) intervention; RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.66, P<0.001).
In three countries, abstinence rates at 1 month were
significantly higher in the intervention group compared
with the control group (USA (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.04 to
3.25), Australia (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.64), UK (RR
1.97, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.55), but not Singapore (RR 1.56,

95% CI 0.71 to 3.44). There was no statistically significant
difference in the effect of the intervention _between the_
countries.
The effect of quitting method on continuous abstinence at 1 month was assessed in a logistic regression
analysis using the imputed data adjusting for age, gender,
educational level, country, treatment groups. None of
the quitting methods were associated with abstinence
compared with ‘No treatment (quitting unassisted)’.
The quitting method did not mediate the impact of the
intervention since method chosen was not associated
with abstinence (P=0.99) and inclusion of method did
not alter the estimate of the intervention effect.
Finally, we measured the effect of ‘app component
use’ on quitting, using a logistic regression model with
the imputed data at 1 month and 6 months. The model
included the quitting benefit tracker use, quitting diary


use and the self-reported reading of the compulsory
information adjusting for age, gender, educational
level, country, quitting support method. Only the quitting benefit tracker was significantly associated with
continuous abstinence at 1 month (OR 3.85; CI 2.15
to 6.91) and 6 months (OR 4.27; CI 1.53 to 11.88).
Mediator analysis was not preformed because the quitting benefit tracker was only available in the intervention
app which violated the mediation analysis assumptions.
In terms of the decisional conflict, 19.5% of the participants in the intervention group had low decisional
conflict compared with 3.9% in the control group χ[2](1,
n=684)=28.4, P<0.001. Table 4 shows the MMIC at 10 days
after quitting with participants receiving the decision-aid
app more likely to make an informed choice than those
getting the information-only app (31.9% vs 19.6%), χ[2](1,
n=684)=12.8, P<0.001.

**Discussion**
The results of this fully automated RCT show that continuous abstinence from smoking at 1, 3 and 6 months was
significantly increased by a smartphone decision aid that
included behavioural support compared with a simple
non-mandatory information-only app. Most of the participants chose to quit via ‘No treatment (unassisted)’ with


intervention recipients being more likely to make an
informed choice and have lower decisional conflict than
those receiving the information-only app. We have also
shown that smartphone apps can be successfully used in
an RCT design, with good follow-up response rates in
both groups. Turning off the app push notification was
associated with follow-up non-response.
We believe our intervention app was successful in
achieving the 28.5% 6-month continuous abstinence
rates because it combined features of previously evaluated smoking cessation interventions that were shown
to be effective—that is, decision aids and mobile phone
interventions. Willemsen _et al[25] conducted an RCT of a_
smoking cessation decision aid over a decade ago. While
the aid increased 6-month continuous abstinence rate
to 20.2% compared with no decision aid (13.6%), it
consisted of a box with leaflets, a video and some treatment samples which were posted to the home. The
researchers reported an increase in knowledge, a more
positive attitude, an increase in confidence about quitting
and feedback that the decision aid helped them decide
on a quit method. Second, there has been increasing
evidence for the efficacy of mobile phone interventions
(mainly text messages or counselling).[8] We hypothesise
that our 6-month abstinence rate of 28.5% is due to the
combined effect of decision support and the convenience
of mobile technology. In addition, the effect of smartphone-unique features on health behaviour change has
not yet been assessed and this study is the first to do so.[10]

**Strengths**
A strength of our intervention was that it incorporated
patient decision-aid features which significantly increased
the proportion of people who made an informed choice
that was concordant with their personal values and significantly reduced decisional conflict about their quit decision. Comparing our results to a previous paper-based
smoking cessation decision-aid RCT,[25] our study has also
shown comparable results at short-term and long-term
follow-up period but has the added convenience of smartphone accessibility.
Importantly, about 56.0% of the participants in this
study (in both groups) had made a previous quit attempt
that had lasted at least 24 hours. This is relatively consistent with our finding in the feasibility study where the
majority (75.6%) of participants who had used smoking
cessation apps in the past had made a quitting attempt
that lasted at least 24 hours using an app.[10] It supports
the notion that smartphone apps are an effective way of
reaching serious ‘quitters’ who tend to quit ‘unassisted’.[25]
Interestingly, our study participants who used NRT had
similar results to those who quit unassisted. Although, this
study was not powered for subgroup analyses, our intervention was effective in three countries out of four.
Furthermore, 77.3% of those who downloaded the app,
completed the eligibility test and of those eligible, 92.2%
completed the baseline questionnaire. The introduction of the push notification reminders in this study may

have contributed to this high response rate, with other
studies reporting similar results with this method.[15 26] By
contrast, our feasibility study only generated a response
rate of 36.8% without reminders.[10] Our trial retention
rate was good with 1-month follow-up (93.9%) and
6-month follow-up (85.2%). Another study comparing
a smartphone app with a website found that trial retention was 93% at 6 months in the smartphone group,
compared with 55% in the website group.[14] Turning off
the app push-notification feature was associated with loss
to follow-up. In future, the app could include an in-app
reminder to the user to turn on the push notification.

**Limitations**
One of the limitations of this study is that continuous
abstinence was measured via self-report through the app
questionnaires, which is less rigorous than a biochemically
verified abstinence.[27] Our study was not funded for the
latter. The second limitation is the possibility of contamination between groups, although we took measures to
minimise this through the unique IP feature.[12] Finally, we
recognise that the participants in this study were likely to
be more motivated than other smokers because they were
searching for smoking cessation apps during the recruitment period.

**Generalisability**
This study has used a novel approach for conducting an
automated RCT via a smartphone app, and thereby simulated the ‘real-world’ setting, recruiting via the app store
in multiple countries. This automated process eliminated


hours of recruitment time, and cost, it reached various
ages, education levels and income groups, including 31%
of the participants with low incomes but still used an
expensive smartphone device. However, the study sample
was limited to four high-income countries, and the findings may not be generalisable to smokers with smartphones in other settings.

**Future challenges**
Unlike web technology where the intervention can be
developed and hosted on the producer’s resources,
smartphone apps are hosted on the publishers’ servers
(eg, Apple app store or Google Play) and thus subjected
to their changing regulation policies and technical
specifications. For example, in this project the app was
released on an iPhone operating system version that did
not require the user to provide permission to receive
local notifications (used in the quitting benefit tracker
function). However, new versions of the iPhone operating system required the app producer to implement a
user permission function to use local notifications. In this
case, some users may disable the local notifications and
the utilisation may be reduced. Thus, future interventions may need to come up with new solutions to improve
the utilisation of specific app functions. The same issue
was faced in another project that uses the location detection function to follow-up travellers for infection control
purposes.[28]

Other smartphone operating systems such as Android
allows the app producer to publish their apps via email or

with behaviour.

self-hosted web links. Although the producer may lose the
mass exposure advantage by publishing their apps on the
official app stores, they at least can avoid the changing
policies issue.

**Conclusions**
A smartphone decision-aid app significantly increased
smoking cessation rates with greater informed choice
and lower decisional conflict across three out of four
countries. It shows that the benefits of earlier mobile
phone smoking cessation interventions can potentially be
transferred to the more contemporary and user-friendly
smartphone interface. We have also demonstrated the
feasibility of conducting an RCT entirely using smartphone technology. Evidence-based decision-aid apps
should be promoted to smokers who are thinking of
quitting.
