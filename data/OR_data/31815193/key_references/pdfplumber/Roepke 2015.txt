Abstract
Objective:Technologicaladvanceshavesparkedthedevelopmentofcomputer-andsmartphone-basedself-help
programs for depressed people, but these programs’ efficacy is uncertain. This randomized controlled trial
evaluated an intervention called SuperBetter (SB), which is accessed via smartphone and/or the SB Web site.
MaterialsandMethods:Online,we recruited 283adult iPhone(cid:2) (Apple, Cupertino,CA) userswith significant
depression symptoms according to the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression questionnaire (CES-D).
Theywererandomlyassignedtooneofthreeconditions:(a)aversionofSBusingcognitive-behavioraltherapy
and positive psychotherapy strategies to target depression (CBT-PPT SB); (b) a general SB version focused on
self-esteem and acceptance (General SB); or (c) a waiting list control group (WL). The two SB groups were
instructed to use SB for 10 minutes daily for 1 month. All participants completed psychological distress and
well-being measures online every 2 weeks through follow-up. An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted using
hierarchical linear modeling.
Results:Ashypothesized,SBparticipantsachievedgreaterreductionsinCES-DscoresthanWLparticipantsby
posttest (Cohen’s d=0.67) and by follow-up (d=1.05). Contrary to prediction, CBT-PPT SB did not perform
betterthanGeneralSB;bothversionsofSB weremoreeffectivethanthe WLcontrol.DifferencesbetweenSB
versions favored General SB but were not statistically significant.
Conclusions: These large effect sizes should be interpreted cautiously in light of high attrition rates and the
motivated,self-selectedsample.Nonetheless,smartphone-based/Internet-basedself-helpmayplayanimportant
role in treating depression.
