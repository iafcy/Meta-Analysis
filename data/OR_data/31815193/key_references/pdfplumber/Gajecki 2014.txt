a randomized controlled study

Abstract
Background: Brief interventions via the internet have been shown to reduce university students’alcohol intake.
Thisstudy tested two smartphone applications (apps) targeting drinking choices on party occasions, with the goal
ofreducing problematic alcohol intake amongSwedish university students.
