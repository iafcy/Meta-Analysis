Abstract
Background: Worldwide, depression is rated as the fourth leading cause of disease burden and is projected to be the second
leading cause of disability by 2020. Annual depression-related costs in the United States are estimated at US $210.5 billion, with
employers bearing over 50% of these costs in productivity loss, absenteeism, and disability. Because most adults with depression
never receive treatment, there is a need to develop effective interventions that can be more widely disseminated through new
channels, such as employee assistance programs (EAPs), and directly to individuals who will not seek face-to-face care.
Objective: This study evaluated a self-guided intervention, using the MoodHacker mobile Web app to activate the use of
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) skills in working adults with mild-to-moderate depression. It was hypothesized that MoodHacker
users would experience reduced depression symptoms and negative cognitions, and increased behavioral activation, knowledge
of depression, and functioning in the workplace.
Methods: A parallel two-group randomized controlled trial was conducted with 300 employed adults exhibiting mild-to-moderate
depression. Participants were recruited from August 2012 through April 2013 in partnership with an EAP and with outreach
through a variety of additional non-EAP organizations. Participants were blocked on race/ethnicity and then randomly assigned
within each block to receive, without clinical support, either the MoodHacker intervention (n=150) or alternative care consisting
of links to vetted websites on depression (n=150). Participants in both groups completed online self-assessment surveys at baseline,
6 weeks after baseline, and 10 weeks after baseline. Surveys assessed (1) depression symptoms, (2) behavioral activation, (3)
negative thoughts, (4) worksite outcomes, (5) depression knowledge, and (6) user satisfaction and usability. After randomization,
all interactions with subjects were automated with the exception of safety-related follow-up calls to subjects reporting current
suicidal ideation and/or severe depression symptoms.
Results: At 6-week follow-up, significant effects were found on depression, behavioral activation, negative thoughts, knowledge,
work productivity, work absence, and workplace distress. MoodHacker yielded significant effects on depression symptoms, work
productivity, work absence, and workplace distress for those who reported access to an EAP, but no significant effects on these
outcome measures for those without EAP access. Participants in the treatment arm used the MoodHacker app an average of 16.0
times (SD 13.3), totaling an average of 1.3 hours (SD 1.3) of use between pretest and 6-week follow-up. Significant effects on
work absence in those with EAP access persisted at 10-week follow-up.
Conclusions: This randomized effectiveness trial found that the MoodHacker app produced significant effects on depression
symptoms (partial eta2= .021) among employed adults at 6-week follow-up when compared to subjects with access to relevant
depression Internet sites. The app had stronger effects for individuals with access to an EAP (partial eta2= .093). For all users,
the MoodHacker program also yielded greater improvement on work absence, as well as the mediating factors of behavioral
activation, negative thoughts, and knowledge of depression self-care. Significant effects were maintained at 10-week follow-up
for work absence. General attenuation of effects at 10-week follow-up underscores the importance of extending program contacts
to maintain user engagement. This study suggests that light-touch, CBT-based mobile interventions like MoodHacker may be

appropriate for implementation within EAPs and similar environments. In addition, it seems likely that supporting MoodHacker
users with guidance from counselors may improve effectiveness for those who seek in-person support.
