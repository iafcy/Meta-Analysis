Objective:Posttraumaticstressdisorder(PTSD)ishighlyprevalentinthepopulation,butrelativelyfew
affected individuals receive treatment for it. Smartphone applications (apps) could help address this
unmetneedbyofferingsoundpsychoeducationalinformationandevidence-basedcognitivebehavioral
coping tools. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a free, publicly
available smartphone app (PTSD Coach) for self-management of PTSD symptoms. Method: One
hundred20participantswhowereanaverageof39yearsold,mostlywomen(69.2%)andWhite(66.7%),
recruitedprimarilythroughonlineadvertisements,wererandomizedtoeitheraPTSDCoach(n(cid:2)62)or
a waitlist condition (n (cid:2) 58) for 3 months. Web-administered self-report measures of PTSD, PTSD
symptom coping self-efficacy, depression, and psychosocial functioning were conducted at baseline,
posttreatment, and 3 months following treatment. Results: Following the intent-to-treat principle,
repeated-measuresanalysesofvariance(ANOVAs)revealedthatatposttreatment,PTSDCoachpartic-
ipantshadsignificantlygreaterimprovementsinPTSDsymptoms(p(cid:2).035),depressionsymptoms(p(cid:2)
.005),andpsychosocialfunctioning(p(cid:2).007)thandidwaitlistparticipants;however,atposttreatment,
there were no significant mean differences in outcomes between conditions. A greater proportion of
PTSDCoachparticipantsachievedclinicallysignificantPTSDsymptomimprovement(p(cid:2).018)than
waitlist participants. Conclusion: PTSD Coach use resulted in significantly greater improvements
in PTSD symptoms and other outcomes relative to a waitlist condition. Given the ubiquity of smart-
phones,PTSDCoachmayprovideawide-reaching,convenientpublichealthinterventionforindividuals
withPTSDsymptomswhoarenotreceivingcare.
