Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major public health concern. Although effective
treatmentsexist,affectedindividualsfacemanybarrierstoreceivingtraditionalcare.Smartphonesare
carriedbynearly2thirdsoftheU.S.population,offeringapromisingnewoptiontoovercomemanyof
these barriers by delivering self-help interventions through applications (apps). As there is limited
researchonappsfortraumasurvivorswithPTSDsymptoms,weconductedapilotfeasibility,accept-
ability, and potential efficacy trial of PTSD Coach, a self-management smartphone app for PTSD.
