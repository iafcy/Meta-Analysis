Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent in the population, but relatively few 
affected individuals receive treatment for it. Smartphone applications (apps) could help address this 
unmet need by offering sound psychoeducational information and evidence-based cognitive behavioral 
coping tools. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a free, publicly 
available smartphone app (PTSD Coach) for self-management of PTSD symptoms. Method: One 
hundred 20 participants who were an average of 39 years old, mostly women (69.2%) and White (66.7%), 
recruited primarily through online advertisements, were randomized to either a PTSD Coach (n (cid:2) 62) or 
a waitlist condition (n (cid:2) 58) for 3 months. Web-administered self-report measures of PTSD, PTSD 
symptom coping self-efficacy, depression, and psychosocial functioning were conducted at baseline, 
posttreatment, and 3 months following treatment. Results: Following the intent-to-treat principle, 
repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed that at posttreatment, PTSD Coach partic- 
ipants had significantly greater improvements in PTSD symptoms (p (cid:2) .035), depression symptoms (p (cid:2) 
.005), and psychosocial functioning (p (cid:2) .007) than did waitlist participants; however, at posttreatment, 
there were no significant mean differences in outcomes between conditions. A greater proportion of 
PTSD Coach participants achieved clinically significant PTSD symptom improvement (p (cid:2) .018) than 
waitlist participants. Conclusion: PTSD Coach use resulted in significantly greater improvements 
in PTSD symptoms and other outcomes relative to a waitlist condition. Given the ubiquity of smart- 
phones, PTSD Coach may provide a wide-reaching, convenient public health intervention for individuals 
with PTSD symptoms who are not receiving care. 
What is the public health significance of this article? 
There is a tremendous unmet need for care among trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress 
symptoms. This randomized controlled trial suggests that a self-management mobile app may be an 
efficacious intervention that can reduce PTSD and depression symptom severity and improve 
psychosocial functioning to help address this unmet need in the population.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common, with an esti- 
mated lifetime prevalence of 6.8% in the United States (Kessler et 
al., 2005). Many others experience significant symptoms but do 
not meet the diagnostic criteria, termed partial, subclinical, or 
subthreshold PTSD (Brancu et al., 2016). PTSD exacts a heavy toll 
in terms of compromised emotional well-being, interpersonal chal- 
lenges, and productivity loss (Kessler, 2000) and thus is a signif- 
icant public health problem. 
Evidence-based PTSD treatments exist (Foa, Keane, Friedman, 
& Cohen, 2009), but their availability is limited (e.g., Shiner et al., 
2013). In fact, few with PTSD receive any mental health care 
(Wang et al., 2005). Reasons for this include logistical concerns 
(e.g., cost) and beliefs about treatment seeking, such as worrying 
about what others might think and believing that one should handle 
it on one’s own (Kessler, 2000; Vogt, 2011). Furthermore, younger 
and ethnic minority individuals are less likely to seek care (Gavri- 
lovic, Schützwohl, Fazel, & Priebe, 2005). Lastly, in many areas, 
there are not enough mental health professionals to meet the need 
(Kazdin & Rabbitt, 2013). 
Thus, alternative approaches are needed, especially population- 
level interventions. Smartphones are ideal for delivering such 
interventions, as they are carried by 68% of U.S. adults (Anderson, 
2015). Ownership is higher in some populations with underserved 
mental health needs (e.g., young adults), and no apparent dispar- 
ities exist in ownership among minority groups, including Black 
and Hispanic individuals (Anderson, 2015). Furthermore, owner- 
ship among those with mental health issues mirrors that of the 
general population, and these individuals desire to use smart- 
phones to address mental health needs (Torous, Friedman, & 
Keshavan, 2014). 
To capitalize on this potential, the U.S. Department of Veterans 
Affairs and Department of Defense built the PTSD Coach app 
(Hoffman et al., 2011; Kuhn et al., 2014). PTSD Coach provides 
high-quality psychoeducation, PTSD symptom assessment using 
the PTSD Checklist—Civilian (PCL–C; Weathers, Litz, Herman, 
Huska, & Keane, 1993), evidence-informed self-management tools 
(e.g., relaxation exercises, stress inoculation training, and ground- 
ing), and convenient access to supportive others and professional 
resources. It is not intended to replace professional care, if needed, 
but is instead designed to improve health literacy, provide strate- 
gies for coping with PTSD symptoms, and provide strategies for 
managing acute distress. It is available for free in both the iOS 
(Apple) and Android app marketplaces. 
Evidence is accumulating regarding the benefits of using smart- 
phones to address mental health issues (Donker et al., 2013), but 
the extant research suffers from methodological shortcomings, 
including small samples, lack of control conditions and follow-up 
data, and little research focusing on PTSD. In preparation for the 
trial, we conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 
PTSD Coach, demonstrating its feasibility and acceptability 
(Miner et al., 2016). Its efficacy was inconclusive, as the study had 
a small sample (N (cid:2) 49) and a 1-month treatment period, resulting 
in a small estimated treatment effect (i.e., Cohen’s d (cid:2) 0.25). 
Therefore, for the current study, we hypothesized that participants 
randomized to 3 months using PTSD Coach would achieve sig- 
nificantly greater improvements in PTSD symptom severity (pri- 
mary outcome) and PTSD symptom coping self-efficacy (SE), 
depression severity, and psychosocial functioning (secondary out- 
comes) than those assigned to a waitlist condition. In addition, we 
hypothesized that 
3-month follow-up. 



One hundred twenty adults met eligibility criteria, consented, 
and were randomized. Eligibility criteria included being 18 years 
old or older, being fluent in English, owning a mobile device 
capable of using PTSD Coach, having been exposed to a traumatic 
event more than 1 month ago, scoring 35 or greater on the PCL–C 
(Weathers et al., 1993), and not currently being in PTSD treatment. 

Study procedures were approved by Stanford University’s In- 
stitutional Review Board. Enrollment began in February 2014, and 
data collection ended in May 2015. Recruitment occurred through 
advertisements about a study of an app for trauma survivors with 
PTSD symptoms using flyers (n (cid:2) 16), media coverage (n (cid:2) 10), 
social media (n (cid:2) 22), and Craigslist (n (cid:2) 72). Screening for 
eligibility occurred via an online questionnaire (n (cid:2) 189) or phone 
(n (cid:2) 131). Eligible individuals were e-mailed an online survey link 
(using Qualtrics) to a site where they provided informed consent 
and then completed the baseline assessment. Thereafter, they were 
randomized to conditions by the study coordinator using adaptive 
randomization, with the probability of condition assignment 
changing based on the assignment of participants already in the 
trial using www.randomizer.com. Three and 6 months later, they 
were e-mailed links to the posttreatment and follow-up assess- 
ments, respectively. They received $75 in major retail store gift 
cards for completing the three assessments. Figure 1 presents a 
flowchart of participants through the study. 

Primary outcome measure. PTSD symptoms were assessed 
with the PCL–C (Weathers et al., 1993), a 17-item self-report 
measure of DSM–IV PTSD symptoms (American Psychiatric As- 
sociation, 1994) with strong psychometric properties (Wilkins, 
Lang, & Norman, 2011). Items are rated on how much the symp- 
tom bothered the respondent in the past month on a scale ranging 
from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely), with the sum score ranging 
from 17 to 85 providing a symptom severity rating. 
Secondary outcome measures. PTSD symptom coping SE 
was assessed with a nine-item self-report measure developed for 
the study following Bandura’s (2006) guidelines. Items assess 
confidence in managing PTSD symptoms and reaching out for 
support on a scale from 0 (cannot do at all) to 100 (highly certain 
can do). The average score provides an overall measure of SE. 
Cronbach’s alpha at baseline was .87. Depression was assessed 
with the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ– 8; 
Kroenke et al., 2009), an eight-item self-report measure of depres- 
sion with evidence showing its ability to measure depression 
symptom severity and potential diagnosis. Items are rated on how 
much the symptom bothered the respondent in the past 2 weeks on 
a scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Total 
scores can range from 0 to 24. Cronbach’s alpha at baseline was 



.87. Psychosocial functioning was measured using the Brief In- 
ventory of Psychosocial Functioning (B–IPF; Erb et al., 2015), a 
seven-item self-report measure. Items are rated on how much 
trouble the respondent had in the past month in relationships or 
other important areas of functioning (e.g., work, training, or edu- 
cation) on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 6 (very much). An 
average of applicable items provides an index of psychosocial 
functioning. Cronbach’s alpha at baseline was .82. 
Other measures. The baseline survey included items about 
gender, age, race and ethnicity, education, and income. It also 
included the Life Events Checklist (Weathers, Keane, & Davidson, 
2001) to assess direct exposure (i.e., happened to me and wit- 
nessed) to 17 types of traumatic events. During screening, poten- 
tial participants described a traumatic event that caused them the 
most current distress, which was used as the index trauma for the 
PCL–C. At posttreatment, participants were asked if they received 
any professional treatment for PTSD. The iOS research version of 
PTSD Coach enabled objective monitoring of app use. All user 
behavior in the app (e.g., pages visited) was logged. Average days 
used per week (with any app activity qualifying as a day of use) 
served as the measure of objective app use. Technical problems 
prevented capture of usage data for the Android version. Self- 
reported usage data were collected using the following question: 
On average, how many days per week did you use the app? 
Response options ranged from 0 to 7 days. 

PTSD Coach condition participants were instructed to download 
the app and use it however they would like in an attempt to mimic 


real-world use. Users of iOS devices (n (cid:2) 33) downloaded the 
research version from a password-protected website and were 
informed that their app use would be monitored. Android device 
users were asked to identify an alternative iOS device (n (cid:2) 3), 
were lent an iPod touch (Model A1367, iOS 4.3; n (cid:2) 2), or were 
asked to download the app from the Google Play Store (n (cid:2) 24). 
PTSD Coach is a skills-based, nontrauma-focused intervention that 
includes four major sections: Learn, Self Assessment, Manage 
Symptoms, and Find Support. In the Learn section, information on 
trauma, PTSD, and treatment options is provided. In the Manage 
Symptoms section, users can practice cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT)– based tools for PTSD-related symptoms (e.g., progressive 
muscle relaxation, stress inoculation training for managing trauma 
triggers). In the Self Assessment section, users can complete 
assessments, schedule future assessments, and view past assess- 
ments of their PTSD symptoms using the PCL–C (Weathers et al., 
1993). Finally, the Find Support section allows users to connect 
with their own personal contacts and crisis and emergency services 
(e.g., the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, 911). The app 
allows personalization by offering users the ability to incorporate 
their own music, photos, and contacts into tools within the app. 
(For a more thorough description of PTSD Coach, please see the 
supplemental material.) 
Waitlist participants received no intervention during the treat- 
ment period. After the posttreatment assessment, they were told 
that the app being studied was PTSD Coach, that the app was 
available in the App Store and Google Play Store, and that they 
were now free to download and use it if they would like. 


repeated-measures analyses of variance 
(ANOVAs) were conducted to assess the Condition (cid:3) Time (base- 
line to posttreatment) interaction effects covarying report of PTSD 
treatment. Following the intent-to-treat principle, data from all 
randomized participants were analyzed, and multiple imputation 
was used to replace missing values, with 10 imputed data sets 
being generated. Averages of descriptive and inferential statistics 
computed across these data sets are presented. Cohen’s ds were 
calculated by dividing the between-group mean difference from 
baseline to posttreatment by the baseline-pooled standard devia- 
tion. Clinical significance was set as a decrease of 10 or more 
points on the PCL-C (Monson et al., 2008), and a chi-square test 
assessed the difference between conditions in the proportions 
meeting this threshold. A power analysis using G(cid:2)Power 3 soft- 
ware (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007) indicated that to 
achieve 80% power to detect an effect size in the magnitude (i.e., 
d (cid:2) 0.25– 0.33) of that evidenced in our pilot study (Miner et al., 
2016) with an alpha of .05 and a correlation between repeated 
measures of .5, 60 participants per condition would be needed. We 
hypothesized that extending the intervention period from 1 to 3 
months would increase the treatment effect, resulting in even 
greater power. 

Table 1 provides sample characteristics. No significant between- 
group differences were found on any of the outcomes at baseline 
(see Table 2) except the B–IPF, t(118) (cid:2) 2.60, p (cid:2) .009. There

did not differ at posttreatment, t(118) (cid:2) 0.22, p (cid:2) .828. Treatment 
effects appeared to be maintained based on the within-group 
change from baseline to follow-up for these latter two measures, 
PHQ– 8: t(61) (cid:2) 6.54, p (cid:5) .001; B–IPF: t(61) (cid:2) 4.10, p (cid:5) .001. 

In the PTSD Coach condition, 26 treatment completers used the 
iOS research version of the app, logging an average of 1.29 days 
of use per week (SD (cid:2) 0.77), which was significantly correlated, 
r (cid:2) .51, p (cid:5) .01, with their self-reported average days used per 
week (M (cid:2) 1.96, SD (cid:2) 1.46). Across all 51 PTSD Coach condi- 
tion completers, the self-reported average days used per week was 
2.27 (SD (cid:2) 1.76). Correlations between self-reported use and 
changes in outcomes were all not significant (p (cid:8) .05). 

This is the first study to our knowledge that has rigorously evalu- 
ated the efficacy of a mobile app for PTSD symptoms. The results 
support our main hypothesis, showing that 3 months of PTSD Coach 
use resulted in greater reductions in PTSD symptom severity com- 
pared to no intervention and that more PTSD Coach participants 
achieved clinically significant improvement compared to waitlist par- 
ticipants. Improvements shown in the PTSD Coach condition ap- 
peared to be maintained at follow-up, although the design precluded 
testing of between-group effects at that time point. The results also 
confirm our other hypothesis regarding broader benefits of PTSD 
Coach for depression symptoms and psychosocial functioning. How- 
ever, across all outcomes, there were no significant differences in 
means between conditions evidenced at posttreatment. 
Although effects are modest and clearly much smaller than have 
been found for evidence-based psychotherapies (Foa, Keane, Fried- 
man, & Cohen, 2009), this publicly available free app has vast 
potential to reach the sizable population of individuals with PTSD 
symptoms who are not receiving mental health care. The impact of 
public health interventions has been characterized as the product of 
their efficacy and reach (Abrams et al., 1996), so the overall impact of 
PTSD Coach could be quite large, especially if public health cam- 
paigns were launched to raise awareness in the population about 
PTSD and the app. 
These initial findings on the efficacy of PTSD Coach contribute to 
the scant but developing literature supporting the potential of smart- 
phone interventions to help address mental health symptoms. A recent 
meta-analysis (Lindhiem, Bennett, Rosen, & Silk, 2015) found that 
smartphone apps demonstrated the most powerful effects relative to 
other mobile interventions for behavioral health issues, although the 
superiority of effects was not statistically significant. For PTSD in 
particular, we were unable to find any RCTs that evaluated a smart- 
phone app other than our own pilot studies of PTSD Coach (Miner et 
al., 2016; Possemato et al., 2016). 
The mechanisms through which PTSD Coach may operate on 
outcomes are not clear. There was no significant relationship 
between app use and improvements in outcomes. PTSD Coach was 
informed by social– cognitive theory, which posits that enhancing 
skills and social support increases one’s confidence to meet chal- 
lenges, such as managing PTSD symptoms. However, app users 
did not show greater improvements in PTSD symptom coping SE. 
Further research is needed to assess if such theoretical targets are 
actually mediating outcomes. 
The current study had several strengths, including adequate power, 
a control condition, random assignment, a follow-up assessment, and 
relatively low attrition (i.e., 14%). Despite these, several limitations 
require consideration. First, there was an exclusive reliance on self- 
report measures, with a couple lacking strong psychometric evidence. 
Relatedly, a clinical interview was not used to assess PTSD. Second, 
objective app usage data were not available for all PTSD Coach 
participants. Although the correlation between the objective and self- 
reported data was fairly large, there was considerable discrepancy 
between these data sources. Third, use of a waitlist control did not 
provide the most stringent comparison (e.g., to control for possible 
digital placebo effects; Torous & Firth, 2016). Lastly, sample char- 
acteristics may limit to whom the findings would apply. Most notably, 
our sample was composed primarily of individuals who were women, 
White, and fairly well educated, with a majority reporting an index 
trauma of interpersonal violence. In addition, most participants were 
recruited online, possibly skewing our sample to be composed of 
those who are comfortable using technology. Thus, it is uncertain if 
the findings would replicate among other populations of trauma 
survivors (e.g., male combat veterans). 
In conclusion, our findings suggest that PTSD Coach holds prom- 
ise to help address the tremendous unmet need of trauma survivors 
with PTSD symptoms who are not receiving mental health care. 
Although PTSD Coach effects would be considered small to medium, 
the app could be a helpful first step toward recovery for some trauma 
survivors. PTSD Coach was primarily designed to increase ability to 
cope with trauma-related distress and not intended to treat PTSD 
symptoms or replace professional care, but early work suggests that it 
could have modest positive effects on PTSD and related symptoms. 
However, it is also clear that the benefits may not be robust enough to 
serve as the only care step for many with PTSD. Therefore, further 
development of PTSD Coach is needed to possibly enhance its po- 
tency. In addition, future research is required to determine if using 
PTSD Coach as self-management promotes (or possibly hinders) 
subsequent treatment seeking. Regardless, given the limited availabil- 
ity of existing treatment options and significant barriers to care at this 
time, PTSD Coach could help fill a gap that to date has not been 
adequately addressed.
