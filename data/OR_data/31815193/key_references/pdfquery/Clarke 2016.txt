Cognitivemodels of insomnia propose that attentional vigi- 
 
lance for threat during the pre-sleep period may play a causal role 
in insomnia by elevating physiological and psychological arousal 
to produce a state that is incompatible with the initiation of sleep 
[1] . Consistent with such theoretical accounts, studies have con- 
firmed that insomnia is associated with patterns of biased attention 
favouring sleep-related threatening information [2] . 
 
Converging research has shown that attentional bias assess- 

 
ment methodologies, such as the attentional probe task, can be 
converted to attentional bias modification (ABM) tasks. Using 
such tasks it has been shown that modification of biased attention 
for threat can achieve therapeutic benefits in conditions where this 
bias is implicated, including anxiety and mood disorders [3] . Of 
specific relevance to the current research is the observation that a 
single session of computer-based ABM can have immediate effects 
on anxiety and stress reactivity [3] . Therefore, we sought to assess 
whether targeted delivery of an ABM task during the pre-sleep pe- 
riod could reduce symptoms of insomnia and the cognitive symp- 
toms of pre-sleep arousal. 
Invitations were extended to individuals from the University of 

 
Western Australia School of Psychology participant pool who had 
identified worry-related insomnia as a problem (n = 236, n = 41 
accepted). Inclusion criteria (met by n = 36) were access to an 
iPhone, high levels of insomnia symptoms on the Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index (score ≥ 5 [4] ), completing at least 4 of 5 ABM/con- 
trol sessions during the study, and consistent accuracy on the at- 
tentional probe task (>70%). Participants were randomly allocated 
to the ABM (n = 18; 12 female) or control condition (n = 18; 15 
female). 
The study spanned 8 days (7 nights). The first 2 days served as 

 
a baseline period in which participants completed self-report mea- 
sures and wore the sleep monitor, but did not complete the ABM 
or control task. These initial baseline days were followed by 5 con- 
secutive ‘task completion days’ in which the participants complet- 
ed, immediately prior to bed, an ABM task (ABM condition) or a 
non-training control task (control condition) on their smart- 
phone. Both tasks employed 48 word pairs comprising sleep-relat- 
ed threat words paired with non-threat words. The task format was 
similar to standard ABM tasks used in prior studies [3] , with task 
parameters adapted for use on an iPhone. On each trial an initial 
fixation cross was followed by two vertically aligned words, one 
threatening sleep-related word and one neutral word. After 500 ms 
the word pair was replaced by a probe appearing in the location of 
one of the words. The participants discriminated probe identity 
(horizontally or vertically aligned dots) by tapping the correspond- 
ing horizontal or vertical arrow icon at the bottom of the iPhone 
screen. In the ABM condition, probes always appeared opposite 
the threat word to encourage attentional avoidance of sleep-relat- 
ed threat. In the control condition and on assessment trials, probes 
replaced the threat and neutral words with equal frequency, so as 
not to encourage any pattern of selective attention. On task com- 
pletion days 1–5, the participants completed 384 trials prior to 
sleep each night (approx. 15 min). Of these, 288 were ABM/control 
trials, and 96 were assessment trials randomly dispersed within the 
latter half of the ABM/control trials. An index of attentional bias 
to threat was computed across assessment trials in a manner con- 
sistent with past studies [3] . Further details of task parameters, 
stimulus creation, experimental methodology and additional dis- 
cussion of findings are available in supplementary online mate- 
rial via the following link: http://www.psychology.uwa.edu.au/re- 
search/care/research/ClarkePPS). 
On the first day of the study, the participants completed the 

 
trait version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [5] , the Penn 
State Worry Questionnaire [6] and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index [4] , while baseline attentional bias was assessed with 96 trials 
of the attentional probe assessment task. On all days, the partici- 
pants completed the cognitive subscale of the Pre-Sleep Arousal 
Scale [7] prior to sleep (following probe task completion on task 
completion days). Additionally, we assessed the time taken to fall 
asleep (sleep onset latency) and the frequency of waking both ob- 
jectively, with a wireless electrophysiological monitor [8] and sub- 
jectively via a sleep diary [9] . The latter also provided ratings of 
overall sleep quality (from 1 = very bad to 5 = very good). Finally, 
changes in insomnia-related anxiety between days 1 and 8 were 
assessed using the Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Ques- 
tionnaire (APSQ [10] ). 
Participants in the ABM and control groups did not differ sig- 

 
nificantly in gender (p > 0.10), age or any baseline measures, with 
the exception of sleep quality ( table 1 ). All daily measures were 
subjected to an ABM condition (ABM/control) by probe task day 
(1–5) mixed model ANOVA. Results revealed main effects of the 
ABM condition showing that, compared to those in the control

condition, subjects in the ABM condition reported significantly 
lower pre-sleep arousal (on the cognitive subscale of the Pre-Sleep 
Arousal Scale) and better overall sleep quality (a reversal of the 
baseline difference). Additionally, electrophysiological monitor 
measures showed that those in the ABM condition fell asleep fast- 
er and woke less often during the night compared to controls. No 
other significant main effects or interactions were observed (all 
F < 1.7, all p > 0.15; see table 1 for means and between-group dif- 
ferences). 
Changes in sleep-related anxiety (APSQ) were assessed via a 

 
condition (ABM/control) by assessment time (pre-/post-assess- 
ment) mixed model ANOVA, which showed a significant interac- 
tion effect, F(1, 34) = 5.44, p = 0.03, η 2 = 0.16. This interaction was 
carried by a significant decrease in APSQ scores from pre-assess- 
ment (mean = 61.61, SD = 18.00) to post-assessment time points 
(mean = 40.72, SD = 13.38) in the ABM group, t = 3.86, p < 0.01, 
d = 1.32, that did not approach significance for the pre-assessment 
(mean = 61.50, SD = 17.88) to the post- assessment time (mean = 
56.17, SD = 14.34) in the control group, t = 1.36, p = 0.19, d = 0.33. 
In summary, as compared to the control condition, participants 
who completed ABM training reported less pre-sleep arousal, fell 
asleep faster, woke less often during the night, reported a better 
overall sleep quality and showed significant reductions in sleep- 
related anxiety from before to after the 5-day programme. 
Although these effects are entirely consistent with the positive 

 
effects of ABM on relevant sleep measures, we did not also observe 
any significant change in attentional bias. While this may represent 
a genuine absence of bias change, the consistency of effects across 
separate sleep measures suggests that ABM was having the intend- 
ed effect. It is possible therefore that iPhone-based assessment cou- 
pled with the relatively small sample size may not have been suf- 
ficient to detect bias changes. Indeed, a post hoc power analysis 
suggests that in order to detect a medium-sized between-group 
effect in attentional bias it would be necessary to recruit a sample 
with more than 50 participants. 
Overall, these results suggest that attentional bias modification 

 
targeting vigilance for sleep-related threat during the pre-sleep pe- 
riod has the capacity to reduce cognitive arousal and improve in- 
somnia symptoms, providing a crucial step towards establishing a 
novel intervention for insomnia. Given the small sample size, rep- 
lication with a larger sample will be crucial before it is possible to 
draw firm conclusions about potential benefits of ABM for insom- 
nia. Nevertheless the results provide encouragement that targeted 
ABM could be used not only as a potential treatment for insomnia, 
but also with other conditions that implicate attentional bias (and 
consequent anxious arousal), as being acutely problematic at spe- 
cific points in time. These findings therefore not only highlight a 
novel target for ABM in insomnia, but also a novel method of ABM 
by targeting acute rather than enduring change in attentional bias.
