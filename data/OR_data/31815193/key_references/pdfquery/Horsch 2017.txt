Background: This study is one of the first randomized controlled trials investigating cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia 
(CBT-I) delivered by a fully automated mobile phone app. Such an app can potentially increase the accessibility of insomnia 
treatment for the 10% of people who have insomnia. 
Objective: The objective of our study was to investigate the efficacy of CBT-I delivered via the Sleepcare mobile phone app, 
compared with a waitlist control group, in a randomized controlled trial. 
Methods: We recruited participants in the Netherlands with relatively mild insomnia disorder. After answering an online pretest 
questionnaire, they were randomly assigned to the app (n=74) or the waitlist condition (n=77). The app packaged a sleep diary, 
a relaxation exercise, sleep restriction exercise, and sleep hygiene and education. The app was fully automated and adjusted itself 
to a participant’s progress. Program duration was 6 to 7 weeks, after which participants received posttest measurements and a 
3-month follow-up. The participants in the waitlist condition received the app after they completed the posttest questionnaire. 
The measurements consisted of questionnaires and 7-day online diaries. The questionnaires measured insomnia severity, 
dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and anxiety and depression symptoms. The diary measured sleep variables such as sleep 
efficiency. We performed multilevel analyses to study the interaction effects between time and condition. 
Results: The results showed significant interaction effects (P<.01) favoring the app condition on the primary outcome measures 
of insomnia severity (d=–0.66) and sleep efficiency (d=0.71). Overall, these improvements were also retained in a 3-month 
follow-up. 
Conclusions: This study demonstrated the efficacy of a fully automated mobile phone app in the treatment of relatively mild 
insomnia. The effects were in the range of what is found for Web-based treatment in general. This supports the applicability of 
such technical tools in the treatment of insomnia. Future work should examine the generalizability to a more diverse population. 
Furthermore, the separate components of such an app should be investigated. It remains to be seen how this app can best be 
integrated into the current health regimens.

Approximately 10% of the western adult population have 
chronic insomnia [1]. People with insomnia experience 
difficulties falling asleep, staying asleep, or both, and as a 
consequence they are sleep deprived during the day [2]. For 
example, 
levels of 
concentration, greater 
impaired cognitive 
functioning [3-5]. Another consequence of insomnia is an 
increased risk of developing mental disorders such as depression 
and anxiety [6,7], or physical disorders such as diabetes and 
high blood pressure [8,9]. Insomnia also leads to societal costs 
such as reduced productivity, higher levels of sick leave, and 
more accidents [10]. 
is associated with 
fatigue, and 

One of the most common nonpharmacological treatments for 
insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-I). CBT-I is an 
effective treatment in either a face-to-face [11-13] or a self-help 
format [14,15]. Recently it has become more common to offer 
these self-help formats via the Internet. A recent meta-analysis 
[16] demonstrated that Internet-delivered CBT-I showed large 
treatment effects (Cohen d=1.0) on the Insomnia Severity Index 
(ISI). In addition to the efficacy of computerized CBT-I 
(CCBT-I), this format has multiple other advantages over 
face-to-face treatments. Potentially it can save costs, because 
less therapist time is needed, and the treatment can be offered 
to a larger number of people who can go through the treatment 
in their own time. 
Until now, studies on computerized treatments have been mostly 
limited to Web-based treatments. A possible next step is 
delivering CCBT-I via a mobile phone app. CCBT-I delivered 
via a mobile phone has similar advantages to existing CCBT-I, 
such as wide and easy accessibility, reduced stigma, and greater 
cost-efficiency [17], but it could potentially exceed those 
advantages because mobile phones are portable. People carry 
their phones with them all the time and they are ubiquitous, 
unobtrusive, and intimate. Therefore, an effective app-based 
treatment for insomnia would increase the possible coverage 
for CBT-I. Furthermore, mobile phones are rich in sensors, 
computationally powerful, and remotely accessible, which 
provides opportunities 
ecological 
for personalization, 
momentary access, and real-time tracking [18,19]. 
In the domain of sleep, several kinds of sleep apps have been 
studied. For example, there is an app that unobtrusively increases 
awareness of sleep hygiene recommendations [20], an app that 
applies active sleep sampling for measuring sleep [21], a social 
app that shares time in bed based on alarm usage [22], and an 
app that supports and was used alongside of face-to-face CBT-I. 
To the best of our knowledge, however, no studies have 
evaluated the efficacy of stand-alone CCBT-I apps. To bridge 
this gap, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare 
a group using a CCBT-I-based app with a waitlist control group. 
We expected that this app would have an ameliorating effect 
on insomnia severity and sleep impairment compared with the 
waitlist control group, assessed by a sleep diary. 
The app offered a sleep diary, a relaxation exercise, sleep 
restriction exercise, and sleep hygiene and education. Since 
sleep restriction is seen as the most effective exercise [23,24], 
it was the main focus of the app. The goal was to demonstrate 
the app’s efficacy in a sample of patients with relatively mild 
insomnia in order to test the proof of principle before 
investigating it in a more severely affected population. 

This study had a between-participants design with 2 arms: a 
waitlist condition and an 
intervention condition, with 
preintervention, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up 
measures. 
Participants 
We recruited participants from August 15 to October 21, 2015, 
via websites, social media, online advertisements, flyers, and a 
press release in the Netherlands. An initial group of 639 
interested individuals completed an informed consent form and 
started the online questionnaire. Of this group, we excluded 269 
people based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Figure 
1; Multimedia Appendix 1 [25]). Inclusion criteria were (1) 
difficulty with initiating or maintaining sleep for at least 30 
minutes a night, for at least 3 nights a week, for at least 3 
months, causing clinically significant distress or impairment in 
daily functioning, in accordance with the criteria for a 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) 
diagnosis of insomnia [2], (2) stable medication use, (3) aged 
≥18 years, and (4) a valid email address, connected to the 
Internet, and in possession of an Android mobile phone 
(operating system version 4.1 or higher). Exclusion criteria were 
(1) ISI score [26] <7, (2) previous treatment with CBT-I (3) 
having started other psychotherapy in the last 6 months, (4) 
self-reported diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychosis, (5) alcohol 
or marijuana abuse (>3 glasses of alcohol a day for at least 21 
days a month, or use of marijuana more than once a week), (6) 
possible sleep apnea (determined with a subscale of the 
SLEEP-50 questionnaire; cut off ≥15 [27]), (7) shift work, (8) 
pregnant or breast-feeding, (9) symptoms of depression 
(determined with a subscale of the Centre for Epidemiological 
Studies Depression [CES-D] scale [28,29]; cutoff ≥27), or (10) 
total sleep time ≤5 hours on average as reported in a consecutive 
7-day sleep diary prior to the experiment. We measured all 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, except the last one, using an 
online questionnaire asking the participants directly about the 
criteria (see Multimedia Appendix 2).

Intervention 
The Sleepcare app [30,31] was based on previously published 
protocols (eg, [32,33]) and followed a talk-and-tool design 
principle, which is based on the idea that people interact 
symbolically and physically with their environment (see [34] 
for more details on the rationale and design decisions). The app 
packaged a sleep diary, a relaxation exercise, sleep restriction

(page number not for citation purposes) 


exercise, and sleep hygiene and education (Figure 2). The app 
offered these exercises in Dutch, adjusted them to the 
participant, and reminded participants to perform the exercises. 
The basic program duration was 6 to 7 weeks, depending on a 
participant’s adherence. For example, if a participant had filled 
out <6 sleep diaries since starting the app, the app explained to 
the participant that the sleep restriction exercise could start only 
after they had completed 6 diaries. If they had completed <6 
diaries, the introduction of the sleep restriction exercise was 
postponed until participants met this prerequisite. The app was 
fully automated and did not require any input from therapists 
or a human administrator. Automatic warnings were built in 
when participants slept for <5 hours on average. The first 

warning appeared after 5 days and warned against activities 
such as driving a car while feeling sleepy. Follow-up warnings 
also included a referral to the general practitioner, and the app 
automatically stopped the sleep restriction exercise. 
The app consisted of a home screen that displayed the scheduled 
exercises for that day. Furthermore, there was a menu, a 
calendar, and a conversation screen (Figure 3). The menu 
provided access to all components of the app and the CBT-I 
exercises. The calendar displayed all the scheduled activities 
for the whole 7 weeks, which the participants could browse 
through at any time. The app interacted with the participants 
via dialogues on the conversation screen.

Conversations 
The conversation screen (Figure 3) displayed the dialogues 
between the app and the participants, which were inspired by 
face-to-face consultations. New exercises were introduced, and 
the progress of the participants was evaluated. Typically, the 
app gave information and asked multiple-choice questions. 
Participants could open new conversations only after the 
previous conversation was finished. Conversations were initiated 
by the app based on a participant’s adherence and progress. For 
example, if a relaxation exercise was done <3 times within 4 
days of its introduction, a conversation would start to address 
the participant’s adherence. Additionally, the app started 
conversations based on a participant’s progress; for example, 
after the participant had filled out the sleep diary for a week, 
the app calculated and showed weekly sleep efficiency averages 
in an evaluation conversation. A detailed description of the 
underlying design principles can be found in Beun et al [34]. 


The sleep diary was a visual translation of the core Consensus 
Sleep Diary [35] consisting of 4 screens asking participants to 
fill in their bedtimes and wake times, and their subjective sleep 
quality. The sleep diary could only be filled out for the previous 
night. Connected to the sleep diary was the sleep overview, 
which gave a visual summary of the participant’s sleep.

Relaxation exercises have a long history for treating insomnia. 
Based on the idea that hyperarousal is a main determinant of 
insomnia, relaxation exercises are the designated treatment [36]. 
The relaxation exercise was a progressive muscle relaxation 
exercise of varying durations, ranging from 1 to 16 minutes. 
The participants could choose the length of the exercise 
themselves before starting the exercise. By being offered short 
exercises, participants were able to gradually develop the habit 
of relaxing. The participants were guided by a voice track, which 
told them which muscles to contract and when to relax. The app 
advised participants to do the relaxation exercise once a day, 
although participants could do the exercises as often as they 
wanted [37]. 

Sleep restriction is seen as the most effective exercise [23,24], 
and therefore was the main focus of the app. After a week, the 
app introduced the modified sleep restriction exercise, on 
condition that participants had filled ≥6 sleep diaries and had 
an average sleep efficiency of <85%. We developed an 
algorithm to calculate the ideal and maximum time in bed for 
that specific participant based on the average sleep times of the 
previous week (FGB, unpublished data, 2016). The algorithm 
used rules such as (1) the ideal time in bed is equal to the 
average time in bed, (2) the maximum time in bed is always at 
least 1 hour less than the average time in bed, (3) the advised 
time in bed is never <5 hours [38], and (4) the advised time in 
bed lies between average total sleep time and average time in 
bed. Participants had the opportunity to negotiate their sleep 
time. The app first suggested that the participant abide by the 
ideal time in bed. The participant was then given the option to 
accept that time in bed, to negotiate longer time in bed up to 
the calculated maximum time in bed, or to refrain from sleep 
restriction completely. Participants were allowed to negotiate 
about and refrain from the sleep restriction exercise in order to 
enhance self-empowerment, set realistic goals, and thereby 
increase adherence. Every week the app evaluated the adherence 
and effect of the sleep restriction exercise. When participants’ 
sleep efficiency was >85%, they were allowed 15 minutes extra 
in bed. When a participant’s average sleep efficiency was <85%, 
the app suggested the same or a further restriction of 15 minutes, 
depending on a participant’s adherence. We used a modified 
sleep restriction protocol because we assumed this would 
increase the possibility of completing the restriction exercise, 
on the basis that more lenient sleep restriction is better than no 
sleep restriction at all. 



Sleep hygiene

education 
recommendations and knowledge about sleep. As a 
single-component intervention, it lacks efficacy [13]. However, 
it lays the foundation for CBT-I, since it increases participants’ 
knowledge about sleep and the factors influencing sleep. By 
increasing understanding, sleep hygiene and education increase 
the efficacy of the other CBT-I exercises, and are therefore 
included in many multicomponent interventions [36]. Sleep 
hygiene and education information was presented on different 
screens as tips and facts in text format. The tips were divided 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
into 3 categories: (1) food and drink, (2) bedroom, and (3) 
behavior. “Use your bedroom only for sleeping, not for working” 
was an example of a bedroom tip. The sleep facts were 
categorized into 8 groups: (1) sleep cycles, (2) amount of sleep, 
(3) age, (4) animals, (5) disorders, (6) causes, (7) sleep medicine, 
and (8) fun facts. An example of a fact about age is “The amount 
of sleep a person needs is age dependent.” 
Persuasive Strategies 
We implemented various kinds of persuasive strategies to 
support the participants’ adherence. First, the app sent 
notifications for both the exercises and the conversations. So, 
for a scheduled exercise such as filling in the sleep diary, the 
app sent the participants a notification. For unfinished 
conversations, additional reminders were sent every day at noon. 
Second, the app provided room for negotiation about the sleep 
restriction assignment as described earlier. Furthermore, the 
app was designed to be easy to use and attractive, to improve 
adherence [31,39]. 



We measured the severity of insomnia with a Dutch translation 
of the widely used ISI. This is a 7-item questionnaire with scores 
ranging from 0 (no insomnia) to 28 (severe insomnia). A cutoff 
score of 7 determined relatively mild insomnia [26]. We set the 
cutoff score at this level instead of the clinically more relevant 
cutoff score of 10 [40] because the goal of this study was to 
demonstrate the feasibility of the app in a sample of patients 
with at least subclinical levels of insomnia. 

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rating scale 
that measures sleep disturbances over a 1-month period [41]. 
The PSQI consists of 19 items with scores from 0 to 3 evaluating 
7 subdomains. The scores of these subdomains are summed to 
calculate a global score ranging from 0 to 21. A global score 
>5 indicates severe impairment in at least two domains, or 
moderate impairment in at least three domains. 
We measured dysfunctional beliefs with the Dutch translation 
of the brief Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep 
(DBAS-16) scale [42]. The DBAS-16 consists of 16 statements 
with scores from 0 to 10 to indicate how much people agree 
with the statement. The average is calculated so that the total 
score ranges from 0 (no dysfunctional beliefs) to 10 (severe 
dysfunctional beliefs). 
Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the 7 anxiety items of 
the Dutch version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS) [43,44]. The summed score ranges from 0 (no 
symptoms of anxiety) to 21 (severe symptoms of anxiety). 
Depressive symptoms were measured using a Dutch translation 
of the CES-D scale. The CES-D consists of 20 items with scores 
ranging from 0 to 3, which are summed, with higher scores 
indicating more depressive symptoms [28,29].

Diary Measures 
We used an online Dutch translated version of the consensus 
sleep diary [35]. Participants filled out the sleep diary for 7 
days. In the diary they recorded the time they went to bed, the 
time they tried to go to sleep, their time of final awakening, 
their time out of bed, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, 
terminal wakefulness, number of awakenings, sleep quality (1 
= “very bad” to 10 = “very good”), and use of sleep medication. 
From these variables, we calculated the time in bed (time in 
bed=final arising time–time of going to bed), sleep time (total 
sleep time=time in bed–sleep onset latency–wake after sleep 
onset–terminal wakefulness), and sleep efficiency (sleep 
efficiency=[total sleep time/time in bed]×100). Sleep efficiency 
was the second primary measure in this trial. 
Process Measures 
We measured motivation to use the app with the Situational 
Motivation Scale [45] and acceptance of the app with the unified 
theory of acceptance and use of technology [46]. The focus of 
this paper is on the outcome measures, so we do not include the 
results of the process measures. 
Procedure 
Participants gave online informed consent and filled out the 
questionnaire addressing the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
demographic information, and the outcome measures. The 
participants who met the study criteria received a link to an 
online sleep diary by email for 7 successive days. Emails for 
the diary were sent at 6.00 AM, and a reminder email was sent 
at 10.00 AM. We excluded participants who reported an average 
total sleep time of <5 hours and then randomly assigned the 
others to either the app or the waitlist condition. Randomization 
was carried out by a third party who was not part of this study. 
They used an online tool [47] to generate blocks of 20 
participants. The list of the randomization sequence was kept 
in a locked office cupboard by the third party. After participants 
were assigned to a condition, participants and the principal 
investigator (CH) were no longer blinded to the condition 
allocation. 
Then, 3 weeks after starting with the app or the waitlist 
condition, all participants received an interim measurement 
consisting of the ISI and DBAS-16, supplemented with questions 
regarding motivation (Situational Motivation Scale) and app 
acceptance for the app group. These interim measures are not 
reported in this paper. Both groups received a postintervention 
questionnaire, 7 weeks after random assignment, consisting of 
all the outcome measures (ISI, PSQI, DBAS-16, CES-D, and 
HADS) and a 7-day diary. In addition, participants in the app 
group received questions regarding the effect and utility of the 
app, which are not reported in this paper. After completing the 
diary, participants in the waitlist condition received the app. 
Participants in the app condition additionally received a 3-month 
follow-up questionnaire and diary. 
The study was approved by the internal Ethical Review Board 
of the University of Amsterdam, and was registered with the 
Netherlands Trial Register (NTR5560).

Required Statistical Power 
To our knowledge, this study is the first large-scale randomized 
controlled trial to study an app to treat chronic insomnia, so 
expected effects were unknown. Earlier research about 
Web-based CBT-I found a Cohen d>1.0 [48,49]. We were 
uncertain whether these large effects could also be obtained by 
an app, so we anticipated an average effect. A power calculation 
for a mixed analysis of variance design (effect: f2=0.15, power 
80%, alpha=.05) indicated that a total of 90 participants were 
needed to detect a potential difference between the 2 conditions. 
As a meta-analysis showed that on average 50% of people 
adhere to technology-mediated insomnia treatment [50], the 
goal was set to include 180 participants. 
Analyses 
We tested the effects of the intervention using multilevel 
analyses, which allows for the inclusion of participants with 1 
measurement and therefore is appropriate for intention-to-treat 
analyses [51]. Models were built in R version 3.1.3 (The R 
Foundation) to explore within-group (time), between-group 
(condition: app vs waitlist), and interaction (time × condition) 
effects. Model 0 is the basic model and includes only the 
participants as a random intercept. Model 1 adds the fixed factor 
time to model 0. Model 2 was built on model 1 and adds the 
condition as a fixed effect. Finally, model 3 adds the interaction 
effect between time and condition. Models 4 and 5 concern the 
premeasurement and follow-up data. Model 4 is the null model 
that includes only the participants as a random intercept. In 
model 5 time is added. Since there were no follow-up 
measurements for the waitlist, condition is not included. Dropout 
analyses for the postmeasurements showed that age, sleep 
quality, and terminal wakefulness were associated with 
nonresponse in the app condition. In the waitlist condition, 
number of awakenings was related to nonresponse. Dropout 
analyses for the follow-up measurements showed that terminal 
wakefulness was associated with nonresponse. Therefore, they 
were added as covariates in all models in the multilevel 
regression analyses [51]. We calculated chi-squares for the 
various models to compare the ability of the models to fit the 
data. Furthermore, we calculated R2 values to indicate the level 
of variance explained by the level-1 variables [52]. R2 values 
of .10 indicate a small effect, R2=.30 indicates a medium effect, 
and R2=.50 indicates a large effect [53]. 
To enhance comparability with other studies, we calculated 
between-group Cohen d values. Table 1 shows the means and 
effect sizes based on an imputed dataset. First, we used multiple 
imputation in IBM SPSS version 22 (IBM Corporation) to insert 
missing cases [54]. Data from 41-44 participants (27.2%-29.1%) 
were missing for the outcome questionnaires. Diaries were 
missing from 76 of the 151 participants (50.3%). The follow-up 
measurements were not imputed due to a large amount of 
missing data. For imputation, we used the pre- and post 
measures of the ISI, PSQI, DBAS-16, CES-D, HADS, sleep 
quality, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, number of 
awakenings, time in bed, terminal wakefulness, total sleep time, 
and sleep efficiency, next to sex and age. With a predictive 
J Med Internet Res 2017 | vol. 19 | iss. 4 | e70 | p. 7 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


mean matching procedure, 10 separate datasets were generated. 
The values in Table 1 are based on these imputed datasets. 
Second, we calculated Cohen d values by dividing the difference 
in change scores by the pooled standard deviation of that change 
score (d=[meanchange score waitlist–meanchange score app]/SDpooled), 
whereby meanchange score=meanpre–meanpost. We calculated 
within-group Cohen d values using the pre- and post scores per 




deviation 
condition 
(d=[meanpre–meanpost]/SDpooled). Additionally, we calculated 
within-group Cohen d values with the pre- and follow-up scores 
per 
standard deviation 
the pooled 
(d=[meanpre–meanfollow-up]/SDpooled) (Table 2). A Cohen d of 
0.20 indicates a small effect, 0.50 a moderate effect, and 0.80 
a large effect [53].

Baseline Characteristics of the Sample 
We randomly assigned 151 participants to the app (n=74) or a 
waitlist condition (n=79). Participants had a mean age of 39.66 
years (SD 13.44; range 18-80). Of the total 151 participants, 94 
were female (62.3%). Table 3 shows demographic information 
about the participants, as well as the randomization check. At 
baseline, the groups did not differ significantly on any 
demographic characteristics (all P values >.05). 
Efficacy: Intention-to-Treat Analyses 
Table 1 displays the mean scores for all the outcome measures 
and corresponding Cohen d values for the baseline and 
postmeasurements. Table 2 displays the mean scores for the 
follow-up measures. Figure 4 depicts the scores for the main 
outcome measures ISI and sleep efficiency. Table 4 and Table 



5 present the results of the multilevel analyses. Table 4 shows 
the coefficients for model 3 and their standard errors, and 
whether the coefficients were significant. Table 5 shows whether 
there was a significant difference between the models (χ2) and 
the level of variance explained (R2). The multilevel analyses 
showed significant interaction effects between time and 
condition on the primary outcome measures ISI (d=–0.66) and 
sleep efficiency (d=0.71) at posttest. These effects indicate that 
the app was more effective than the waitlist condition. 
Furthermore, wake after sleep onset, number of awakenings, 
PSQI, CES-D, and HADS improved and showed significant 
interaction effects (Table 4 and Table 5), but sleep onset latency, 
time in bed, terminal wakefulness, total sleep time, and 
DBAS-16 showed no significant effects at posttest. At 
follow-up, improvements on all outcome measures remained 
significant, except for number of awakenings.

Among the participants who completed the pre- and posttest, 
we found a clinically meaningful change on the ISI (∆ISI≥8) 
[40] between the waitlist and the app conditions. We also 
observed a significant clinically meaningful change 20 times 
in the app condition (20/45, 44%) and 7 times in the waitlist 
condition (7/62, 11%) at the posttest. In the app condition, 
significantly more people reached a meaningful clinical change 
(χ2 
1=15.19, P<.001). Before treatment, all participants had an 

































ISI score >7 [26]. Of the participants who completed the 
posttest, 17 in the app condition (17/45, 38%) and 6 in the 
waitlist condition (6/62, 10%) had an ISI score ≤7. In the app 
condition, significantly more participants dropped below the 
insomnia threshold of ISI ≤7 than in the waitlist condition 
(χ2 
1=12.20, P<.001). At follow-up, 7 of the 29 participants had 
an ISI score ≤7 (7/29, 24%).

Treatment Adherence 
We divided treatment adherence into 4 components objectively 
measured by the app: (1) the number of sleep diaries filled out, 
(2) the number of relaxation exercises performed, (3) the number 
of conversations completed, and (4) the deviation between real 
time in bed and agreed-upon time in bed (Table 6). Only 2 of 
the 74 participants did not download the app. Furthermore, the 
adherence data showed different adherence patterns (see 
Multimedia Appendix 3). Most participants (n=35) filled out 
>35 diaries, 13 participants filled out <7 diaries, and the other 
24 participants filled out between 7 and 35 diaries. This pattern 
follows a U-shaped curve. For the relaxation exercise, another 
pattern can be distinguished. More than half of the participants 
(n=41) performed a maximum of 7 relaxation exercises, of 
whom 11 participants did not do any relaxation exercises at all; 
7 participants did >35 relaxation exercises. For the conversations 
the opposite was true: most participants (n=47) finished ≥90% 
of the conversations. Only a few participants (n=4) finished 
<10% of the conversations. A total of 38 participants started 
and committed to the sleep restriction exercise, meaning that 
they came to an agreement with the coach about their time in 
bed. Participants could stay in bed for longer or for less time 
than the agreement, and both situations occurred. Of these 38 
participants, 32 stayed in bed for longer than agreed on for most 
of the nights involving sleep restriction. When participants 
stayed in bed too long it was by 67 minutes on average (SD 45); 
when they shortened their time in bed it was by 42 minutes on 
average (SD 29). Of the 38 participants, 26 (68%) were adherent, 
meaning that their time in bed deviated by an average of <60 
minutes from the agreed-upon time in bed.

In this large-scale randomized controlled trial, we investigated 
the efficacy of CBT-I delivered via a mobile phone app. The 
results show that the app had moderate significant effects than 
in a waitlist on the primary measures of insomnia severity 
(d=–0.66, 95% CI –0.99 to –0.33) and sleep efficiency (d=0.71, 
95% CI 0.37-1.04). The following secondary measures also 
improved compared with the waitlist: wake after sleep onset, 
number of awakenings, PSQI, depression, and anxiety. Other 
measures, such as time in bed, total sleep time, and dysfunctional 
beliefs about sleep did not show significant improvements, 
which could be explained by the exercises included in the 
treatment. The focus on modified sleep restriction in the app 
could explain the lack of improvement in time in bed and total 
sleep time, since sleep restriction aims at increasing sleep 
efficiency, starting by decreasing time in bed and thereby also 
influencing total sleep time. In addition, the app did not contain 
a cognitive exercise, which could explain why we found no 
difference in the dysfunctional beliefs about sleep. Nevertheless, 
at posttest, 44% of the participants in the app condition had 
achieved a clinically meaningful change compared with 11% 
in the waitlist condition. The improvements were largely 
sustained at the 3-month follow-up. The observed effects on 
the primary measures are similar to those reported in a recent 
meta-analysis on sleep efficiency (Hedge g=0.58) and somewhat 
lower (but in the same range) than those reported for insomnia 
severity (Hedge g=1.09) [16]. Note that the meta-analysis was 
based on studies with various levels of human involvement, 
ranging from no human support to personal contact as part of 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
the intervention. Earlier research indicated that human support 
increases efficacy [55]. However, the effect sizes in our study 
were achieved without any form of human support. 
Regarding automated support, this study most closely resembles 
the trials by Espie and colleagues [48] and Ritterband and 
colleagues [56], which both offered automated Web-based 
CBT-I. These Web-based treatments packaged the full scope 
of CBT-I and demonstrated large effects. Espie and colleagues 
found a Cohen d of 0.95 for sleep efficiency. Ritterband and 
colleagues found a Cohen d of 1.26 for insomnia severity and 
0.68 for sleep efficiency. Again, the observed effect sizes in our 
study were more or less in the same range as these published 
results, and our effects were achieved without including the full 
CBT-I package (eg, we did not include cognitive therapy and 
stimulus control). The app concentrated on sleep restriction, 
and as a result the effects for sleep efficiency are more 
pronounced than those for insomnia severity. The focus on sleep 
restriction may also explain the absence of an effect on total 
sleep time. 
Zachariae and colleagues [16] found in their meta-analysis that 
58.7% to 100% of the participants in the CCBT-I conditions 
completed postintervention assessments, with an average of 
75.3%. In our study, 61% of the participants in the app condition 
completed postintervention assessment questionnaires, while 
81% of the participants in the waitlist condition did so. This 
difference can probably be explained by the fact that the 
participants in the waitlist received the app only after they had 
filled out the postintervention assessment. However, the number 
of participants filling out assessments may not necessarily 
correspond to the number of participants who complete

(page number not for citation purposes) 


interventions. Therefore, we also report treatment adherence 
numbers and adequate doses. Previously, Espie and colleagues 
[48] found that 88% of their participants received an adequate 
dose (≥4 sessions). Lancee and colleagues [55] found that 83% 
received an adequate dose of the modules in the support 
condition, and 60% in the no-support condition. In our trial, 
adherence was measured for the different components, with 
adherence rates ranging from 10% to 68%. Apart from the 
relaxation exercise adherence (where only 10% of the 
participants received an adequate dose), the other adherence 
rates are comparable with the 60% found by Lancee and 
colleagues [55] in their no-support condition. 
In general, there exists a positive relationship between treatment 
adherence and treatment outcome [50]. This relationship 
suggests that this trial could have been more successful if 
relaxation adherence rates would have been higher, for example. 
Relaxation exercises have been noted as an effective treatment 
as part of multicomponent treatment [36]. Therefore, it is likely 
that higher adherence rates to the relaxation exercise would 
have improved the overall efficacy of the app. However, 
relaxation exercises as stand-alone treatment were inferior to 
other CBT-I exercises, such as stimulus control and sleep 
restriction [12]. So, as in all multicomponent treatments, it 
remains unclear how adherence to specific components affected 
the overall efficacy of the app. In this trial, overall adherence 
rates were adequate, but there was also a considerable number 
of people who did not start the modified sleep restriction 
exercise at all. Beforehand, we decided that it was better to keep 
people in no or a suboptimal sleep restricting schedule rather 
than letting them drop out of the treatment altogether. A possible 
risk of suboptimal treatments could be that people may not seek 
further help after a less-successful treatment. However, this is 
a general health care risk, which is not typical for eHealth or 
self-help interventions. Nevertheless, the optimal tradeoff 
between individual autonomy and strictness in mobile phone 
app regimens has yet to be determined in future studies. 
Limitations and Future Work 
This study has a number of limitations that should be considered 
in relation to the findings. Since the goal of the study was to 
demonstrate the efficacy of the app first in a group with 
insomnia disorder but without too much sleep impairment, we 
used an ISI score of >7, meaning that we excluded people who 
slept <5 hours as measured by a sleep diary. This exclusion 
criterion may have led to a floor effect and the inclusion of 
participants with relatively little room for improvement. 
Although it is hard to compare studies because of different 
inclusion criteria, it seems that Espie and colleagues [48] only 
included participants with more severe insomnia (baseline sleep 
efficiency of 55%–65%). It may be possible to achieve larger 
effects in samples with higher levels of symptoms. However, 
it remains the case that the efficacy of our mobile phone app 
has not yet been demonstrated in a sample with severe insomnia. 
Because this was one of the first times a stand-alone app has 
been used to deliver CBT-I, we also excluded participants with 
comorbidities such as depression. This and the issues mentioned 
above limit the generalizability of our results, especially given 
the high comorbidity of depression and insomnia. Now that the 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
app has proven its efficacy in a relatively mildly affected sample, 
future research could expand the inclusion criteria (eg, severe 
insomnia, depression) to study the efficacy of a CBT-I app in 
a more severely affected population. 
A methodological limitation was that no other Web-based or 
face-to-face treatment group was included. Several other studies 
have already demonstrated the efficacy of CCBT-I and CBT-I 
programs. However, a similar Web-based condition could 
provide insight into the added value of a mobile app. Another 
related limitation is that there was no placebo control group. It 
may very well be that nonspecific factors played a role in the 
treatment effects of the app. Other methodological limitations 
this study used self-report measures, and 
were 
polysomnography would be needed to confirm the objective 
changes in sleep. Furthermore, the participants in this study 
were a self-selected sample and may have been an unusual group 
of people who were interested in solving their sleep difficulties 
with self-help. A high percentage of the sample consisted of 
university-educated participants, who represent only a part of 
society. 

Another limitation was that the app focused on sleep restriction 
and relaxation. Future work should include more of the other 
CBT-I components, such as cognitive exercises, and evaluate 
those. Mobile phone apps provide us with the unique opportunity 
to study the separate components of CBT-I in a controlled way. 
Future research could focus on studying the separate 
components, so that more insight can be gained into the 
individual efficacy of these CBT-I components. In addition, 
future research should compare the efficacy of the classical 
sleep restriction versus the modified sleep restriction exercise. 
Lastly, there were some technical issues during the randomized 
controlled trial that made it impossible for some participants to 
continue to the next conversation. The occurrence of this 
problem was monitored and solved when needed. In these cases, 
a new conversation was manually planned in the database for 
a specific participant, and an email with instructions to update 
the app was sent to that participant. 
Conclusion 
We are confident that this study has produced insights into the 
domain of automated e-coaching apps for insomnia. These apps 
provide an opportunity to investigate separate treatment 
components while minimizing the influence of nonspecific 
therapist factors such as therapeutic alliance. Keeping the 
limitations in mind, this study demonstrated the efficacy of a 
mobile phone app in the treatment of insomnia. These effects 
were clinically meaningful and in the range of what is found 
for Web-based treatment in general. This supports the 
applicability of these kinds of technical tools in the treatment 
of insomnia. Through these apps, many more people can be 
offered effective insomnia treatment with probable reduced 
costs. We are confident that mobile phone apps will prove to 
be useful in the realm of prevention treatments; it remains to 
be determined how they should best be offered: in a stand-alone 
format for (prevention) treatment, or within a blended care 
framework where the sleep specialist uses an app to improve 
and accelerate insomnia treatment.
