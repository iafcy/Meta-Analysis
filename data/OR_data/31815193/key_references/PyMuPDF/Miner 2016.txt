Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major public health concern. Although effective
treatments exist, affected individuals face many barriers to receiving traditional care. Smartphones are
carried by nearly 2 thirds of the U.S. population, offering a promising new option to overcome many of
these barriers by delivering self-help interventions through applications (apps). As there is limited
research on apps for trauma survivors with PTSD symptoms, we conducted a pilot feasibility, accept-
ability, and potential efficacy trial of PTSD Coach, a self-management smartphone app for PTSD.
Method: A community sample of trauma survivors with PTSD symptoms (N  49) were randomized to
1 month using PTSD Coach or a waitlist condition. Self-report assessments were completed at baseline,
postcondition, and 1-month follow-up. Following the postcondition assessment, waitlist participants were
crossed-over to receive PTSD Coach. Results: Participants reported using the app several times per week,
throughout the day across multiple contexts, and endorsed few barriers to use. Participants also reported
that PTSD Coach components were moderately helpful and that they had learned tools and skills from the
app to manage their symptoms. Between conditions effect size estimates were modest (d  0.25
to 0.33) for PTSD symptom improvement, but not statistically significant. Conclusions: Findings
suggest that PTSD Coach is a feasible and acceptable intervention. Findings regarding efficacy are less
clear as the study suffered from low statistical power; however, effect size estimates, patterns of within
group findings, and secondary analyses suggest that further development and research on PTSD Coach
is warranted.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a potentially disabling
mental health condition that causes long term problems for indi-
viduals, families, and society in terms of compromised emotional
well-being, interpersonal challenges, productivity loss, and cost of
treatment (Kessler, 2000). PTSD is estimated to affect about 7% of
the U.S. population (Kessler et al., 2005). In addition, subthreshold
or partial PTSD—defined as having significant PTSD symptoms
without meeting diagnostic criteria—affects about 10% of trauma
survivors, a quarter of whom maintain or experience symptom
worsening over time (Cukor, Wyka, Jayasinghe, & Difede, 2010).
Thus, PTSD and partial PTSD represent considerable public health
concerns.

Evidence-based treatments are available for PTSD (Foa, Keane,
Friedman, & Cohen, 2009), but many affected individuals go
untreated (Kessler, 2000). Barriers to receiving treatment include
logistical issues, privacy and stigma-related concerns, insufficient
motivation, negative beliefs about the effectiveness of treatment,
and a desire to resolve symptoms on one’s own (Hoge et al., 2004;
Shalev, Ankri, Peleg, Israeli-Shalev, & Freedman, 2011). Addi-
tionally, in many areas there is a shortage of qualified mental
health care providers for individuals in need of care (Kazdin &
Rabbitt, 2013).
Technology, including mobile device applications (or apps),
offers a possible solution to help expand access to mental health
services (Free et al., 2013). For example, mobile apps can facilitate
access to high-quality psychoeducational information and self-
management tools independent of professional involvement, allow
for real-time in vivo interventions, and may reduce provider time
and overcome geographical limitations (Mohr, Burns, Schueller,
Clarke, & Klinkman, 2013). Mobile apps are also readily scalable
as smartphone ownership continues to rise, with nearly two thirds
(64%) of American adults currently owning smartphones, with a
majority of them (62%) using their smartphone to obtain health
information (Pew Research Center, 2015). Moreover, this technol-
ogy may be a viable means of reaching minority populations who
experience disparities in access to health care (López, Barrio,
Kopelowicz, & Vega, 2012; U.S. Department of Health & Human
Services, 2001), as rates of mobile phone usage in the U.S. are
higher for some ethnic minorities, including Hispanics and African
Americans, than for Whites (Pew Research Center, 2015).
Given the potential of this technology to help address the unmet
need for PTSD care, the PTSD Coach mobile app (Hoffman et al.,
2011) was developed by the Veterans Affairs’ (VA) National
Center for PTSD in partnership with the Department of Defense
National Center for Telehealth and Technology. It was designed by
PTSD experts and clinicians to offer trauma survivors high quality
psychoeducation about trauma and PTSD, sound PTSD symptom
assessment and monitoring (PTSD Checklist [PCL]; Weathers, Litz,
Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993), evidence-informed cognitive–
behavioral therapy (CBT)-based self-management tools, and easy
access to crisis support. It is available for free for both iOS (Apple)
and Android mobile devices, and since its release in April of 2011
it has been downloaded more than 200,000 times in 92 countries
(as of July 1, 2015). In a preliminary study, veterans being treated
for PTSD reported high satisfaction with PTSD Coach and re-
ported that it was helpful for managing their PTSD symptoms
(Kuhn et al., 2014).
Although Web-based interventions for PTSD have shown prom-
ise at reducing PTSD symptoms (Amstadter, Broman-Fulks, Zin-
zow, Ruggiero, & Cercone, 2009; Spence et al., 2011) and emerg-
ing
evidence
suggests
that
smartphone
apps
can
improve
depression and anxiety symptoms (Donker et al., 2013), there are
no controlled studies to our awareness that have evaluated the
effect of a mobile app on PTSD symptoms nor have there been
studies assessing the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile app
for self-management of PTSD symptoms with a community sam-
ple of trauma survivors. Therefore, the primary aims of the current
study were to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and potential
efficacy of PTSD Coach in reducing PTSD symptom severity in a
small-scale, randomized pilot study. Feasibility was assessed by
how much PTSD Coach was used, when and where it was used,
and barriers to its use. Acceptability was evaluated in terms of
whether participants found it useful and what in particular they
found helpful about it. Potential efficacy was assessed by evalu-
ating changes in self-reported PTSD symptoms after one month of
use in terms of both statistically significant changes as well as
effect size estimates to inform future development and research.
Lastly, we also explored whether baseline PTSD symptom severity
related to how much the app was used and whether symptom
improvement related to use.
Method
Participants
Eligibility criteria included being at least 18 years old, fluency
in English, not currently receiving treatment for PTSD, having an
active e-mail address, and scoring  25 on the PCL-C. This liberal
cut score was used to allow inclusion of trauma survivors who may
have had partial PTSD. However, despite such an inclusive cut
score, no participant had a PCL score lower than the recommended
range (i.e., 30–35) for PTSD screening in general population
(National Center for PTSD, 2015). As the primary aims of the
study were to assess feasibility, acceptability, and explore potential
efficacy (i.e., obtain an estimate of a between group effect size) to
inform a larger-scale trial, a power analysis was not conducted a
priori.
Measures
Demographics.
A series of items gathered information re-
garding age, gender, ethnicity, education, and smartphone owner-
ship.
Feasibility of PTSD Coach.
Participants reported PTSD
Coach use with the following question: On average, how often
each week did you open the app? using a 5-point scale ranging
from 1 (0 times) to 5 (10 or more times). Similar questions
assessed use of the psychoeducational (Learn) and the self-
management tools (Manage Symptoms) sections of the app. Par-
ticipants were also asked how many assessments (i.e., PCLs) they
completed (0–4), typical times and places/situation they used the
app, and barriers to app use, including limited time, difficulty
using, not getting much from the app, and not being able to find
what they needed on a 4-point scale: 0 (not a barrier) to 3 (extreme
barrier). Finally, participants reported if they personalized the app
with their own music, photos, or personal contacts (yes/no).
Acceptability of PTSD Coach.
Participants rated how helpful
the information was in both the Learn and Manage Symptoms
sections of the app on a 5-point scale (1  not at all, 2  slightly,
3  moderately, 4  very, 5  extremely). They were also asked
whether they could use skills from PTSD Coach to manage emo-
tions (1  strongly disagree to 5  strongly agree) and had
learned new tools from the app that were useful (yes/no). Partici-
pants rated how convenient using the app to get information was
relative to paper-based materials using a 5-point scale (1  not at
all to 5  extremely). Finally, an open-ended question inquired
about how the app was most useful to them. Responses to this
question were qualitatively categorized based on specific themes
associated with use of the app (e.g., for self-management of
symptoms, psychoeducation).

PTSD COACH APP FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY

PTSD.
The PTSD Checklist – Civilian (PCL-C; Weathers et
al., 1993) is a widely used 17-item self-report measure of PTSD
that has strong psychometric properties (Wilkins, Lang, & Nor-
man, 2011) and has shown measurement equivalence between
paper-and-pencil and web-based administrations (Read, Farrow,
Jaanimagi, & Ouimette, 2009). PCL items correspond to Diagnos-
tic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition
(DSM–IV) PTSD symptoms and are rated on how much the symp-
tom bothered the respondent in the past month on a scale ranging
from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). Total scores can range from 17
to 85. Cronbach’s alpha for the PCL administered at baseline was
.84, demonstrating adequate internal consistency.
Intervention
PTSD Coach provides evidence-supported tools, assessments,
and psychoeducation about PTSD symptoms and was designed to
be applicable across a broad range of trauma types (Kuhn et al.,
2014). The app does not deliver a structured program of use;
instead it allows users to determine how they wish to use the app.
It has four main goals that correspond with the major sections of
the app found on the home screen. The “Learn” section provides
psychoeducational information about trauma, PTSD, and profes-
sional treatment options. The “Manage Symptoms” section offers
CBT-based self-management tools for common PTSD-related
symptoms (e.g., interactive relaxation tools, stress inoculation
training, and grounding). The “Self Assessment” section allows
users to take, schedule, and view assessments of their PTSD
symptoms using the PCL-C (Weathers et al., 1993). The “Find
Support” section allows users to conveniently contact personal
contacts and crisis (e.g., national suicide prevention hotline) and
emergency services (911). Users can personalize the app by se-
lecting their own music, photos, and contacts stored on their
smartphone to be used in tools in the app (e.g., soothing pictures
or audio).
Procedure
Study procedures were approved by Stanford University’s In-
stitutional Review Board. All participants provided signed in-
formed consent. Enrollment began March 1, 2012 and data col-
lection ended September 30, 2013. Participants were recruited
using fliers posted throughout the San Francisco Bay Area as well
as through websites (i.e., med.stanford.edu/clinicaltrials, Craig-
slist.com) seeking volunteers who had experienced trauma, had
PTSD symptoms from it, and were willing to use a mobile app.
Interested individuals were screened for eligibility via an online
questionnaire or by phone. Eligible individuals were scheduled for
the baseline assessment during which they provided informed
consent and completed the assessment. After completing the base-
line measures, participants were randomly assigned with an equal
chance to either the PTSD Coach or waitlist condition. All self-
report assessments were completed online using a Web-based
survey tool (Qualtrics). Those assigned to the PTSD Coach con-
dition were given the app and instructed to use it however they
would like for the following month. No specific training, instruc-
tions for use, or suggestions of how PTSD Coach might be helpful
were provided in attempt to represent real world use. If the
participant did not have an Android or iOS compatible smartphone
or mobile device, an iPod Touch (model A1367, iOS 4.3) was
loaned to them (n  10) for the month. Those assigned to the
waitlist condition received no intervention over the ensuing month.
Participants completed the postcondition assessment one month
later. Upon completion of the postcondition assessment, partic-
ipants in the waitlist condition were given PTSD Coach (and
loaned an iPod Touch if necessary [n  7]) to use for the
following month. Those in the PTSD Coach condition received
no further instructions on app use. One month later, participants
in both conditions completed the follow-up assessment and
received $50 in major retail store gift cards for completing the
three assessments (i.e., baseline, postcondition, and 1-month
follow-up).
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were conducted using PASW Statistics version 21.
Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviation, num-
bers, and percentages, were used to summarize feasibility and
acceptability variables. Between groups repeated measures ANOVAs
were conducted to evaluate the potential efficacy of PTSD Coach.
The condition (PTSD Coach vs. waitlist) by time (baseline and
postcondition) interaction was used to estimate an effect size and
assess if there was significant differential change in PCL scores
using intention-to-treat (ITT) and completer analyses. For the ITT
analysis multiple imputation with 10 imputed data sets was used to
replace missing PCL values at the postcondition (n  5; 10.2%)
and follow-up (n  9; 18.4%) assessments and ranges and aver-
ages of statistics across these imputed datasets are presented.
Cohen’s ds were calculated for the between-condition effect size
(ES) using the following formula: ((PTSD Coach postcondition
M – baseline M) – (waitlist control postcondition M – baseline
M))/SD of the pooled change scores. A paired sample t test
evaluated mean changes from the postcondition to the 1-month
follow-up assessment for the waitlist control condition after being
crossed-over to receive PTSD Coach. A Cohen’s d for the within
Condition ES change was calculated by subtracting the postcon-
dition M from the 1-month follow-up M and dividing by the SD of
postcondition M. Three exploratory follow-up paired sample t tests
were conducted to evaluate within condition changes in mean PCL
scores for the PTSD Coach condition (baseline to postcondition,
baseline to 1-month follow-up) and waitlist condition (baseline to
postcondition). Cohen’s ds for these within Condition ES changes
were calculated by subtracting the baseline M from the postcon-
dition M and dividing by the SD of that condition’s baseline M.
This formula was also used for change from baseline to follow-up.
A 10-point decrease in PCL score is considered clinically signif-
icant (Monson et al., 2008). A chi-square test evaluated whether
there was a significant difference in the proportion of participants
achieving this level of change across conditions. To examine
whether baseline characteristics (i.e., gender, ethnicity, education,
and smartphone ownership) and PTSD symptom severity related to
improvements in PTSD symptoms in the PTSD Coach condition
from baseline to the postcondition assessment, we used indepen-
dent samples t tests. Finally, to assess whether baseline PTSD
symptoms and change in symptoms related to app use, Pearson
correlations were conducted.

Results
A total of 49 adults (40 women, 9 men) met eligibility criteria
and consented to participate and completed the baseline assess-
ment. Participants were an average of 45.7 years old (SD  13.9),
more than half identified as being White (55.1%, n  27), and
most had at least attended some college (77.6%, n  38). Table 1
provides other demographic characteristics of the full sample and
both study conditions.
There were no significant differences between the PTSD Coach
and waitlist conditions on gender, 2(1, N  49)  .191, p  .662,
age, t(47)  1.412, p  .164, ethnicity (White vs. other; 2(1, N 
42)  0.000, p  1.000), education (less than college degree vs.
college degree or higher; 2(1, N  42)  2.97, p  .085),
smartphone ownership, 2(1, N  48)  .022, p  1.000, and
baseline PCL scores, t(47)  1.134, p  .262. Participants who
dropped out at the postcondition assessment (n  5) did not
significantly differ, t(47)  .663, p  .511 in terms of baseline
mean PCL scores (58.00; SD  14.40) compared with completers
(61.57; SD  11.09). Figure 1 presents a flowchart of participants
through the study.
Feasibility
Participants in the PTSD Coach condition reported mean
weekly usage of 2.65 (SD  1.03) (i.e., falling between 1–3
times and 4–6 times) between the baseline and postcondition
assessments with no participant reporting not having used it at
all. The waitlist condition (when assigned to use the app)
reported a similar amount of weekly use (M  2.50; SD  0.83)
between the postcondition and follow-up assessments, and 1
participant reported he or she had not used it at all. The two
major intervention sections of the app (i.e., Learn and Manage
Symptoms), showed similar levels of use. Table 2 presents
descriptive statistics for the entire list of feasibility variables
based on study condition.
Acceptability
Table 3 presents the acceptability variables based on study
condition. To summarize, participants in both conditions endorsed
that the Learn and Manage Symptoms sections of the app were
“moderately helpful.” Participants also agreed that they could use
skills from PTSD Coach to manage emotions, and nearly 83% of
those in the PTSD Coach condition reported that they had learned
new tools to cope with their PTSD symptoms. Participants also
rated that getting information from the app was moderately to very
convenient relative to getting such information from paper mate-
rials. Finally, responses to the open-ended question about how the
app was most useful to them (n  38) showed that about half of the
app users reported that the self-management of symptoms was
most useful, whereas 5 (13.2%) participants reported that the app
was not useful to them.
Potential Efficacy
For the ITT sample, the condition by time interaction effect size
from the baseline to the postcondition assessment was modest for
both the ITT (average d  0.25) and completer (d  0.33)
analyses from the between groups repeated measures ANOVAs,
and neither was statistically significant (range of F(1, 47)  0.218
to 1.56, p  .218 to .597, F(1, 42)  1.22, p  .276, respectively;
see Table 4). Across both the ITT and completer samples, the
exploratory paired sample t tests showed that the PTSD Coach
condition had a statistically significant improvement on the PCL
between the baseline and the postcondition assessments (ITT:
t(24)  2.06, p  .040, d  0.59; completers: t(22)  2.35,
p  .028, d  0.78), whereas the waitlist condition did not (ITT:
t(23)  1.70, p  .093, d  0.31; completers: t(20)  1.81,
p  .086, d  0.29). PTSD Coach participants showed a sig-
nificant and large effect in PTSD symptom reduction from base-
line to the follow-up assessment (ITT: t(24)  2.89, p  .004,
d  0.97; completers: t(19)  2.31, p  .031, d  1.06).
Paired sample t tests evaluating within Condition PCL mean
change from the postcondition assessment to the follow-up assess-
ment showed that the waitlist condition (which was assigned to use
PTSD Coach) also evidenced a statistically significant decrease
(ITT: t(23)  2.80, p  .006, d  0.61; completers:
t(18)  2.92, p  .009, d  0.68).
Regarding clinically significant change on the PCL (i.e.,  10
point decrease; Monson et al., 2008), for completers, 9 participants
(39.1%) in the PTSD Coach condition had this amount of improve-
ment from the baseline to the postcondition assessment, whereas 4
participants (19.0%) in the waitlist condition had this degree of
improvement, which was not significantly different, 2(1, N 
44)  2.13, p  .145. From the postcondition to the follow-up
assessment, 9 participants (47.4%) in the waitlist condition who
were crossed over to PTSD Coach had a clinically significant
improvement.
In the PTSD Coach condition, PCL improvement from base-
line to the postcondition assessment was unrelated to gender,

Discussion
This is the first study that we are aware of to evaluate a mobile
app for PTSD symptoms with trauma survivors from the commu-
nity. Our findings suggest that PTSD Coach is a feasible interven-
tion for this group, with participants reporting using the app
multiple times per week to learn about PTSD, self-manage symp-
toms, and engage in symptom self-monitoring. Participants also
reported using the app throughout the day (including times outside
of typical clinic hours) across multiple contexts and endorsed few
barriers to use. Likewise, there was clear support for the accept-
ability of PTSD Coach. Participants reported that the major inter-
vention components (i.e., psychoeducation and self-management)
were moderately helpful and they had learned new tools to manage
symptoms and could use skills from the app to manage emotions.
In terms of convenience, participants clearly favored app-delivered
information over paper materials. Finally, open-ended feedback
supported these findings, with more than half of the responses
mentioning symptom self-management as the most useful function
of the app. However, a handful of participants reported that they
did not find the app useful.
Regarding the potential efficacy of PTSD Coach, findings were
less clear, as a significant effect of PTSD Coach over the wait-list
control condition was not apparent. However, there are reasons to
encourage further development and study. First, the between group
effect sizes were modest for both the ITT sample (d  0.25) and
the completer sample (d  0.33), suggesting that failure to detect
a statistical effect may have been due to low statistical power.
Second, the pattern of within group changes showed that the PTSD
Coach condition had a significant reduction in symptoms, whereas
the waitlist did not; however, these were exploratory findings and
so should be interpreted cautiously. Third, when the waitlist par-
ticipants finished serving as controls and were provided the PTSD

PTSD COACH APP FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY

Coach, they showed a significant improvement in PTSD symptoms
similar to the improvement witnessed in the PTSD Coach condi-
tion, essentially replicating those findings (Kazdin, 2003). Fourth,
for the PTSD Coach condition it appears that symptom reduction
persisted at follow-up. Finally, twice as many people using PTSD
Coach reported a clinically significant improvement in PTSD
symptoms compared to those not assigned to use it, but these
results were not significant.
Although the findings are promising, especially from a public
health perspective, they suggest that PTSD Coach may only have
a modest impact on PTSD symptoms. PTSD Coach includes
interventions (e.g., relaxation training, coping self-statements)
found in evidence-based psychotherapies for PTSD, particularly
stress inoculation training, and not surprisingly, does not result in
nearly as large as the effects evidenced in trials of this psycho-
therapy (Foa et al., 2009). Likewise, more intensive-Web based
self-management interventions that typically include some degree
of therapist assistance also appear to provide stronger effects
(Amstadter et al., 2009). The findings also suggest that PTSD
Coach may not be the optimal intervention for all affected trauma
survivors. For example, given that the app provides basic and
widely available psychoeducation and self-management tools, in-
dividuals who have had extensive exposure to these types of
materials or CBT might not find the app as useful as individuals
without such exposure.
There is also suggestion that participants who borrowed an iPod
Touch did not benefit to the same extent as those who used their
own smartphone. Why this is the case is unclear, but others (e.g.,
Smith et al., 2012) have suggested that providing a mobile device
to individuals already carrying one may result in differential use as
a result of the burden imposed by having to carry the additional
device. However, no difference in self-reported weekly use was
evidenced between iPod Touch borrowers and smartphone owners.
In addition, having to learn how to use a new mobile device for
individuals who are not routinely using smartphones may result in
a different experience using the app, which is not captured in usage
data. Although iPod Touch borrowers and smartphone owners did
not significantly differ on baseline PCL scores or demographic
variables, it may be that unmeasured factors related to owning a
smartphone could be responsible for the observed differential
effects.
The current study has a number of limitations requiring mention.
Foremost among these are artifacts related to the pilot nature of
this study. These include those impacting statistical power, such as
the use of a small sample and brief intervention period, which may
not have afforded ample opportunity for accrual of the maximum
benefit from the app. In fact, the PCL decline for the PTSD Coach
participants over the 2 months between the baseline and follow-up
assessments was large (i.e., ds  0 .97 for ITT and 1.06 for
completers). In addition, the retrospective, single-item global mea-
sure of app use may not have been sensitive to variability in actual
use resulting in a failure to detect a relationship with baseline
PTSD symptoms and symptom change. Failure to establish rela-
tionships between measures of use and outcomes is common in
studies of Web-based interventions leading to a recommendation
that composite measures of use may need to be developed to
capture the most important dimensions of program use (Donkin et
al., 2011). Finally, our measures of PTSD Coach acceptability and
feasibility were developed specifically for this project so lack
psychometric evidence; thus, results should be interpreted with
caution.
It is unknown how well these findings would generalize to other
populations of trauma survivors with PTSD symptoms. The cur-
rent sample was predominantly composed of women (80%),
which may reflect that women are estimated to be twice as like to
have PTSD as are men (Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, &
Nelson, 1995) and are also more likely to seek help for it (Roberts,
Gilman, Breslau, Breslau, & Koenen, 2011). The sample also had
a relatively high level of education and recruitment took place in
the Silicon Valley, where the population may be more comfortable
using technology then in other areas. Given that the follow-up
assessment was conducted only a month after conclusion of the
intervention period and after the control participants had been
given the intervention, it cannot be discerned whether results
would generalize to time points further out.
Given these limitations, future research should employ larger
samples to ensure adequate statistical power to evaluate the effi-
cacy of PTSD Coach. In fact, if the true between-group effect size
for PTSD Coach is of the magnitude estimated in the current study,
the observed power to detect it was less than 20%. The current
findings suggest that extending the period of app use and limiting
participation to only smartphone owners would increase the be-

tween group effect size to a medium magnitude or greater, requir-
ing a sample size of roughly 120 participants to achieve adequate
statistical power. Future studies should also include other indica-
tors of app use, which could be achieved by objective, prospective
measures, such as clickstream data collected passively from the
app. Likewise, they should also not rely exclusively on self-report
measures and include assessment of traumatic events as well as
more comprehensive measures (e.g., structured interviews) of
PTSD and related clinical issues (e.g., depression), and other
outcomes the app targets (e.g., willingness to seek treatment) to
assess for potential broader effects of the app. In addition, mea-
sures of other possible mechanisms that may affect outcomes (e.g.,
coping self-efficacy) and moderators of treatment (e.g., PTSD
symptom severity) should also be evaluated. Lastly, to address
issues of external validity, future research should include more
diverse samples (e.g., those with a broader range of educational
achievement, men, and other trauma samples, such as combat
veterans). Such research should also consider including longer-
term follow-up assessments to assess the durability of effects of
PTSD Coach.
Regardless, the current findings contribute to the scant but
emerging literature on the potential of mobile apps for addressing
mental health related issues (Donker et al., 2013). Although more
empirical scrutiny is clearly required, these findings could have
implications for how PTSD symptoms may be addressed espe-
cially from a public health perspective. Although the potential
effect of PTSD Coach appears to be modest, given that smart-
phones are now used by nearly two thirds of U.S. adults (Pew
Research Center, 2015), the app offers an easily accessible, no cost
psychoeducational and self-management tool that can reach large
numbers of affected trauma survivors who may not be receiving
traditional care. Thus, if future research provides more convincing
support for the efficacy of PTSD Coach, it could provide a sig-
nificant benefit to society. Although the current study evaluated
PTSD Coach as a stand-alone intervention, the app could have
many other uses as well that would also be worthy of future
investigation. These include use as a first-line intervention follow-
ing formal PTSD screening (e.g., in primary care settings or for
those waiting to enter specialty treatment), with minimal pro-
fessional assistance (e.g., telephone coaching), as well as an
augment to traditional care, including for patients receiving
pharmacotherapy only and those in psychotherapy to possibly
increase engagement.
