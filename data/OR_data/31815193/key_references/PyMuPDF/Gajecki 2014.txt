Abstract
Background: Brief interventions via the internet have been shown to reduce university students’ alcohol intake.
This study tested two smartphone applications (apps) targeting drinking choices on party occasions, with the goal
of reducing problematic alcohol intake among Swedish university students.
Methods: Students were recruited via e-mails sent to student union members at two universities. Those who gave
informed consent, had a smartphone, and showed risky alcohol consumption according to the Alcohol Use Disorders
Identification Test (AUDIT) were randomized into three groups. Group 1 had access to the Swedish government alcohol
monopoly’s app, Promillekoll, offering real-time estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC) calculation; Group 2 had
access to a web-based app, PartyPlanner, developed by the research group, offering real-time eBAC calculation with
planning and follow-up functions; and Group 3 participants were controls. Follow-up was conducted at 7 weeks.
Results: Among 28574 students offered participation, 4823 agreed to join; 415 were excluded due to incomplete data,
and 1932 fulfilled eligibility criteria for randomization. Attrition was 22.7–39.3 percent, higher among heavier drinkers
and highest in Group 2. Self-reported app use was higher in Group 1 (74%) compared to Group 2 (41%). Per-protocol
analyses revealed only one significant time-by-group interaction, where Group 1 participants increased the frequency
of their drinking occasions compared to controls (p = 0.001). Secondary analyses by gender showed a significant
difference among men in Group 1 for frequency of drinking occasions per week (p = 0.001), but not among women.
Among all participants, 29 percent showed high-risk drinking, over the recommended weekly drinking levels of 9
(women) and 14 (men) standard glasses.
Conclusions: Smartphone apps can make brief interventions available to large numbers of university students. The
apps studied using eBAC calculation did not, however, seem to affect alcohol consumption among university students
and one app may have led to a negative effect among men. Future research should: 1) explore ways to increase user
retention, 2) include apps facilitating technical manipulation for evaluation of added components, 3) explore the effects
of adapting app content to possible gender differences, and 4) offer additional interventions to high-risk users.

Introduction
Approximately 37–50 percent of college and university
students consume alcohol at risky levels [1,2]. Several ef-
fective methods for reducing risky and hazardous drinking
among students have been identified, using information
and early intervention as well as screening and brief inter-
vention (SBI) [3-5]. One central focus of these methods
concerns an individual’s intentions to drink and his or her
behavioral control over alcohol consumption. The Theory
of Planned Behavior (TPB) [6] proposes that a person’s in-
tentions are the foremost determinants of whether the be-
havior is performed or not. Information about the behavior
that is available at any given moment influences intentions
as well as actions. A number of studies confirm that drink-
ing intentions among college students are predictive of
drinking behaviors, and that the intended degree of drink-
ing influences the level of the actual drinking [7-9]. A sec-
ond central focus of effective methods is the use of
protective cognitive and behavioral strategies that aim to
limit alcohol consumption and collateral consequences
[10]. Interventions that include skill training for protective
behavioral strategies have shown an association with less al-
cohol use and alcohol-related consequences [11-13]. Many
alcohol-related prevention programs tailored to college stu-
dents include a skills training component aimed at reducing
intoxication when drinking [4,14,15].
Technology and brief intervention
Students and young people often are reluctant to seek in-
terventions for reducing their drinking behavior when
such interventions are provided by health care profes-
sionals [16]. Short, technology-based interventions for
younger people might contribute to the availability and
access to interventions that could increase health-
oriented behavior change. Indeed, the beneficial effects
of technology-based brief interventions for problematic
alcohol use have been shown for student populations in
several reviews and meta-analyses, where the interven-
tions were delivered via computer—with and without
internet access [17-21].
Since the advent of the smartphone, i.e., mobile tele-
phones providing advanced functionality in addition to
that of regular telephony, more and more people have im-
mediate access to fairly powerful computers close at hand.
In 2013, 94 percent of individuals between 16 and 25 years
of age had access to a smartphone and 88 percent of those
26–35 years old had such access [22]. Smartphones make
it possible to download and run software applications,
commonly referred to as “apps,” the use of which has ex-
ploded since 2008 when the two major venues for down-
loading apps opened—Apple’s App store and Google’s
Play (formerly Android market).
One app sector targets health-related behaviors such as
smoking
and
obesity,
including
problematic
alcohol
consumption. Although over 3000 apps focus on alcohol
consumption, recent reviews indicate that many of the
apps are intended to encourage drinking; and while apps
offering support in reducing problematic alcohol use do
exist, very little research evaluating their effects has been
published [23,24].
Estimating blood alcohol content
One of the most prevalent components of smartphone
apps related to alcohol consumption is the functionality of
calculating and displaying an individual’s estimated blood
alcohol concentration (eBAC) [23,24]. Learning to calcu-
late the eBAC and relating it to its effects on the individ-
ual—both in terms of desirable and positive effects as well
as harmful and negative effects—is an integral part of the
Alcohol Skills Training Program (ASTP) [25] and Brief
Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students
Program (BASICS) [26], information and early interven-
tion
methods
that
have
good
documented
support
[3,4,27]. Calculating and displaying an individual’s eBAC is
a form of personalized feedback, and personalized feed-
back via mail or computer has been found to be an effect-
ive brief intervention [28].
The background motivations for conducting the present
study were twofold. First, the Swedish government-owned
alcohol monopoly (Systembolaget), which has an explicit
mandate to limit health-related harm caused by alcohol,
launched its own app, Promillekoll, in late 2012, offering
users real-time feedback in the form of eBAC. The stated
purpose of the app was to reduce risky and harmful alco-
hol drinking among university students, but its effects
have hitherto not been studied scientifically. Second, the
senior author of this article had conducted a study on an
automated telephony and web-based intervention that of-
fered university students eBAC calculation to reduce risky
drinking [29]. Our research group adapted this interven-
tion into an app format that included an added planning
and follow-up component under the name PartyPlanner.
Aims
This study investigates the effects of two Swedish-language
smartphone apps with real-time eBAC calculation and
feedback among university students with established levels
of risky drinking. Each app was compared to assessment-
only controls. We hypothesized that using each of these
apps would lead to greater reductions in risky drinking than
those seen in the assessment-only control group. Given the
differing levels of alcohol consumption between men and
women, we conducted a secondary analysis to explore
whether there were any gender differences for these two
apps in terms of alcohol outcomes. Earlier studies on gen-
der effects for SBI outcomes are somewhat inconclusive,
with some studies reporting gender differences [30,31] but
later research showing no such differences [32]. As far as
Gajecki et al. Addiction Science & Clinical Practice 2014, 9:11

we know, gender differences in the effects of smartphone-
delivered SBIs have not been previously studied.
In summary, we report analyses of outcomes between
groups with access to each app in comparison to a con-
trol group, additionally examining possible gender dif-
ferences. We further discuss the implications of these
results for university students as well as future research
recommendations.
Methods
Participants
The student unions at Stockholm University and the
Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden,
provided our research group with e-mail addresses for
their current members. We e-mailed study information
and a web page link to all addresses on the lists pro-
vided. Potential participants were informed that com-
pleting baseline and follow-up questionnaires in the
study would automatically include them in a lottery with
three iPad devices as prizes. Those interested in partici-
pation clicked a link directing them to a web page where
they received further information on the Swedish Per-
sonal Data Act, and where they could indicate their
consent to participate in the study. Individuals giving in-
formed consent participated in a data intake process re-
quiring registration of their mobile phone number,
gender, age, and weight. Participants were also asked
whether they had access to a smartphone running either
of the two operating systems, iOS or Android. There-
after, participants filled out baseline questionnaires con-
sisting of the Daily Drinking Questionnaire (DDQ) [33]
and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)
[34]. Participants with an AUDIT score indicating at least
hazardous consumption (≥6 for women and ≥8 for men)
[35] and having a smartphone running either iOS or An-
droid were randomized to one of the two application condi-
tions or to an assessment-only control group. Those not
fulfilling these criteria were excluded from randomization.
One reminder e-mail was sent out 2 days after the first e-
mail to those who had not responded. Study registration was
open for one week. Participants were informed that some
students would be contacted with an e-mail containing a link
to a smartphone app, and that all would be asked to fill in
follow-up questionnaires 6 weeks after registration, a time-
frame based on a study previously conducted by the research
group and commonly used in student alcohol studies [29].
No feedback on baseline consumption levels was given to
any of the participants, regardless of group assignment.
Randomization
All eligible participants were randomized to one of the
two interventions or to a control group with the ratio
(1:1:1), using the randomization function in the IBM SPSS
Statistics for MacOS X, Version 19 (IBM Corp, Armonk,
NY, USA). Participants randomized to an intervention were
sent an e-mail 10 days after the first information e-mail was
sent (3 days after study registration ended) with a link to
access the app to which they had been randomized. Partici-
pants in the intervention groups were instructed to use the
app during the following weeks, in association with events
where alcohol would be consumed. There were no further
prompts to use the application during the period leading
up to the follow-up. Participants were not blind as to
whether or not they were allocated to an intervention con-
dition, but they were not informed that one of the interven-
tions included a planning and follow-up component. The
randomization process was fully automated.
Interventions
1: Promillekoll app (tr. “Check your BAC”): As noted
above, this app was developed by the Swedish govern-
ment’s Systembolaget and is publicly downloadable for
iPhone and Android smartphones. This app was released
for public use on September 25, 2012. The user can regis-
ter his/her alcohol consumption in real time, where the
app displays the user's current eBAC. The Promillekoll
app is theoretically based on the assumption that informa-
tion about one’s own real-time eBAC levels can contribute
to one’s protective cognitive and behavioral strategies. Pro-
millekoll also offers a number of specific strategies to
maintain alcohol consumption at a level that is not harm-
ful—in this case, 0.06 percent BAC. A further mechanism,
congruent with the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) [6],
is that providing information and feedback on risky levels
of eBAC modifies the intention to consume alcohol.
The application warns the user if the drink entered will
result in an eBAC over 0.06 percent and only displays
values up to 0.08 percent. It also provides information
texts on alcohol and BAC. The study was conducted using
a publicly available app, which is constructed as a stand-
alone application that can be used offline. No user data
are collected. The research group had no influence on the
development or functionality of the app.
2: PartyPlanner app. In order to further develop and test
the idea of modifying drinking intentions with an app, our
research group developed a new app, “PartyPlanner,” with
the functionality of simulating or planning a drinking
event beforehand and then comparing the simulation to
the real-time event afterwards. Our hypothesis is that set-
ting up a plan for personal eBAC levels before the drinking
event might explicitly modify the user’s drinking inten-
tions by adapting user perceptions of risk to reality. The
app user would then be able to pace his or her drinking
based on a more realistic view of the amount of alcohol
actually corresponding to a certain eBAC level. Comparing
eBAC levels after the event could increase skillfulness in
future protective behavioral strategies and increase control
when drinking alcohol.

Thus, in addition to registering alcohol consumption
with instant visual eBAC similar to Promillekoll, this app
gives the user the opportunity to simulate an event where
alcohol will be consumed ahead of time. The app displays
the eBAC level at distinct time points throughout the
drinking occasion, both for pre-party simulations and
real-time registrations. Color codes indicate whether the
eBAC is at a risky level. The real-time registration with
feedback can be used as a standalone function; i.e., with-
out having made a prior plan. However, if there is a plan,
the user can visually compare the plan with the logged
real-time event after the actual drinking occasion. In con-
trast to Promillekoll, the PartyPlanner app was launched
as a so-called web app that requires internet connection
using a web browser in order to facilitate additional devel-
opment following this study and prior to possible future,
wider, public accessibility. This app was developed by the
authors in collaboration with Liquid Media AB.
Control group
The third group was a control group that did not receive
any intervention or feedback on risky drinking. Individuals
allocated to this group did not receive any further informa-
tion in the time between study registration and follow-up.
Follow-up
Seven weeks after registration, all participants received an
e-mail inviting them to answer the follow-up question-
naires. One reminder e-mail was sent 4 days after the first
e-mail to initial nonresponders. The e-mails contained a
link to an online questionnaire, where participants filled
out the AUDIT, the DDQ, and answered questions on ac-
cess to other interventions for reducing their alcohol use,
such as speaking with someone else, using web-based ser-
vices, or contacting professional treatment providers. Par-
ticipants in the intervention groups were also asked
whether they had actually used the app and how they liked
it. The entire process was fully automated and no contact
occurred with a human counterpart, but participants were
provided with an e-mail address for technical support and
questions regarding the study.
The follow-up e-mail was sent after 7 weeks rather than
the originally planned 6 weeks due to unforeseen technical
difficulties. The reason for the chosen timespan of 6 weeks
was to facilitate comparison with an earlier study on
digital interventions by the study group targeting the same
population [29].
Seasonality
The study took place in March and April 2013. Swedish
university programming is not based on the concepts of
midterms or finals, so there were no uniform examin-
ation periods during this time. During the intervention
period, two major public holidays occurred: Easter and
Walpurgis Night (April 30). Walpurgis Night is trad-
itionally connected to partying, with high alcohol con-
sumption in Swedish culture.
Ethics
The study was approved by the regional ethics vetting
board in Stockholm (ref. nr. 2012/1126–31/1). Since
Swedish universities are not permitted to organize lotteries,
the iPad lottery was conducted by the charity organization,
Save the Children. See Figure 1 for a participant flowchart.
Design
The study evaluated the effectiveness of access to one of
two smartphone apps addressing risky alcohol use among
university students in Stockholm, Sweden. A randomized,
parallel, three-group, repeated-measures design was used in
which alcohol-related outcomes of two smartphone inter-
vention groups were separately compared to an assessment-
only control group. Participants were assessed at baseline
before trial and at follow-up 7 weeks later. The trial was reg-
istered at clinicaltrials.gov (ref. nr. NCT01958398).
Measures
Participants’ alcohol consumption levels and BAC were
investigated during the trial. To measure quantity and
frequency of alcohol consumption, the DDQ [33] was
used. The instrument was translated into Swedish by
Malmö University, in collaboration with the University
of Washington. Participants were asked to consider a
typical week during the past month and state how many
standard glasses of alcohol they drank and over how
many hours for each day of the current week. They were
also asked to report their peak alcohol consumption
event during the past month in terms of how many
standard glasses they drank during a self-reported num-
ber of hours. This measure has demonstrated good test-
retest reliability in paper format [27].
The eBAC was calculated based on the values from the
DDQ in conjunction with weight and gender for each indi-
vidual. The formula used was the widely known Widmark
formula, as modified and used by the United States Na-
tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration: eBAC (in
parts per mille, as is standard in Sweden) = ([number of
standard glasses] × 12 grams)/([body weight in kg] × C) –
[no. of hours] × 0.15), where C is a gender-specific constant
of 0.68 for men and 0.55 for women [36]. In order to con-
vert the eBAC to percentage values for this article, the
values were divided by 10. In the study, a peak eBAC value
was calculated as the eBAC of the peak alcohol consump-
tion event of the past month. The mean eBAC value was
calculated as the mean of the eBAC values specified for
each day during the typical week reported in the DDQ.
The AUDIT [34] consists of 10 questions measuring
consumption and signs of harm and dependence in
Gajecki et al. Addiction Science & Clinical Practice 2014, 9:11

relation to alcohol. The instrument was used to assess
whether problematic drinking was present and, if so, its
severity. The Swedish version has shown good internal
consistency. The paper version has yielded Cronbach’s α
values of 0.81–0.82 [35,37], and the internet version has
yielded Cronbach’s α values of 0.80–0.93 [38,39].
In order to assess the app usage, self-reported data were
gathered at follow-up on whether the apps had been used
and, if so, how many times. Questions on the users’ per-
ception of the apps were also asked at follow-up.
Definitions
Risky and problematic drinking
No level of alcohol drinking is known to be risk free,
and there is no internationally agreed-upon amount de-
fined as hazardous. Guidelines thus vary considerably,
but risky use in terms of volume consumed is often de-
fined either as a high weekly consumption or high con-
sumption on one occasion (binge drinking). In Sweden,
the Swedish National Institute of Public Health defines
hazardous drinking for men as 14 or more standard
glasses (in Sweden, 12 grams of pure alcohol) in a week,
or five or more standard glasses per occasion. For
women, the limits are nine or more standard glasses in a
week or four or more standard glasses at any one occa-
sion [40]. While binge drinking can be defined as four or
five drinks per occasion, it can also be defined using
BAC, where the level of 0.08 percent is commonly used
[41]. In this study the slightly more conservative level of
0.06 percent was used, which is closer to the 0.055 per-
cent BAC recommended in the BASICS program [26].
In this study, we defined problematic drinking based
on an AUDIT score over the cutoff level for risky or haz-
ardous drinking (≥6 for women and ≥8 for men), thus
also including the categories harmful drinking (≥16 for
men and women) and probable alcohol dependence (≥20
for men and women) [42].
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics were used to describe baseline
characteristics. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used
to identify any baseline differences in age, AUDIT, mean
eBAC, peak eBAC, quantity, frequency, and number of
binge drinking occasions between the groups. Pearson’s
chi-squared tests were used to determine differences be-
tween the groups in proportion of gender and the pro-
portion of participants drinking more than the weekly
recommendation. A linear mixed model analysis was
used to identify changes over time in alcohol consump-
tion outcomes: mean eBAC, peak eBAC, quantity, fre-
quency, and number of binge drinking occasions. These
analyses were conducted per protocol—that is, including
only those participants who reported using the app they
were assigned to—and controlling for three variables:

the number of times the app was accessed, having spoken
to someone about alcohol consumption during the past
12 months, and having accessed the publicly available Pro-
millekoll app prior to the study. For comparison, intention
to treat analyses were performed with all participants who
were randomized to experimental groups and retaining
baseline values for as many participants as possible. No
data imputation procedures were applied.
Descriptive statistics, ANOVA, repeated-measures ANOVA,
and Pearson’s chi-squared analyses were performed
using IBM SPSS Statistics for MacOS X, Version 22
(IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Linear mixed model
analyses were performed using Stata 13 (StataCorp. 2013.
College Station, TX: StataCorp LP.). Values for averages
and standard deviations are presented to three decimal
places in order to make differences visually discernible.
Exclusions
Two participants were identified as extreme outliers at
baseline, one who entered a value of 70 standard glasses
for the peak consumption occasion and another who in-
dicated an age of 90 years. A third participant had left
incomplete data at baseline, and was included in follow-
up due to a technical problem. These three participants
were excluded from all analyses.
Results
Participant characteristics
Baseline participant characteristics did not differ overall
among participants randomized to the three arms of the
trial (see Table 1). In total, the sample consisted of ap-
proximately equal numbers of men and women (48.3%
male, 51.7% female). The mean AUDIT score (10.7, SD =
3.9) indicated hazardous drinking levels, with almost one-
third (29.7%) of the participants drinking more on a
weekly basis than the recommended Swedish guidelines of
less than nine drinks for women and less than 14 for men
per week.
Attrition
The overall attrition rate was 29.4 percent (n = 568); one
participant who asked to terminate his study participation
was included in the attrition group. An analysis comparing
the attrition group with participants who completed the
follow-up (“completers”) showed no significant differences
in gender or age. However, participants in the attrition
group had significantly higher scores on all outcome vari-
ables related to alcohol consumption, except for peak
eBAC per month (see Table 2).
Analyzed by group, attrition was not equal. The Party-
Planner group had a higher attrition rate, at 39.3 per-
cent, compared to the Promillekoll (26.4%) and control
(22.7%) groups [χ2 (2, 1929) = 46.633, p < 0.001]. A sub-
analysis revealed that in the PartyPlanner group, all al-
cohol consumption-related baseline values were higher
among the attrited individuals than among those who
completed the follow-up; the same was true for all base-
line values except for frequency and number of binge
drinking occasions per week in the control group. For
the Promillekoll group, there were no differences in
baseline values between completers and the attrited
group. Significantly more of the men (43.9%) in the Par-
tyPlanner group did not complete follow-up in com-
parison to the women (35.3%) [χ2 (1, 639) = 4.975, p =
0.026]; there were no gender differences for follow-up
rates in the other two groups.
App use
Over one-third of the participants in all three groups
had tried Promillekoll before initiation of the study.

Fewer PartyPlanner participants (41.4%) reported having
used the PartyPlanner app during the study period, com-
pared to Promillekoll participants (74.1%; χ2 (1, 845) =
92.844, p < 0.001).
Other interventions and prior experiences of Promillekoll
Between 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent of all study partici-
pants reported having used pharmaceutical medications in
order to reduce alcohol consumption during the 12 months
preceding the follow-up, and between 0.8 percent and 2.6
percent reported having accessed help other than medica-
tions or speaking to someone about their use.
Over 20 percent in each group reported at follow-up
that they had spoken with someone about their alcohol
consumption during the prior 12 months.
Usability data
Users rated the two apps for ease of use, suitability, and
likelihood of recommending it to a friend. The only signifi-
cant difference between the two apps was that Promillekoll
participants rated ease of use higher (4.0) than PartyPlanner
participants (3.2) (see Table 3).
Outcome analyses
Time-by-group interactions were investigated using linear
mixed models analyses, separately comparing each app
group (per protocol) to the control group and controlling
for the number of app-use occasions, earlier use of Pro-
millekoll, and having spoken to someone about alcohol
consumption over the past 12 months. A Bonferroni cor-
rection of p = 0.003 was applied throughout. For the Party-
Planner group, no significant time-by-group interactions
for any outcome measures occurred. For the Promillekoll
group, app users showed a significant increase in drinking
frequency compared to the control group [Z = 3.39, p =
0.001] (see Table 4).
The three covariates were all significant: number of app-
use occasions [Z = 8.24, p < 0.001]; having spoken to some-
one about alcohol consumption in the past 12 months [Z =
3.73, p < 0.001]; and having tried Promillekoll before the
study [Z = 2.62, p = 0.001].
An intention-to-treat analysis including all users re-
gardless of reported app use, and not controlling for any
other factors, did not yield any significant differences be-
tween the groups.
At follow-up, the proportion of group members having
a weekly consumption over the recommended level
remained more than 25 percent (Control group: 26.4%,
PartyPlanner: 26.7%, and Promillekoll: 28.8%).
Secondary outcome analyses
Outcomes were also analyzed secondarily to identify any
gender differences. Outcomes for male participants showed
two significant time-by-group effects in the per-protocol
analysis. Male participants in the Promillekoll group with
reported app use increased their drinking frequency from
baseline to follow-up, in comparison to control group par-
ticipants (Z = 3.48, p = 0.001). One covariate was significant:
number of app-use occasions [Z = 5.80, p < 0.001].
Discussion
This study compared the effects of two smartphone apps
for reducing overconsumption of alcohol at single-party oc-
casions among Swedish university students to assessment-
only controls. Both apps relied on mathematical estimates
of blood alcohol concentration. The apps differed in con-
tent. The Promillekoll app offered information texts on
different eBAC levels as well as strategies for avoiding
risky drinking. The PartyPlanner app did not offer any

explanatory texts but included a component allowing par-
ticipants to plan their drinking in advance. Because of these
differences in the apps, as well as difficulties in assessing
which factors might be instrumental in any observed
change in outcome, we chose to compare each app only to
the control group and not to each other. Also, because the
proportion of participants who actually used the app was
significantly lower in the PartyPlanner group, we chose to
focus on per-protocol analyses only, including participants
who reported having used each app. We chose to control
our analyses with three covariates. One concerned prior ac-
cess to the Promillekoll app, which had been available for
public access for over 5 months at the beginning of our
study. Over one-third of app participants had used it before
our study. The PartyPlanner was launched at the same time
as this study and is not publicly available at this writing.
The second covariate concerned access to other modes of
help for alcohol consumption during the 12 months pre-
ceding the follow-up. We assessed three categories of help:
medication, speaking to someone about alcohol consump-
tion, and accessing other types of help such as internet-
based interventions. About one in five participants reported
having spoken to someone about their consumption in the
previous 12 months. The third covariate concerned the
number of times intervention group participants had
used the app. The results showed only one time-by-
group interaction, where Promillekoll participants showed
a significant increase in drinking occasion frequency in
comparison to controls. The proportion of students drink-
ing more than the weekly Swedish recommendation of
nine drinks for women and 14 for men appeared to re-
main stable over time at approximately 25–30 percent of
all study participants.
It is not clear why Promillekoll users increased the fre-
quency of their drinking at the same time that they did
not, as a group, consume larger quantities of alcohol. We
can only speculate that app users may have felt more
confident that they could rely on the app to reduce nega-
tive effects of drinking and therefore felt able to drink
more often.
The secondary gender-focused analyses suggest that
male participants were the source of the increase in drink-
ing frequency in the Promillekoll group. This finding sug-
gests that it might be interesting to test gender-related
hypotheses about the mechanisms steering the drinking
behavior of male and female university students when
using smartphone apps. One speculation is that real-time
use of a smartphone app might trigger men to compete
with their peers in a competitive “drinking game”. How-
ever, Promillekoll does not display eBACs over 0.08 per-
cent, thus effectively setting an upper limit to how far the
“game” can go. Interestingly, we did not see the same
phenomenon in the PartyPlanner group. One reason could
well be that attrition was significantly higher in the Party-
Planner group than in the other two groups, and where a
higher proportion of men in the PartyPlanner group had
dropped out. Moreover, these dropouts had higher levels
of baseline alcohol consumption, a pattern not seen in the
other two groups. It is also possible that individuals who
might have been triggered to drink more frequently when
having access to a smartphone app were present to a
higher extent in the Promillekoll group.
Regarding the significance of covariates, the number of
app-use occasions was associated with increases in out-
comes in the analyses, possibly because those who drank
more frequently had more opportunities to use the app
than those who did not. This explanation could also apply
to the other covariates, where an individual with higher
levels of alcohol consumption might be more likely to try
out apps for controlling it. They might also be more likely
to speak to someone about their consumption.
The study took place over Easter and Walpurgis Night,
both high-consumption holidays. These events may have
led to seasonal spikes in consumption and may have

affected the reported levels of consumption; however, this
effect is most probably equal for all participants.
Strengths and limitations
An important strength of this study is that it is, to our
knowledge, one of the first effectiveness studies on apps
for health-related behavior change for reducing risky al-
cohol consumption. A second strength is that this is the
first randomized controlled study conducted with the
Promillekoll app, which was released publicly by System-
bolaget in the fall of 2012 following research-based de-
velopment and a qualitative usability study. Thirdly, we
studied university students, a highly important target
group in that both risky alcohol drinking and smart-
phone app use are quite prevalent. It is possible to reach
a large population of students easily and directly via e-
mail addresses, facilitating this study and future research
with this group. The design also ensures a minimum of
human interaction, a possible advantage given the stigma
attached to overconsumption of alcohol [43], and which
potential participants might experience as an obstacle.
The attrition rates in this study (over 30% overall; see
Table 2) were somewhat lower than in other studies of
electronically delivered SBIs, where attrition rates over
time periods of 4–6 weeks ranged between 36.7 percent
and 44.8 percent [44-46].
This study was also subject to several limitations. First,
we had no information on possible differences between
student union members who entered the study and those
who did not. Among those invited to participate, only 16.9
percent gave informed consent. One reason for this could
be that a certain proportion of our e-mails did not reach
the recipients due to spam e-mail filters or to changes in
e-mail addresses. We are therefore unsure of how repre-
sentative this sample is of the total student population.
What is clear, however, is that prevalence rates of prob-
lematic drinking in this sample were consistent with earl-
ier studies targeting university students in Sweden and the
US [1,2]. Secondly, the two smartphone interventions dif-
fered significantly in graphic design and technical presenta-
tion. Moreover, the Promillekoll app had been publicly
available for over 5 months before this study was launched.
These circumstances made it difficult to conduct any
meaningful comparison between the two apps, so we
chose to compare each of them individually to the control
group. Under ideal laboratory conditions, we would have
added the planning and follow-up function that was part
of PartyPlanner to the Promillekoll intervention, in order
to facilitate participants’ awareness of the extra peda-
gogical functions in the PartyPlanner app. In this case, the
apps were produced by different designers, confounding
design and format with content. Thirdly, the attrition rates
in the two intervention groups differed significantly. Some
of the participants who completed the follow-up left
written comments on the PartyPlanner app. Their com-
ments indicated that they disliked the technical web-based
app solution, which required continuous internet connec-
tion. This may have caused time lags in app response that
may have further deterred participants from using the
app, and may have contributed to attrition. Our attrition
analysis showed that completers and noncompleters in
both the control and PartyPlanner groups differed on
baseline characteristics measuring alcohol consumption,
whereas Promillekoll participants did not. We are not sure
why the Promillekoll app had a more equal distribution of
baseline characteristics between the attriters and com-
pleters, but Promillekoll was released following a rigorous
design process, and this may have led to a more pleasant
user experience, which in turn led to higher retention. The
Promillekoll app has also been extensively advertised in
Sweden and participants may have been more curious to
participate in its testing. The difference in attrition rates
may also have contributed to our finding of significant dif-
ferences for Promillekoll participants, since this sample
may have been more representative in that men with higher
levels of alcohol use—and possibly prone to engaging in
competitive games—were retained in the sample. High-
alcohol consumers in the PartyPlanner group, on the other
hand, dropped out to a larger extent; these may also have
been individuals with higher impulsivity, lower acceptance
of frustration, and consequently, a lower tolerance for lag
times. The results may have been tipped in favor of Party-
Planner, given that fewer of the individuals with higher
levels of alcohol consumption participated in follow-up.
A final limitation in the study is the lack of objective
user data available for the apps. For the Promillekoll app,
this was due to the fact that the app was programmed as a
standalone app without data transmission on usage to any
server. Our research group had no influence on the design
and programming of this app. The PartyPlanner app, on
the other hand, was developed by the research group and
the possibility of accessing objective user data was in-
cluded in the design. However, technical difficulties com-
plicated the extraction of these data. We chose instead to
rely on self-reported user data on whether participants
had used the app, and on how many occasions. While
these data may be subject to error, particularly given the
unclear definition of “app use” as well as the number of
app-use occasions, the extent of the error is approximately
comparable. Had we used objective data for one app and
self-report data for the other, we might have compromised
the reliability of our comparisons to the control group
even more.
A final ethical issue of note in this study is the fact
that controls were not offered any specific intervention
to address their risky alcohol use. Control group partici-
pants and intervention group participants received a rec-
ommendation to contact student health services both at
Gajecki et al. Addiction Science & Clinical Practice 2014, 9:11

registration and at follow-up if they felt concerned about
their drinking. Also, at the end of the study, a consider-
able proportion of the students were above the levels for
recommended weekly consumption, but they were not
offered any further interventions or referral.
Conclusions
Overall, participation in our study did not seem to affect
drinking in any of the three study groups. However, the
Promillekoll app seemed to be associated with a negative
effect in the form of an increased number of drinking oc-
casions over one week. Our conclusion from this study is
that eBAC calculation in the app form is not effective for
reducing alcohol consumption among university students.
Future development of apps with this purpose may require
additional input to supplement eBAC feedback.
Our secondary analysis suggests that there might be
gender differences in how apps are used in the context
of risky drinking among university students. The Promil-
lekoll app produced by the Systembolaget had one pos-
sible negative effect for the men, but not for the women.
The PartyPlanner app, with the additional functionality
of planning ahead and comparing real drinking events
with plans, did not seem to negatively affect men. How-
ever, participants in this trial arm had a higher dropout
rate, consisting to a larger extent of male participants
with higher alcohol consumption, in comparison to the
Promillekoll and control groups. Further research is thus
necessary to explore gender differences in the use of
apps in this context. Such research should investigate
which app features are associated with higher participant
retention, as well as whether app design needs to take
gender factors into account.
Future research should use a uniform design for apps
with different intervention components in order to control
for the confounding effects of differing designs. This
would enable isolation of component effects from design
and technical differences between apps. Finally, an import-
ant area of future research is offering further help to indi-
viduals drinking more than the recommended weekly
levels who are identified through such research. Although
we referred all individuals concerned about their drinking
to student health services in this study, we suspect that
many might be reluctant to approach such services.
Some might not be aware of the harmful nature of their
drinking, whereas others might experience approaching
student services as stigmatizing. One possibility would
be to offer more indepth automated interventions to in-
dividuals drinking more than the recommended levels
in a separate, secondary study.
