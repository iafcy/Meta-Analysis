Abstract
Background: This study is one of the first randomized controlled trials investigating cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
(CBT-I) delivered by a fully automated mobile phone app. Such an app can potentially increase the accessibility of insomnia
treatment for the 10% of people who have insomnia.
Objective: The objective of our study was to investigate the efficacy of CBT-I delivered via the Sleepcare mobile phone app,
compared with a waitlist control group, in a randomized controlled trial.
Methods: We recruited participants in the Netherlands with relatively mild insomnia disorder. After answering an online pretest
questionnaire, they were randomly assigned to the app (n=74) or the waitlist condition (n=77). The app packaged a sleep diary,
a relaxation exercise, sleep restriction exercise, and sleep hygiene and education. The app was fully automated and adjusted itself
to a participant’s progress. Program duration was 6 to 7 weeks, after which participants received posttest measurements and a
3-month follow-up. The participants in the waitlist condition received the app after they completed the posttest questionnaire.
The measurements consisted of questionnaires and 7-day online diaries. The questionnaires measured insomnia severity,
dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and anxiety and depression symptoms. The diary measured sleep variables such as sleep
efficiency. We performed multilevel analyses to study the interaction effects between time and condition.
Results: The results showed significant interaction effects (P<.01) favoring the app condition on the primary outcome measures
of insomnia severity (d=–0.66) and sleep efficiency (d=0.71). Overall, these improvements were also retained in a 3-month
follow-up.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated the efficacy of a fully automated mobile phone app in the treatment of relatively mild
insomnia. The effects were in the range of what is found for Web-based treatment in general. This supports the applicability of
such technical tools in the treatment of insomnia. Future work should examine the generalizability to a more diverse population.
Furthermore, the separate components of such an app should be investigated. It remains to be seen how this app can best be
integrated into the current health regimens.

Introduction
Approximately 10% of the western adult population have
chronic insomnia [1]. People with insomnia experience
difficulties falling asleep, staying asleep, or both, and as a
consequence they are sleep deprived during the day [2]. For
example, insomnia is associated with low levels of
concentration, greater fatigue, and impaired cognitive
functioning [3-5]. Another consequence of insomnia is an
increased risk of developing mental disorders such as depression
and anxiety [6,7], or physical disorders such as diabetes and
high blood pressure [8,9]. Insomnia also leads to societal costs
such as reduced productivity, higher levels of sick leave, and
more accidents [10].
One of the most common nonpharmacological treatments for
insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-I). CBT-I is an
effective treatment in either a face-to-face [11-13] or a self-help
format [14,15]. Recently it has become more common to offer
these self-help formats via the Internet. A recent meta-analysis
[16] demonstrated that Internet-delivered CBT-I showed large
treatment effects (Cohen d=1.0) on the Insomnia Severity Index
(ISI). In addition to the efficacy of computerized CBT-I
(CCBT-I), this format has multiple other advantages over
face-to-face treatments. Potentially it can save costs, because
less therapist time is needed, and the treatment can be offered
to a larger number of people who can go through the treatment
in their own time.
Until now, studies on computerized treatments have been mostly
limited to Web-based treatments. A possible next step is
delivering CCBT-I via a mobile phone app. CCBT-I delivered
via a mobile phone has similar advantages to existing CCBT-I,
such as wide and easy accessibility, reduced stigma, and greater
cost-efficiency [17], but it could potentially exceed those
advantages because mobile phones are portable. People carry
their phones with them all the time and they are ubiquitous,
unobtrusive, and intimate. Therefore, an effective app-based
treatment for insomnia would increase the possible coverage
for CBT-I. Furthermore, mobile phones are rich in sensors,
computationally powerful, and remotely accessible, which
provides 
opportunities 
for 
personalization, 
ecological
momentary access, and real-time tracking [18,19].
In the domain of sleep, several kinds of sleep apps have been
studied. For example, there is an app that unobtrusively increases
awareness of sleep hygiene recommendations [20], an app that
applies active sleep sampling for measuring sleep [21], a social
app that shares time in bed based on alarm usage [22], and an
app that supports and was used alongside of face-to-face CBT-I.
To the best of our knowledge, however, no studies have
evaluated the efficacy of stand-alone CCBT-I apps. To bridge
this gap, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare
a group using a CCBT-I-based app with a waitlist control group.
We expected that this app would have an ameliorating effect
on insomnia severity and sleep impairment compared with the
waitlist control group, assessed by a sleep diary.
The app offered a sleep diary, a relaxation exercise, sleep
restriction exercise, and sleep hygiene and education. Since
sleep restriction is seen as the most effective exercise [23,24],
it was the main focus of the app. The goal was to demonstrate
the app’s efficacy in a sample of patients with relatively mild
insomnia in order to test the proof of principle before
investigating it in a more severely affected population.
Methods
This study had a between-participants design with 2 arms: a
waitlist condition and an intervention condition, with
preintervention, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up
measures.
Participants
We recruited participants from August 15 to October 21, 2015,
via websites, social media, online advertisements, flyers, and a
press release in the Netherlands. An initial group of 639
interested individuals completed an informed consent form and
started the online questionnaire. Of this group, we excluded 269
people based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Figure
1; Multimedia Appendix 1 [25]). Inclusion criteria were (1)
difficulty with initiating or maintaining sleep for at least 30
minutes a night, for at least 3 nights a week, for at least 3
months, causing clinically significant distress or impairment in
daily functioning, in accordance with the criteria for a
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)
diagnosis of insomnia [2], (2) stable medication use, (3) aged
≥18 years, and (4) a valid email address, connected to the
Internet, and in possession of an Android mobile phone
(operating system version 4.1 or higher). Exclusion criteria were
(1) ISI score [26] <7, (2) previous treatment with CBT-I (3)
having started other psychotherapy in the last 6 months, (4)
self-reported diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychosis, (5) alcohol
or marijuana abuse (>3 glasses of alcohol a day for at least 21
days a month, or use of marijuana more than once a week), (6)
possible sleep apnea (determined with a subscale of the
SLEEP-50 questionnaire; cut off ≥15 [27]), (7) shift work, (8)
pregnant or breast-feeding, (9) symptoms of depression
(determined with a subscale of the Centre for Epidemiological
Studies Depression [CES-D] scale [28,29]; cutoff ≥27), or (10)
total sleep time ≤5 hours on average as reported in a consecutive
7-day sleep diary prior to the experiment. We measured all
inclusion and exclusion criteria, except the last one, using an
online questionnaire asking the participants directly about the
criteria (see Multimedia Appendix 2).

Intervention
The Sleepcare app [30,31] was based on previously published
protocols (eg, [32,33]) and followed a talk-and-tool design
principle, which is based on the idea that people interact
symbolically and physically with their environment (see [34]
for more details on the rationale and design decisions). The app
packaged a sleep diary, a relaxation exercise, sleep restriction

exercise, and sleep hygiene and education (Figure 2). The app
offered these exercises in Dutch, adjusted them to the
participant, and reminded participants to perform the exercises.
The basic program duration was 6 to 7 weeks, depending on a
participant’s adherence. For example, if a participant had filled
out <6 sleep diaries since starting the app, the app explained to
the participant that the sleep restriction exercise could start only
after they had completed 6 diaries. If they had completed <6
diaries, the introduction of the sleep restriction exercise was
postponed until participants met this prerequisite. The app was
fully automated and did not require any input from therapists
or a human administrator. Automatic warnings were built in
when participants slept for <5 hours on average. The first
warning appeared after 5 days and warned against activities
such as driving a car while feeling sleepy. Follow-up warnings
also included a referral to the general practitioner, and the app
automatically stopped the sleep restriction exercise.
The app consisted of a home screen that displayed the scheduled
exercises for that day. Furthermore, there was a menu, a
calendar, and a conversation screen (Figure 3). The menu
provided access to all components of the app and the CBT-I
exercises. The calendar displayed all the scheduled activities
for the whole 7 weeks, which the participants could browse
through at any time. The app interacted with the participants
via dialogues on the conversation screen.

Conversations
The conversation screen (Figure 3) displayed the dialogues
between the app and the participants, which were inspired by
face-to-face consultations. New exercises were introduced, and
the progress of the participants was evaluated. Typically, the
app gave information and asked multiple-choice questions.
Participants could open new conversations only after the
previous conversation was finished. Conversations were initiated
by the app based on a participant’s adherence and progress. For
example, if a relaxation exercise was done <3 times within 4
days of its introduction, a conversation would start to address
the participant’s adherence. Additionally, the app started
conversations based on a participant’s progress; for example,
after the participant had filled out the sleep diary for a week,
the app calculated and showed weekly sleep efficiency averages
in an evaluation conversation. A detailed description of the
underlying design principles can be found in Beun et al [34].
CBT-I Exercises
Sleep Diary
The sleep diary was a visual translation of the core Consensus
Sleep Diary [35] consisting of 4 screens asking participants to
fill in their bedtimes and wake times, and their subjective sleep
quality. The sleep diary could only be filled out for the previous
night. Connected to the sleep diary was the sleep overview,
which gave a visual summary of the participant’s sleep.

Relaxation Exercise
Relaxation exercises have a long history for treating insomnia.
Based on the idea that hyperarousal is a main determinant of
insomnia, relaxation exercises are the designated treatment [36].
The relaxation exercise was a progressive muscle relaxation
exercise of varying durations, ranging from 1 to 16 minutes.
The participants could choose the length of the exercise
themselves before starting the exercise. By being offered short
exercises, participants were able to gradually develop the habit
of relaxing. The participants were guided by a voice track, which
told them which muscles to contract and when to relax. The app
advised participants to do the relaxation exercise once a day,
although participants could do the exercises as often as they
wanted [37].
Modified Sleep Restriction
Sleep restriction is seen as the most effective exercise [23,24],
and therefore was the main focus of the app. After a week, the
app introduced the modified sleep restriction exercise, on
condition that participants had filled ≥6 sleep diaries and had
an average sleep efficiency of <85%. We developed an
algorithm to calculate the ideal and maximum time in bed for
that specific participant based on the average sleep times of the
previous week (FGB, unpublished data, 2016). The algorithm
used rules such as (1) the ideal time in bed is equal to the
average time in bed, (2) the maximum time in bed is always at
least 1 hour less than the average time in bed, (3) the advised
time in bed is never <5 hours [38], and (4) the advised time in
bed lies between average total sleep time and average time in
bed. Participants had the opportunity to negotiate their sleep
time. The app first suggested that the participant abide by the
ideal time in bed. The participant was then given the option to
accept that time in bed, to negotiate longer time in bed up to
the calculated maximum time in bed, or to refrain from sleep
restriction completely. Participants were allowed to negotiate
about and refrain from the sleep restriction exercise in order to
enhance self-empowerment, set realistic goals, and thereby
increase adherence. Every week the app evaluated the adherence
and effect of the sleep restriction exercise. When participants’
sleep efficiency was >85%, they were allowed 15 minutes extra
in bed. When a participant’s average sleep efficiency was <85%,
the app suggested the same or a further restriction of 15 minutes,
depending on a participant’s adherence. We used a modified
sleep restriction protocol because we assumed this would
increase the possibility of completing the restriction exercise,
on the basis that more lenient sleep restriction is better than no
sleep restriction at all.
Sleep Hygiene and Education
Sleep 
hygiene 
and 
education 
consist 
of 
lifestyle
recommendations and knowledge about sleep. As a
single-component intervention, it lacks efficacy [13]. However,
it lays the foundation for CBT-I, since it increases participants’
knowledge about sleep and the factors influencing sleep. By
increasing understanding, sleep hygiene and education increase
the efficacy of the other CBT-I exercises, and are therefore
included in many multicomponent interventions [36]. Sleep
hygiene and education information was presented on different
screens as tips and facts in text format. The tips were divided
into 3 categories: (1) food and drink, (2) bedroom, and (3)
behavior. “Use your bedroom only for sleeping, not for working”
was an example of a bedroom tip. The sleep facts were
categorized into 8 groups: (1) sleep cycles, (2) amount of sleep,
(3) age, (4) animals, (5) disorders, (6) causes, (7) sleep medicine,
and (8) fun facts. An example of a fact about age is “The amount
of sleep a person needs is age dependent.”
Persuasive Strategies
We implemented various kinds of persuasive strategies to
support the participants’ adherence. First, the app sent
notifications for both the exercises and the conversations. So,
for a scheduled exercise such as filling in the sleep diary, the
app sent the participants a notification. For unfinished
conversations, additional reminders were sent every day at noon.
Second, the app provided room for negotiation about the sleep
restriction assignment as described earlier. Furthermore, the
app was designed to be easy to use and attractive, to improve
adherence [31,39].
Measurements
Questionnaire Measures
Primary Measure
We measured the severity of insomnia with a Dutch translation
of the widely used ISI. This is a 7-item questionnaire with scores
ranging from 0 (no insomnia) to 28 (severe insomnia). A cutoff
score of 7 determined relatively mild insomnia [26]. We set the
cutoff score at this level instead of the clinically more relevant
cutoff score of 10 [40] because the goal of this study was to
demonstrate the feasibility of the app in a sample of patients
with at least subclinical levels of insomnia.
Secondary Measures
The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rating scale
that measures sleep disturbances over a 1-month period [41].
The PSQI consists of 19 items with scores from 0 to 3 evaluating
7 subdomains. The scores of these subdomains are summed to
calculate a global score ranging from 0 to 21. A global score
>5 indicates severe impairment in at least two domains, or
moderate impairment in at least three domains.
We measured dysfunctional beliefs with the Dutch translation
of the brief Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep
(DBAS-16) scale [42]. The DBAS-16 consists of 16 statements
with scores from 0 to 10 to indicate how much people agree
with the statement. The average is calculated so that the total
score ranges from 0 (no dysfunctional beliefs) to 10 (severe
dysfunctional beliefs).
Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the 7 anxiety items of
the Dutch version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS) [43,44]. The summed score ranges from 0 (no
symptoms of anxiety) to 21 (severe symptoms of anxiety).
Depressive symptoms were measured using a Dutch translation
of the CES-D scale. The CES-D consists of 20 items with scores
ranging from 0 to 3, which are summed, with higher scores
indicating more depressive symptoms [28,29].

Diary Measures
We used an online Dutch translated version of the consensus
sleep diary [35]. Participants filled out the sleep diary for 7
days. In the diary they recorded the time they went to bed, the
time they tried to go to sleep, their time of final awakening,
their time out of bed, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset,
terminal wakefulness, number of awakenings, sleep quality (1
= “very bad” to 10 = “very good”), and use of sleep medication.
From these variables, we calculated the time in bed (time in
bed=final arising time–time of going to bed), sleep time (total
sleep time=time in bed–sleep onset latency–wake after sleep
onset–terminal wakefulness), and sleep efficiency (sleep
efficiency=[total sleep time/time in bed]×100). Sleep efficiency
was the second primary measure in this trial.
Process Measures
We measured motivation to use the app with the Situational
Motivation Scale [45] and acceptance of the app with the unified
theory of acceptance and use of technology [46]. The focus of
this paper is on the outcome measures, so we do not include the
results of the process measures.
Procedure
Participants gave online informed consent and filled out the
questionnaire addressing the inclusion and exclusion criteria,
demographic information, and the outcome measures. The
participants who met the study criteria received a link to an
online sleep diary by email for 7 successive days. Emails for
the diary were sent at 6.00 AM, and a reminder email was sent
at 10.00 AM. We excluded participants who reported an average
total sleep time of <5 hours and then randomly assigned the
others to either the app or the waitlist condition. Randomization
was carried out by a third party who was not part of this study.
They used an online tool [47] to generate blocks of 20
participants. The list of the randomization sequence was kept
in a locked office cupboard by the third party. After participants
were assigned to a condition, participants and the principal
investigator (CH) were no longer blinded to the condition
allocation.
Then, 3 weeks after starting with the app or the waitlist
condition, all participants received an interim measurement
consisting of the ISI and DBAS-16, supplemented with questions
regarding motivation (Situational Motivation Scale) and app
acceptance for the app group. These interim measures are not
reported in this paper. Both groups received a postintervention
questionnaire, 7 weeks after random assignment, consisting of
all the outcome measures (ISI, PSQI, DBAS-16, CES-D, and
HADS) and a 7-day diary. In addition, participants in the app
group received questions regarding the effect and utility of the
app, which are not reported in this paper. After completing the
diary, participants in the waitlist condition received the app.
Participants in the app condition additionally received a 3-month
follow-up questionnaire and diary.
The study was approved by the internal Ethical Review Board
of the University of Amsterdam, and was registered with the
Netherlands Trial Register (NTR5560).
Statistical Analysis
Required Statistical Power
To our knowledge, this study is the first large-scale randomized
controlled trial to study an app to treat chronic insomnia, so
expected effects were unknown. Earlier research about
Web-based CBT-I found a Cohen d>1.0 [48,49]. We were
uncertain whether these large effects could also be obtained by
an app, so we anticipated an average effect. A power calculation
for a mixed analysis of variance design (effect: f2=0.15, power
80%, alpha=.05) indicated that a total of 90 participants were
needed to detect a potential difference between the 2 conditions.
As a meta-analysis showed that on average 50% of people
adhere to technology-mediated insomnia treatment [50], the
goal was set to include 180 participants.
Analyses
We tested the effects of the intervention using multilevel
analyses, which allows for the inclusion of participants with 1
measurement and therefore is appropriate for intention-to-treat
analyses [51]. Models were built in R version 3.1.3 (The R
Foundation) to explore within-group (time), between-group
(condition: app vs waitlist), and interaction (time × condition)
effects. Model 0 is the basic model and includes only the
participants as a random intercept. Model 1 adds the fixed factor
time to model 0. Model 2 was built on model 1 and adds the
condition as a fixed effect. Finally, model 3 adds the interaction
effect between time and condition. Models 4 and 5 concern the
premeasurement and follow-up data. Model 4 is the null model
that includes only the participants as a random intercept. In
model 5 time is added. Since there were no follow-up
measurements for the waitlist, condition is not included. Dropout
analyses for the postmeasurements showed that age, sleep
quality, and terminal wakefulness were associated with
nonresponse in the app condition. In the waitlist condition,
number of awakenings was related to nonresponse. Dropout
analyses for the follow-up measurements showed that terminal
wakefulness was associated with nonresponse. Therefore, they
were added as covariates in all models in the multilevel
regression analyses [51]. We calculated chi-squares for the
various models to compare the ability of the models to fit the
data. Furthermore, we calculated R2 values to indicate the level
of variance explained by the level-1 variables [52]. R2 values
of .10 indicate a small effect, R2=.30 indicates a medium effect,
and R2=.50 indicates a large effect [53].
To enhance comparability with other studies, we calculated
between-group Cohen d values. Table 1 shows the means and
effect sizes based on an imputed dataset. First, we used multiple
imputation in IBM SPSS version 22 (IBM Corporation) to insert
missing cases [54]. Data from 41-44 participants (27.2%-29.1%)
were missing for the outcome questionnaires. Diaries were
missing from 76 of the 151 participants (50.3%). The follow-up
measurements were not imputed due to a large amount of
missing data. For imputation, we used the pre- and post
measures of the ISI, PSQI, DBAS-16, CES-D, HADS, sleep
quality, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, number of
awakenings, time in bed, terminal wakefulness, total sleep time,
and sleep efficiency, next to sex and age. With a predictive

mean matching procedure, 10 separate datasets were generated.
The values in Table 1 are based on these imputed datasets.
Second, we calculated Cohen d values by dividing the difference
in change scores by the pooled standard deviation of that change
score (d=[meanchange score waitlist–meanchange score app]/SDpooled),
whereby meanchange score=meanpre–meanpost. We calculated
within-group Cohen d values using the pre- and post scores per
condition 
and 
the 
pooled 
standard 
deviation
(d=[meanpre–meanpost]/SDpooled). Additionally, we calculated
within-group Cohen d values with the pre- and follow-up scores
per 
condition 
and 
the 
pooled 
standard 
deviation
(d=[meanpre–meanfollow-up]/SDpooled) (Table 2). A Cohen d of
0.20 indicates a small effect, 0.50 a moderate effect, and 0.80
a large effect [53].

Results
Baseline Characteristics of the Sample
We randomly assigned 151 participants to the app (n=74) or a
waitlist condition (n=79). Participants had a mean age of 39.66
years (SD 13.44; range 18-80). Of the total 151 participants, 94
were female (62.3%). Table 3 shows demographic information
about the participants, as well as the randomization check. At
baseline, the groups did not differ significantly on any
demographic characteristics (all P values >.05).
Efficacy: Intention-to-Treat Analyses
Table 1 displays the mean scores for all the outcome measures
and corresponding Cohen d values for the baseline and
postmeasurements. Table 2 displays the mean scores for the
follow-up measures. Figure 4 depicts the scores for the main
outcome measures ISI and sleep efficiency. Table 4 and Table
5 present the results of the multilevel analyses. Table 4 shows
the coefficients for model 3 and their standard errors, and
whether the coefficients were significant. Table 5 shows whether
there was a significant difference between the models (χ2) and
the level of variance explained (R2). The multilevel analyses
showed significant interaction effects between time and
condition on the primary outcome measures ISI (d=–0.66) and
sleep efficiency (d=0.71) at posttest. These effects indicate that
the app was more effective than the waitlist condition.
Furthermore, wake after sleep onset, number of awakenings,
PSQI, CES-D, and HADS improved and showed significant
interaction effects (Table 4 and Table 5), but sleep onset latency,
time in bed, terminal wakefulness, total sleep time, and
DBAS-16 showed no significant effects at posttest. At
follow-up, improvements on all outcome measures remained
significant, except for number of awakenings.

Among the participants who completed the pre- and posttest,
we found a clinically meaningful change on the ISI (∆ISI≥8)
[40] between the waitlist and the app conditions. We also
observed a significant clinically meaningful change 20 times
in the app condition (20/45, 44%) and 7 times in the waitlist
condition (7/62, 11%) at the posttest. In the app condition,
significantly more people reached a meaningful clinical change
(χ2
1=15.19, P<.001). Before treatment, all participants had an
ISI score >7 [26]. Of the participants who completed the
posttest, 17 in the app condition (17/45, 38%) and 6 in the
waitlist condition (6/62, 10%) had an ISI score ≤7. In the app
condition, significantly more participants dropped below the
insomnia threshold of ISI ≤7 than in the waitlist condition
(χ2
1=12.20, P<.001). At follow-up, 7 of the 29 participants had
an ISI score ≤7 (7/29, 24%).

Treatment Adherence
We divided treatment adherence into 4 components objectively
measured by the app: (1) the number of sleep diaries filled out,
(2) the number of relaxation exercises performed, (3) the number
of conversations completed, and (4) the deviation between real
time in bed and agreed-upon time in bed (Table 6). Only 2 of
the 74 participants did not download the app. Furthermore, the
adherence data showed different adherence patterns (see
Multimedia Appendix 3). Most participants (n=35) filled out
>35 diaries, 13 participants filled out <7 diaries, and the other
24 participants filled out between 7 and 35 diaries. This pattern
follows a U-shaped curve. For the relaxation exercise, another
pattern can be distinguished. More than half of the participants
(n=41) performed a maximum of 7 relaxation exercises, of
whom 11 participants did not do any relaxation exercises at all;
7 participants did >35 relaxation exercises. For the conversations
the opposite was true: most participants (n=47) finished ≥90%
of the conversations. Only a few participants (n=4) finished
<10% of the conversations. A total of 38 participants started
and committed to the sleep restriction exercise, meaning that
they came to an agreement with the coach about their time in
bed. Participants could stay in bed for longer or for less time
than the agreement, and both situations occurred. Of these 38
participants, 32 stayed in bed for longer than agreed on for most
of the nights involving sleep restriction. When participants
stayed in bed too long it was by 67 minutes on average (SD 45);
when they shortened their time in bed it was by 42 minutes on
average (SD 29). Of the 38 participants, 26 (68%) were adherent,
meaning that their time in bed deviated by an average of <60
minutes from the agreed-upon time in bed.

Discussion
In this large-scale randomized controlled trial, we investigated
the efficacy of CBT-I delivered via a mobile phone app. The
results show that the app had moderate significant effects than
in a waitlist on the primary measures of insomnia severity
(d=–0.66, 95% CI –0.99 to –0.33) and sleep efficiency (d=0.71,
95% CI 0.37-1.04). The following secondary measures also
improved compared with the waitlist: wake after sleep onset,
number of awakenings, PSQI, depression, and anxiety. Other
measures, such as time in bed, total sleep time, and dysfunctional
beliefs about sleep did not show significant improvements,
which could be explained by the exercises included in the
treatment. The focus on modified sleep restriction in the app
could explain the lack of improvement in time in bed and total
sleep time, since sleep restriction aims at increasing sleep
efficiency, starting by decreasing time in bed and thereby also
influencing total sleep time. In addition, the app did not contain
a cognitive exercise, which could explain why we found no
difference in the dysfunctional beliefs about sleep. Nevertheless,
at posttest, 44% of the participants in the app condition had
achieved a clinically meaningful change compared with 11%
in the waitlist condition. The improvements were largely
sustained at the 3-month follow-up. The observed effects on
the primary measures are similar to those reported in a recent
meta-analysis on sleep efficiency (Hedge g=0.58) and somewhat
lower (but in the same range) than those reported for insomnia
severity (Hedge g=1.09) [16]. Note that the meta-analysis was
based on studies with various levels of human involvement,
ranging from no human support to personal contact as part of
the intervention. Earlier research indicated that human support
increases efficacy [55]. However, the effect sizes in our study
were achieved without any form of human support.
Regarding automated support, this study most closely resembles
the trials by Espie and colleagues [48] and Ritterband and
colleagues [56], which both offered automated Web-based
CBT-I. These Web-based treatments packaged the full scope
of CBT-I and demonstrated large effects. Espie and colleagues
found a Cohen d of 0.95 for sleep efficiency. Ritterband and
colleagues found a Cohen d of 1.26 for insomnia severity and
0.68 for sleep efficiency. Again, the observed effect sizes in our
study were more or less in the same range as these published
results, and our effects were achieved without including the full
CBT-I package (eg, we did not include cognitive therapy and
stimulus control). The app concentrated on sleep restriction,
and as a result the effects for sleep efficiency are more
pronounced than those for insomnia severity. The focus on sleep
restriction may also explain the absence of an effect on total
sleep time.
Zachariae and colleagues [16] found in their meta-analysis that
58.7% to 100% of the participants in the CCBT-I conditions
completed postintervention assessments, with an average of
75.3%. In our study, 61% of the participants in the app condition
completed postintervention assessment questionnaires, while
81% of the participants in the waitlist condition did so. This
difference can probably be explained by the fact that the
participants in the waitlist received the app only after they had
filled out the postintervention assessment. However, the number
of participants filling out assessments may not necessarily
correspond to the number of participants who complete

interventions. Therefore, we also report treatment adherence
numbers and adequate doses. Previously, Espie and colleagues
[48] found that 88% of their participants received an adequate
dose (≥4 sessions). Lancee and colleagues [55] found that 83%
received an adequate dose of the modules in the support
condition, and 60% in the no-support condition. In our trial,
adherence was measured for the different components, with
adherence rates ranging from 10% to 68%. Apart from the
relaxation exercise adherence (where only 10% of the
participants received an adequate dose), the other adherence
rates are comparable with the 60% found by Lancee and
colleagues [55] in their no-support condition.
In general, there exists a positive relationship between treatment
adherence and treatment outcome [50]. This relationship
suggests that this trial could have been more successful if
relaxation adherence rates would have been higher, for example.
Relaxation exercises have been noted as an effective treatment
as part of multicomponent treatment [36]. Therefore, it is likely
that higher adherence rates to the relaxation exercise would
have improved the overall efficacy of the app. However,
relaxation exercises as stand-alone treatment were inferior to
other CBT-I exercises, such as stimulus control and sleep
restriction [12]. So, as in all multicomponent treatments, it
remains unclear how adherence to specific components affected
the overall efficacy of the app. In this trial, overall adherence
rates were adequate, but there was also a considerable number
of people who did not start the modified sleep restriction
exercise at all. Beforehand, we decided that it was better to keep
people in no or a suboptimal sleep restricting schedule rather
than letting them drop out of the treatment altogether. A possible
risk of suboptimal treatments could be that people may not seek
further help after a less-successful treatment. However, this is
a general health care risk, which is not typical for eHealth or
self-help interventions. Nevertheless, the optimal tradeoff
between individual autonomy and strictness in mobile phone
app regimens has yet to be determined in future studies.
Limitations and Future Work
This study has a number of limitations that should be considered
in relation to the findings. Since the goal of the study was to
demonstrate the efficacy of the app first in a group with
insomnia disorder but without too much sleep impairment, we
used an ISI score of >7, meaning that we excluded people who
slept <5 hours as measured by a sleep diary. This exclusion
criterion may have led to a floor effect and the inclusion of
participants with relatively little room for improvement.
Although it is hard to compare studies because of different
inclusion criteria, it seems that Espie and colleagues [48] only
included participants with more severe insomnia (baseline sleep
efficiency of 55%–65%). It may be possible to achieve larger
effects in samples with higher levels of symptoms. However,
it remains the case that the efficacy of our mobile phone app
has not yet been demonstrated in a sample with severe insomnia.
Because this was one of the first times a stand-alone app has
been used to deliver CBT-I, we also excluded participants with
comorbidities such as depression. This and the issues mentioned
above limit the generalizability of our results, especially given
the high comorbidity of depression and insomnia. Now that the
app has proven its efficacy in a relatively mildly affected sample,
future research could expand the inclusion criteria (eg, severe
insomnia, depression) to study the efficacy of a CBT-I app in
a more severely affected population.
A methodological limitation was that no other Web-based or
face-to-face treatment group was included. Several other studies
have already demonstrated the efficacy of CCBT-I and CBT-I
programs. However, a similar Web-based condition could
provide insight into the added value of a mobile app. Another
related limitation is that there was no placebo control group. It
may very well be that nonspecific factors played a role in the
treatment effects of the app. Other methodological limitations
were that this study used self-report measures, and
polysomnography would be needed to confirm the objective
changes in sleep. Furthermore, the participants in this study
were a self-selected sample and may have been an unusual group
of people who were interested in solving their sleep difficulties
with self-help. A high percentage of the sample consisted of
university-educated participants, who represent only a part of
society.
Another limitation was that the app focused on sleep restriction
and relaxation. Future work should include more of the other
CBT-I components, such as cognitive exercises, and evaluate
those. Mobile phone apps provide us with the unique opportunity
to study the separate components of CBT-I in a controlled way.
Future research could focus on studying the separate
components, so that more insight can be gained into the
individual efficacy of these CBT-I components. In addition,
future research should compare the efficacy of the classical
sleep restriction versus the modified sleep restriction exercise.
Lastly, there were some technical issues during the randomized
controlled trial that made it impossible for some participants to
continue to the next conversation. The occurrence of this
problem was monitored and solved when needed. In these cases,
a new conversation was manually planned in the database for
a specific participant, and an email with instructions to update
the app was sent to that participant.
Conclusion
We are confident that this study has produced insights into the
domain of automated e-coaching apps for insomnia. These apps
provide an opportunity to investigate separate treatment
components while minimizing the influence of nonspecific
therapist factors such as therapeutic alliance. Keeping the
limitations in mind, this study demonstrated the efficacy of a
mobile phone app in the treatment of insomnia. These effects
were clinically meaningful and in the range of what is found
for Web-based treatment in general. This supports the
applicability of these kinds of technical tools in the treatment
of insomnia. Through these apps, many more people can be
offered effective insomnia treatment with probable reduced
costs. We are confident that mobile phone apps will prove to
be useful in the realm of prevention treatments; it remains to
be determined how they should best be offered: in a stand-alone
format for (prevention) treatment, or within a blended care
framework where the sleep specialist uses an app to improve
and accelerate insomnia treatment.
