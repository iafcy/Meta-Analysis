            "abstract": "Majority of the patients with pancreatic cancer present with advanced disease that is lethal and notoriously difficult to treat. Survival has not improved dramatically despite routine use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy; this situation signifies an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. The treatment of advanced disease with gemcitabine has only a modest activity on survival with a favorable impact on quality of life. So far, the current targeted agents that have been used in combination with gemcitabine have failed to improve clinical outcomes. This failure may stem from the heterogeneous molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic cancers, which involves several oncogenic pathways and defined genetic mutations. However, recent data support the evidence that the combination of gemcitabine with erlotinib, capecitabine or platinum compounds could be more active than gemcitabine alone in advanced pancreatic cancer. New therapeutic strategies, particularly using molecular target agents, are under evaluation. A number of molecular mechanisms responsible of transformation and progression of pancreatic cancer have been identified, opening the possibility to identify also possible pharmacological targets. Pancreatic cancer remains the 4th leading cause of cancer death in the U.S.A.. How to treat a non-resectable pancreatic cancer has been a challenging topic for all medical oncologists. Historical 5-fluorouracil has been replaced by single agent gemcitabine since 1997. Numerous combinations using gemcitabine as a backbone have been tested in clinical trials; unfortunately, none of the combinations including the ones with biological agents was proved to be significantly superior to gemcitabine alone. This year, more combinations were investigated and the results were presented on the meeting. In first-line setting, two large phase III trials (Abstracts #4504 and #4601) failed to prove any additional benefit of a second cytotoxic agent or a vaccine. Folinic acid plus 5-FU plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin plus irinotecan (FOLFIRI) could be considered in the second-line setting after failure of gemcitabine therapy (Abstract #4618). Novel agents (Abstracts #4501, #4625, #4626, #4617) provide some hope; however, in general, all combinations are still significantly relying on the backbone of gemcitabine. Thinking beyond the gemcitabine box and exploring novel agents are very crucial now."

            "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is an incredibly challenging disease due to its high rates of resistance to traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. There has been little improvement in the prognosis of pancreatic cancer cases in the past decades, highlighting the crucial need for more effective therapeutic approaches. Erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, and gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog, are currently used in combination for chemotherapy treatment, but new developments in drug delivery systems using liposomes and nanoparticles may be promising new modalities for management of the disease. In addition to standard chemotherapeutic drugs, these delivery systems can be utilized to deliver therapeutic agents such as siRNA, oncolytic viruses, small molecule inhibitors, antibodies, and suicide genes. Further work is required to elucidate how ligands and antibodies could be used to enhance the targeted delivery of drugs, thus increasing specificity, improving stability, and reducing the effect of the drugs on healthy tissue. Despite significant preclinical data, there are currently very few clinical trials involving pancreatic cancer targeted drug delivery. This article summarizes current developments in targeted pancreatic cancer drug delivery, focusing on delivery systems, targets, and therapeutic agents."

            "abstract": "Although 5-fluorouracil has been the most commonly prescribed chemotherapy agent in the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies, new agents discussed herein provide options for the treatment of patients with colorectal, gastric, and pancreas cancer. Irinotecan was recently approved for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer refractory to 5-fluorouracil. It has also been evaluated in chemotherapy-na√Øve patients both alone and in combination with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin or with oxaliplatin. Evaluated primarily in patients with colorectal cancer, oxaliplatin, a novel platinum compound, is an active agent. In combination with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin, oxaliplatin provides a higher response rate than 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin alone. Furthermore, when oxaliplatin was added to the same 5-fluorouracil-based regimen in which patients had disease progression, clinical activity was observed. Other agents discussed herein are raltitrexed and the oral fluorinated pyrimidines, including uracil:tegafur plus leucovorin, capecitabine, eniluracil plus oral 5-fluorouracil, and S-1. Gemcitabine has been demonstrated to be more effective than 5-fluorouracil in the alleviation of disease-specific symptoms in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine also confers a modest survival advantage. Combinations of these novel compounds are evaluated in gastrointestinal malignancies in the advanced disease setting and in adjuvant therapy programs."

Several drugs have been ascribed with the ability to provoke ICD when employed as standalone therapeutic interventions. These include various chemotherapeutics routinely employed in the clinic (e.g., doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone, bleomycin, bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and oxaliplatin) as well as some anticancer agents that are still under preclinical or clinical development (e.g., some microtubular inhibitors of the epothilone family). In addition, a few drugs are able to convert otherwise non-immunogenic instances of cell death into bona fide ICD, and may therefore be employed as chemotherapeutic adjuvants within combinatorial regimens. This is the case of cardiac glycosides, like digoxin and digitoxin, and zoledronic acid. Here, we discuss recent developments on anticancer chemotherapy based on ICD inducers."

The introduction of a new aggressive and effective chemotherapy regimen (FOLFIRINOX), interdisciplinary palliative care, and minimally invasive approaches for providing palliation are all factors that expand the role of the surgeon in the care of patients with unresectable disease. Currently, the role of the surgeon in the palliation of pancreatic cancer is (1) to identify patients with incurable disease (either preoperatively or intraoperatively), (2) to determine the optimal palliative technique to optimize results and preserve resources, and (3) to perform palliation of symptoms with low morbidity and mortality. The 3 most common symptoms of pancreatic cancer requiring surgical palliation are obstructive jaundice, gastric outlet obstruction, and tumor-associated pain. It is important that the surgeon recognizes the full range of surgical and nonoperative techniques available and contributes to the decision making as to the most appropriate method for each individual patient."

            "abstract": "Since 1996, the cornerstone of chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer has been gemcitabine, which has a genuine, but modest effect on survival and quality of life. It has been remarkably difficult to improve on these outcomes. Many phase III studies of gemcitabine doublets have been uniformly negative, with the exception of a trial of gemctabine plus erlotinib, which provided only marginal benefit. In 2010, the FOLFIRINOX regimen (bolus and infusional 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) emerged as a major treatment advance for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. In a trial with 342 patients, FOLFIRINOX yielded a longer median overall survival (11.1 vs. 6.8 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.57, p &lt; 0.001), a superior progression-free survival (6.4 vs. 3.3 months, HR 0.47, p &lt; 0.001), a higher objective response rate (31.6% vs. 9.4%, p &lt; 0.001), and a significant increase in time until definitive deterioration in quality of life, compared with gemcitabine. FOLFIRINOX is also more cost-effective than gemcitabine. Because of higher rates of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (46% vs. 21%), febrile neutropenia (5% vs. 1%), and diarrhea (13% vs. 2%) with FOLFIRINOX, vigilant patient selection, education, and monitoring are essential. Retrospective single-institution series confirm the substantial activity of FOLFIRINOX in metastatic, locally advanced, and previously-treated patients; demonstrate its safety in individuals with biliary stents; and elucidate how physicians routinely modify drug doses without clear evidence or guidelines. Ongoing and planned studies will prospectively evaluate FOLFIRINOX in the adjuvant, locally advanced, and borderline resectable settings, will add targeted agents to FOLFIRINOX, and will evaluate how to adjust doses to ameliorate toxicity."

A majority of patients are not eligible for curative resection at the time of diagnosis, and those that are resected will often relapse within the first few years after surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Until recently, the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine has been the standard of care for patients with non-resectable PDAC with only marginal effects on OS. In 2011, the gemcitabine-free FOLFIRINOX regimen (folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) showed a significant survival advantage for patients with metastatic PDAC in a phase III trial. In 2013, the Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Trial phase III trial with nano- formulated albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) in combination with gemcitabine also resulted in a significant survival extension compared to gemcitabine monotherapy.

The success of immune therapy with the anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 antibody ipilimumab in advanced melanoma has spurred interest in the development of vaccines and immune therapies for other solid tumors. Certainly, the concept of harnessing the power of the immune system for cancer treatment is an attractive concept to patients and clinicians alike.

Despite considerable advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the carcinogenesis of PDAC, the outcome of the disease was not significantly improved over the last 20 years. Although some achievements in molecular-targeted therapies have been made (that is, targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor by erlotinib), which already entered clinical settings, and despite the promising outcome of the FOLFIRINOX trial, there is an urgent need for improvement of the chemotherapy in this disease. A plethora of molecular alterations are thought to be responsible for the profound chemoresistance, including mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Besides these classical hallmarks of cancer, the constitutive or inducible activity of transcription factor pathways are characteristic changes in PDAC. Recently, three transcription factors-nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2)-have been shown to be crucial for tumor development and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer. These transcription factors are key regulators of a variety of genes involved in nearly all aspects of tumorigenesis and resistance against chemotherapeutics and death receptor ligands. Furthermore, the pathways of NF-Œ∫B, NFAT and Nrf2 are functional, interacting on several regulatory steps, and, especially, natural compounds such as curcumin interfere with more than one pathway. Thus, targeting these pathways by established inhibitors or new drugs might have great potential to improve the outcome of PDAC patients, most likely in combination with established anticancer drugs. In this article, we summarize recent progress in the characterization of these transcription-factor pathways and their role in PDAC and therapy resistance.

            "abstract": "In a dozen years of development, irinotecan (CPT11) became one of major therapeutics in the taking care of the metastatic colorectal cancer (CCRM). First used in monotherapy every three weeks, irinotecan has been later developed in association with 5FU and folinic acid according to two modalities of administration (bolus schedule administred weekly or infused schedule every two weeks). This association is now validated both in first and second line. Infused schedule (Folfiri) seems to introduce the best ratio of efficacy/tolerance. The association with the anti VEGF antibody (Avastin), bevacizumab) is promising. Moreover the association of the irinotecan with the anti EGFR antibody (Erbitux)), cetixumab) has show a efficacy in third line after progression under an protocol with irinotecan. Combinations with oxaliplatine (Irox, Irinox) or (Folfoxiri, Folfirinox) still remain in the course of appreciation notably in neoadjuvant context. An increment of dose seems accomplishable in monotherapy or in combination with/AF (high Folfiri doses) with a notable increment of responses rates. Nevertheless this strategy must again show a true clinical interest. Finally they are at promising developments in the fields of the irinotecan pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic."

            "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive cancers, and the decline in mortality observed in most other cancer diseases, has so far not taken place in pancreatic cancer. Complete tumor resection is a requirement for potential cure, and the reorganization of care in the direction of high patient-volume centers, offering multimodal treatment, has improved survival and Quality of Life. Also the rates and severity grade of complications are improving in high-volume pancreatic centers. One of the major problems worldwide is underutilization of surgery in resectable pancreatic cancer. Suboptimal investigation, follow up and oncological treatment outside specialized centers are additional key problems. New chemotherapeutic regimens like FOLFIRINOX have improved survival in patients with metastatic disease, and different adjuvant treatment options result in well documented survival benefit. Neoadjuvant treatment is highly relevant, but needs further evaluation. Also adjuvant immunotherapy, in the form of vaccination with synthetic K-Ras-peptides, has been shown to produce long term immunological memory in cytotoxic T-cells in long term survivors. Improvement in clinical outcome is already achievable and further progress is expected in the near future for patients treated with curative as well as palliative intention."

In recent years, there have been some breakthroughs in the deadlock: three regimens, namely gemcitabine-erlotinib, FOLFIRINOX, and gemcitabine-nab-paclitaxel, have been shown to prolong the overall survival of patients when compared with gemcitabine monotherapy. In addition, emerging data suggested that the membrane protein human equilibrative nucleotide transporter 1 is a potential biomarker with which to predict the efficacy of gemcitabine.

R0 resection of the tumor is to date the only potentially curative approach, but less than 20% of patients are eligible for a curative surgery at diagnosis.

In order to improve patients' outcome many trials have, during the last 10 years, explored the pharmacokinetic modulation of gemcitabine and combination therapies with gemcitabine and other anti-cancer agents with consistent negative results. It is finally a trial assessing the efficacy of a combination chemotherapy without gemcitabine: the FOLFIRINOX regimen, reported this year, that has shown for the first time a significant improvement in progression free and overall survivals. In parallel, many trials testing new targeted agents in these patients are currently ongoing.

            "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most deadly cancers because of a lack of early diagnostic markers and efficient therapeutics. The fluorinated analog of deoxycytidine, gemcitabine and emerging FOLFIRINOX protocol (5-fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan/SN-38, oxaliplatin and leucovorin) are the main chemotherapies to treat PDAC. The ErbB2/HER2 oncogenic receptor is commonly overexpressed in PDAC. In this context, we aimed to decipher the ErbB2-mediated mechanisms of chemoresistance to the two main chemotherapy protocols used to treat PDAC.ErbB2 knocking down (KD) in CAPAN-1 and CAPAN-2 cells led to an increased sensitivity to gemcitabine and an increased resistance to irinotecan/SN-38 both in vitro and in vivo (subcutaneous xenografts) This was correlated to an increase of hCNT1 and hCNT3 transporters and ABCG2, MRP1 and MRP2 ATP-binding cassette transporters expression and resistance to cell death. We also show that MRP2 is repressed following activation of JNK, Erk1/2 and NF-Œ∫B pathways by ErbB2. Finally, in datasets of human PDAC samples, ErbB2 and MRP2 expression was conversely correlated. Altogether, we propose that ErbB2 mediates several intracellular mechanisms linked to PDAC cell chemoresistance that may represent potential targets in order to ameliorate chemotherapy response and allow stratification of patients eligible for either gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX treatment."

The current treatment modalities rely on a variety of DNA damaging agents including gemcitabine, FOLFIRINOX, and Abraxane that activate cell cycle checkpoints, which allows cells to survive these drug treaments. Indeed, these treatment regimens have only extended patient survival by a few months. The complex microenvironment of PCa tumors has been shown to complicate drug delivery thus decreasing the sensitivity of PCa tumors to chemotherapy. In this study, a genome-wide siRNA library was used to conduct a synthetic lethal screen of Panc1 cells that was treated with gemcitabine. A sublethal dose (50 nM) of the drug was used to model situations of limiting drug availability to PCa tumors in vivo. Twenty-seven validated sensitizer genes were identified from the screen including the Vitamin D receptor (VDR). Gemcitabine sensitivity was shown to be VDR dependent in multiple PCa cell lines in clonogenic survival assays. Sensitization was not achieved through checkpoint override but rather through disrupting DNA repair. VDR knockdown disrupted the cells' ability to form phospho-Œ≥H2AX and Rad51 foci in response to gemcitabine treatment. Disruption of Rad51 foci formation, which compromises homologous recombination, was consistent with increased sensitivity of PCa cells to the PARP inhibitor Rucaparib. Thus inhibition of VDR in PCa cells provides a new way to enhance the efficacy of genotoxic drugs."

            "abstract": "In 2010, the FOLFIRINOX regimen (bolus and infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) emerged as a new option in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and a good performance status. However, at that time, some doubts were raised regarding safety issues. Similarly, no data on FOLFIRINOX were published in patients with unresectable/locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. This article presents the available experience with FOLFIRINOX outside clinical trials in metastatic and locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients. The safety of the regimen in patients with biliary stents and in previously treated patients is also described. FOLFIRINOX usage in clinical practice, including modification of the regimen (omission of bolus 5-fluorouracil; FOLFOXIRI regimen), is also presented. These data suggest that a phase III randomized study is warranted to further explore the role of FOLFIRINOX in locally advanced pancreatic cancer."

            "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth cause of cancer death in Western countries, the only chance for long term survival is an R0 surgical resection that is feasible in about 10%-20% of all cases. Five years cumulative survival is less than 5% and rises to 25% for radically resected patients. About 40% has locally advanced in PC either borderline resectable (BRPC) or unresectable locally advanced (LAPC). Since LAPC and BRPC have been recognized as a particular form of PC neoadjuvant therapy (NT) has increasingly became a valid treatment option. The aim of NT is to reach local control of disease but, also, it is recognized to convert about 40% of LAPC patients to R0 resectability, thus providing a significant improvement of prognosis for responding patients. Once R0 resection is achieved, survival is comparable to that of early stage PCs treated by upfront surgery. Thus it is crucial to look for a proper patient selection. Neoadjuvant strategies are multiples and include neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT), and the association of nCT with radiotherapy (nCRT) given as either a combination of a radio sensitizing drug as gemcitabine or capecitabine or and concomitant irradiation or as upfront nCT followed by nRT associated to a radio sensitizing drug. This latter seem to be most promising as it may select patients who do not go on disease progression during initial treatment and seem to have a better prognosis. The clinical relevance of nCRT may be enhanced by the application of higher active protocols as FOLFIRINOX."

            "abstract": "FOLFIRINOX is a highly active regimen for the treatment of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. However, treatment with FOLFIRINOX is associated with relevant toxicity and predictors for response to therapy are warranted. We retrospectively analyzed 49 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX in order to evaluate a possible predictive role of clinical parameters and tumor characteristics for response to chemotherapy. Tumor samples were characterized histopathologically before treatment and expression of p53 and Ki67 was analyzed using automated immunohistochemistry. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The overall objective response rate was 55.1%, the disease control rate was 70.6%. Female gender was associated with a significantly higher disease control rate of 91.7 compared to 48.0% in male patients (p=0.001) which reached 100% in female patients when primarily treated compared to treatment after surgical resection and relapse (77.8%, p=0.057). For all patients median PFS was 3.5 months (95% CI, 2.7-4.3 months) and median OS was 13 months (95% CI, 9.4-16.6 months). Female patients showed a tendency towards a longer median PFS (5.0 months, 95% CI, 3.6-6.4 months) compared to males (3.0 months, 95% CI, 2.4-3.6 months) (p=0.099). Serum levels of CA19.9 and CEA were significantly higher in female patients compared to male patients (p=0.037, p=0.05). Tumors of patients with response to FOLFIRINOX showed a higher expression level of p53 and Ki67 as well as higher serum levels of CA19.9 compared to non-responders, which was statistically not significant. Our study indicates that female gender is a positive predictor for therapy response to FOLFIRINOX in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Female gender in turn was associated with increased levels of tumor markers CEA and CA19.9 and patients with higher serum levels of CA19.9 were more responsive to FOLFIRINOX."

            "abstract": "Irinotecan is a camptothecin analog used worldwide for a broad range of solid tumors, including colorectal and lung cancers. It can cause severe adverse drug reactions, such as neutropenia or diarrhea. Irinotecan is metabolized to form active SN-38, which is further conjugated and detoxified by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 enzyme. Recent pharmacogenetic studies on irinotecan have revealed the impact of UGT1A1 polymorphisms on severe adverse effects. A variant in the promoter of the UGT1A1 gene, the UGT1A1 *28 allele, has been extensively studied, and pharmacogenetic relationships between the variant and severe toxicities of irinotecan have been reported. The US FDA and pharmaceutical companies revised the irinotecan label in 2005, and it now includes homozygosity for the UGT1A1*28 genotype as one of the risk factors for severe neutropenia. A variant in exon 1 of the UGT1A1 gene, the UGT1A1*6 allele, mainly found in East Asians, is also an important risk factor associated with severe neutropenia. The concurrence of UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6, even when heterozygous, markedly alters the disposition of irinotecan, potentially increasing toxicity, which is now written on the label of irinotecan in Japan. For patients showing homozygosity for UGT1A1*28, *6, or compound heterozygosity for UGT1A1*6 and *28, dose reduction of irinotecan is strongly recommended. Genotyping tests for UGT1A1 *6 and *28 have been approved in Japan and are currently used in oncology practice. Moreover, a recent Phase 2 trial for FOLFIRINOX in Japan excluded patients who showed homozygosity for UGT1A1*28, *6, or compound heterozygosity for UGT1A1*6 and *28. At present, irinotecan chemotherapy based on a patient's UGT1A1 genetic status is scientifically reasonable."

            "abstract": "Neoadjuvant therapy is increasingly becoming a valid treatment option for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). In borderline resectable disease, neoadjuvant therapy is employed to improve the probability of margin-clear resections. In non-metastatic, non-resectable pancreatic cancer, treatment primarily aims to induce disease control, but may achieve conversion to surgical resectability in some patients. Several treatment modalities including chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or the sequential use of both have been investigated in numerous, mostly small and non-randomized studies. Nevertheless, there is a consistent finding that neoadjuvant therapy can induce resectability in up to 30%-40% of LAPC patients. Once resection has been achieved, overall survival appears to be comparable to that observed for primarily resectable patients. Thus, patient selection evolves as an important aspect of neoadjuvant therapy; retrospective analyses identified induction chemotherapy as an appropriate tool to define LAPC patients who may benefit most from subsequent treatment with CRT. The clinical importance of induction chemotherapy may further increase once highly active protocols such as the FOLFIRINOX or the gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel regimen are introduced into novel multimodality treatment concepts."

While patients with pancreatic cancer have traditionally faced a dismal prognosis, over the past several years various advances in diagnosis and treatment have begun to positively impact this disease. Identification of effective combinations of existing chemotherapeutic agents, such as the FOLFIRINOX and the gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel regimen, has improved survival for selected patients although concerns regarding their toxicity profiles remain. A better understanding of pancreatic carcinogenesis has identified several pre-malignant precursor lesions, such as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, and cystic neoplasms. Imaging technology has also evolved dramatically so as to allow early detection of these lesions and thereby facilitate earlier management. Surgery remains a cornerstone of treatment for patients with resectable pancreatic tumors, and advances in surgical technique have allowed patients to undergo resection with decreasing perioperative morbidity and mortality. Surgery has also become feasible in selected patients with borderline resectable tumors as a result of neoadjuvant therapy. Furthermore, pancreatectomy involving vascular reconstruction and pancreatectomy with minimally invasive techniques have demonstrated safety without significantly compromising oncologic outcomes. Lastly, a deeper understanding of molecular aberrations contributing to the development of pancreatic cancer shows promise for future development of more targeted and safe therapeutic agents."

Twenty-nine patients received dose attenuations with the first cycle. Median relative doses of irinotecan and bolus fluorouracil were less than those reported by Conroy (64 vs. 81 % and 66 vs. 82 %, respectively).

Treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas not only involves chemotherapy and targeted therapy, but also requires attention to accompanying comorbidities as well as frequently intensive supportive treatment and psychosocial support. Gemcitabine-based combinations with fluoropyrimidines and platin analogs have essentially failed to provide a substantial prolongation of survival and may constitute a treatment option only in patients with a good performance status. Among targeted therapies, only the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib has shown activity which is marginal in the overall population, but clinically relevant in patients developing skin rash. New avenues of polychemotherapy are presently explored since the gemcitabine-free FOLFIRINOX-regimen (infusional 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid plus irinotecan and oxaliplatin) was shown to be markedly superior to gemcitabine in selected good-performance patients. Pancreatic cancer is notably characterized as a hypovascular tumor rich in desmoplastic stromal tissue. An innovative approach to treatment therefore focuses on peritumoral fibroblasts and aims to induce a depletion of the stroma either by inhibition of the hedgehog pathway or by targeting SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) via application of albumin-bound paclitaxel."

These numbers continue to grow, and it was recently predicted that, within decades, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma will become the second most lethal cancer in this country. Beyond conventional oncologic-based therapies, researchers are working hard, albeit with increasingly limited federal support, to develop multiple novel therapeutic options focusing primarily on targeting specific, disrupted core signaling pathways within pancreatic cancer cells. In line with the history of medical oncology and medical paradigms, many pharmaceutical companies and large academic institutions have been focused on searching for compounds (biologic and chemicals) in an effort to find that unique \"magic bullet\" that will extend pancreatic cancer patients' lives (e.g., K-ras inhibitors). This magic bullet has been difficult to find in a haystack full of molecular pathways and mutated genes because the challenge is defined by identifying a therapeutic window that kills the tumor, yet spares the host. This therapeutic window has been hard to discover in the backdrop of the heterogeneous cell populations that make up a pancreatic tumor together with a heterogeneous patient population that has multiple, undefined tumor subtypes. Thus, to date, efforts have had limited success. Perhaps the best recent example of limited success is the discovery of the classic combination of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX), extending life by only 4 months when compared with gemcitabine (note that this drug combination does not directly target one single pathway or pancreatic cancer subtype)."

            "abstract": "In the past 15 years, we have seen few therapeutic advances for patients with pancreatic cancer, which is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Currently, only about 6% of patients with advanced disease respond to standard gemcitabine therapy, and median survival is only about 6 mo. Moreover, phase III trials have shown that adding various cytotoxic and targeted chemotherapeutic agents to gemcitabine has failed to improve overall survival, except in cases in which gemcitabine combined with erlotinib show minimal survival benefit. Several meta-analyses have shown that the combination of gemcitabine with either a platinum analog or capecitabine may lead to clinically relevant survival prolongation, especially for patients with good performance status. Meanwhile, many studies have focused on the pharmacokinetic modulation of gemcitabine by fixed-dose administration, and metabolic or transport enzymes related to the response and toxicity of gemcitabine. Strikingly, a phase III trial in 2010 showed that, in comparison to gemcitabine alone, the FOLFIRINOX regimen in patients with advanced disease and good performance status, produced better median overall survival, median progression-free survival, and objective response rates. This regimen also resulted in greater, albeit manageable toxicity."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Radiation recall refers to chemotherapy-triggered inflammation in healthy areas previously exposed to irradiation. Chemotherapeutics known to be associated with radiation recall phenomenon include anthracyclines, taxanes and antimetabolites, such as gemcitabine and capecitabine. Case reports detailing radiation recall dermatitis and pneumonitis associated with erlotinib have been previously described in the literature, however, there are no reported cases describing radiation gastritis associated with erlotinib. We report a patient with pancreatic cancer who developed gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to radiation recall gastritis related to erlotinib exposure.\n    \n\n\n          Case report:\n        \n      \n      A 57-year-old Hispanic male with pancreatic cancer initially received 7 cycles of FOLFIRINOX followed by capecitabine with radiation therapy for 28 fractions for a total of 5,040 cGy. Re-staging with computed tomography demonstrated stable disease. The patient was then treated with erlotinib and capecitabine for approximately two months before restaging demonstrated progressive disease. Shortly after discontinuing erlotinib and capecitabine, the patient reported maroon colored stools. Laboratory studies demonstrated a precipitous drop in hemoglobin and hematocrit from pre-treatment baseline, ultimately requiring transfusion with packed red blood cells. Subsequent esophagogastroduodenoscopy demonstrated findings consistent with radiation gastritis, with oozing in the gastric body and antrum, which was treated therapeutically with argon plasma coagulation. The patient's gastrointestinal bleed was difficult to control. Over the course of a two-month period - the patient required multiple admissions, repeat therapeutic esophagogastroduodenoscopies and transfusions.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Radiation recall from erlotinib is rare but can potentially arise in any site that has been previously irradiated. There may be an association between the pathogenesis of radiation recall and erlotinib's up-regulation of the angiogenic growth factor thymidine phosphorylase. Treating physicians are reminded of the potential toxicity from erlotinib either given concomitantly or followed by radiation. We suggest discontinuing erlotinib if radiation gastritis is observed. We encourage physicians with similar experiences with erlotinib to report their findings. Further studies are warranted to investigate the pathogenesis of this unique phenomenon and its association with erlotinib."

It is possible that, in practice, some patients receive insufficient doses of irinotecan. Dose escalation could be considered in carefully selected patients: young patients with a good performance status and normal liver function. This approach could be useful in patients with liver metastases, which may become resectable in the case of a major tumour response. It is wise to perform UGT1A1 genotyping prior to dose escalation to detect patients at high risk of toxicity (genotype 7/7). The role of another laboratory parameter, which needs to be evaluated is the KRAS status of the tumour. A KRAS mutation confers resistance to cetuximab, which reduces treatment options, especially in first-line. However, in the CRYSTAL trial comparing FOLFIRI to FOLFIRI-cetuximab as first-line therapy, the presence of a KRAS mutation did not appear to influence the efficacy of FOLFIRI.

The only chance for cure or longer survival is surgical resection; however, only 10% to 20% of patients have resectable disease. Although surgical techniques have improved, most who undergo complete resection experience a recurrence. Adjuvant systemic therapy reduces the recurrence rate and improves outcomes. There is a potential role for radiation therapy as part of treatment for locally advanced disease, although its use in both the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings remains controversial. Palliative systemic treatment is the only option for patients with metastatic disease. To date, however, only the gemcitabine plus erlotinib combination, and recently the FOLFIRINOX regimen, have been associated with relatively small but statistically significant improvements in OS when compared directly with gemcitabine alone. Although several meta-analyses have suggested a benefit associated with combination chemotherapy, whether this benefit is clinically meaningful remains unclear, particularly in light of the enhanced toxicity associated with combination regimens. There is growing evidence that the exceptionally poor prognosis in PC is caused by the tumor's characteristic abundant desmoplastic stroma that plays a critical role in tumor cell growth, invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Carefully designed clinical trials that include translational analysis will provide a better understanding of the tumor biology and its relation to the host stromal cells. Future directions will involve testing of new targeted agents, understanding the pharmacodynamics of our current targeted agents, searching for predictive and prognostic biomarkers, and exploring the efficacy of different combinations strategies."

The median progression free survival for gemcitabine based treatment was 2.9 months (IQR=1.6-5.6) as opposed to 7.3 months (IQR=4.5-9.2) for FOLFIRINOX (P=0.02). Median overall survival was 4.9 months (IQR=2.3-9.5) for first line gemcitabine based treatment and 10.5 months (IQR=7.0-13.2) for first line FOLFIRINOX therapy (P=0.002). Patients on FOLFIRINOX had better survival across all subgroups. Inpatient admissions and dose reductions were more frequent with FOLFIRINOX but the difference between the two regimens was not statistically significant. FOLFIRINOX could be successfully administered as outpatient therapy to a number of patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      FOLFIRINOX remains a suitable first line option in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with good performance status even in a resource-poor country where diagnostic and supportive care facilities may be less than optimal and cost is a limitation."

An IRB-approved analysis was performed of all BRPC and LAPC patients treated with our departmental treatment protocol. After staging, medically fit patients underwent chemotherapy for 2-3 months, with regimen at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist. Patients then received SBRT delivered in five consecutive daily fractions with median total radiation doses of 30 Gy to tumor and 40 Gy dose painted to tumor-vessel interfaces. This was followed by restaging imaging for possible resection. Overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS), and locoregional control (LRC) rates were estimated and compared by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 159 patients, 110 BRPC and 49 LAPC, with 14.0 months median overall follow-up.

Despite 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin with irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel significantly improving outcomes for metastatic cancer, refractory disease still poses significant challenges. Difficulties with early detection and the inherent chemo- and radio-resistant nature of this malignancy led to attempts to define the sequential biology of pancreatic cancer in order to improve survival outcomes. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is characterized by several germline or acquired genetic mutations, the most common being KRAS (90%), CDK2NA (90%), TP53 (75%-90%), DPC4/SMAD4 (50%). In addition, the tumor microenvironment, chemoresistant cancer stem cells, and the desmoplastic stroma have been the target of some promising clinical investigations. Among the core pathways reproducibly shown to lead the development and progression of this disease, DNA repair, apoptosis, G1/S cell cycle transition, KRAS, Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog, TGF-beta, and other cell invasion pathways, have been the target of \"precision therapeutics\". No single molecularly targeted therapeutic though has been uniformly successful, probably due to the tumor heterogeneity, but biomarker research is evolving and it hopes to select more patients likely to benefit. Recent reports note activity with immunotherapies such as CD40 agonists, CCR2 inhibitors, cancer vaccines, and novel combinations against the immunosuppressive tumor milieu are ongoing. While many obstacles still exist, clearly we are making progress in deciphering the heterogeneity within pancreatic cancers. Integrating conventional and immunological targeting will be the key to effective treatment of this deadly disease."

It is clear that to really make an impact on this disease, it will be necessary to address three different problems with targeted therapeutics.

On the other hand, legitimate concerns have been raised about nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery because of its potential cytotoxicity. Therefore, we explored the local delivery of a reduced dosage of FOLFIRINOX, a four-drug regimen comprising oxaliplatin, leucovorin, irinotecan, and fluorouracil, for pancreatic cancer using a biocompatible drug-eluting scaffold as a novel chemotherapy strategy after palliative surgery. In vitro assays showed that FOLFIRINOX in the scaffold caused massive apoptosis and thereby a decrease in the viability of pancreatic cancer cells, confirming the chemotherapeutic capability of the drug-eluting scaffold. In vivo studies in an orthotopic murine xenograft model demonstrated that the FOLFIRINOX in the scaffold had antitumorigenic and antimetastatic effects comparable with those achieved by intraperitoneal injection, despite the dose released by the scaffold being roughly two thirds lower. A mechanistic study attributed our results to the excellent ability of the FOLFIRINOX in the scaffold to destroy the CD133(+)CXCR4(+) cell population responsible for pancreatic tumorigenesis and metastasis. This clinically oriented study gives rise to a promising alternative strategy for postsurgical management of pancreatic cancer, featuring a local chemotherapeutic effect with considerable attenuation of side effects."

Although the triplet combination FOLFIRINOX improves outcomes for patients with metastatic disease, it is compounded by significant toxicity, and novel regimens, rationally designed and based on thorough mechanistic activity on the tumor targets, are clearly needed. Solvent-based taxanes, docetaxel and paclitaxel, have little activity as single agents, but combinations with fluoropyrimidines and gemcitabine show efficacy, albeit they have not undergone testing in phase III trials. Pancreatic cancer is characterized by an abundant desmoplastic, fibroinflammatory and hypoperfused stroma, which has been blamed for its overall chemoresistance. Nanoparticle bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) has been pharmacologically designed as a novel water-soluble agent, with improved therapeutic index compared with the cremophor-based formulation, capable of achieving higher systemic exposure. In preclinical systems, when combined with gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel increased intratumoral gemcitabine delivery, possibly due to inducing stromal 'collapse' and through inhibition of the gemcitabine-catabolizing enzyme cytidine deaminase. Most recently, the combination of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine demonstrated significant survival benefit with good tolerability in metastatic pancreatic cancer in the phase III trial MPACT, and now represents one of the gold-standard regimens for this disease. Although taxanes are overall potent chemotherapeutics for various cancers, it is clear that for meaningful results in pancreatic adenocarcinomas, rationally designed combinations and novel technologies for drug delivery are likely to be most successful."

            "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer remains a major therapeutic challenge in 2007. Most patients with advanced pancreatic cancer experience pain and must limit their daily activities because of tumor-related symptoms. Single-agent gemcitabine remains the standard treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer , which has shown improvement in disease-related symptoms and a modest benefit in survival. Recent phase III trials using gemcitabine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents have failed to show improvements in survival, although the gemcitabine/oxaliplatin and gemcitabine/capecitabine combinations have shown some promise. The combination of gemcitabine with erlotinib, though showed a statistically significant prolongation of survival, may not be clinically significant. Encouraging results in two separate phase II trials of gemcitabine in combination with bevacizumab and cetuximab respectively led to two major randomized comparative trials of the combination (Cancer and Leukemia Group B, CALGB 80303; Southwest Oncology Group, SWOG S0205). The results of these studies presented at the 43rd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, Chicago, IL, USA (June 1-5, 2007) showed no benefit of the combination. 'How can we change this bleak landscape?'. Probably by truly targeting our therapy with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) agents as well as other biologic agents by identifying those patients who are most likely to derive benefit and achieve meaningful responses. This is particularly crucial in a disease such as pancreatic cancer that has such a short life expectancy that the 'window' for any given treatment may be quite small. Consequently, further study should include the development of more predictive assays and improved exploitation of surrogate biomarkers of response. We need to study locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients separate from advanced pancreatic cancer patients. Role of multiple-targeted agents is also warranted. It's also time to investigate gemcitabine-free regimens. Two recent studies presented at ASCO showed that irinotecan/docetaxel or FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) can offer comparable results to gemcitabine when used as first-line treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer.

            "abstract": "Borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma represents a subset of localized cancers that are at high risk for a margin-positive resection and early treatment failure when resected de novo. Although several different anatomic definitions for this disease stage exist, there is agreement that some degree of reconstructible mesenteric vessel involvement by the tumor is the critical anatomic feature that positions borderline resectable between anatomically resectable and unresectable (locally advanced) tumors in the spectrum of localized disease. Consensus also exists that such cancers should be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or chemoradiation before resection; although the optimal algorithm is unknown, systemic chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation is a rational approach. Although gemcitabine-based systemic chemotherapy with either 5-FU or gemcitabine-based chemoradiation regimens has been used to date, newer regimens, including FOLFIRINOX, should be evaluated on protocol. Delivery of neoadjuvant therapy necessitates durable biliary decompression for as many as 6 months in many patients with cancers of the pancreatic head. Patients with no evidence of metastatic disease following neoadjuvant therapy should be brought to the operating room for pancreatectomy, at which time resection of the superior mesenteric/portal vein and/or hepatic artery should be performed when necessary to achieve a margin-negative resection. Following completion of multimodality therapy, patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer can expect a duration of survival as favorable as that of patients who initially present with resectable tumors. Coordination among a multidisciplinary team of physicians is necessary to maximize these complex patients' short- and long-term oncologic outcomes."

In patients with unresectable tumor there are several strategies of palliative chemotherapy, either gemcitabine based regimens or FOLFIRINOX, which is supposed to be most efficient but also most toxic. Hence, management of toxicity is crucial to perform a therapy consisting of FOLFIRINOX.\n    \n\n\n          Case report:\n        \n      \n      We report on a 69-year-old female patient suffering from adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic tail with multiple liver metastases. Palliative chemotherapy comprising leucovorin, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan (FOLFIRINOX) was initiated in February 2011 and was tolerated very well. Subsequent computed tomography-scans showed significant reduction of the tumor load in the liver as well as in the primary pancreatic tumor. The serum levels of the tumor marker CA 19-9 were elevated initially and decreased concomitantly. Thus, chemotherapy was continued for more than 3 years, and up to 72 cycles were administered until April 2014. Due to intermittent neutropenia and mucositis the initial dose was reduced to 60% of the calculated standard dose. In April 2014, an intermediate staging by computed tomography and FDG-PET revealed significant reduction of the size of the primary pancreatic tumor compared with February 2011. Liver metastases could hardly be detected anymore. After pausing chemotherapy for 12 weeks, one liver metastasis reappeared and was treated by RFA in August 2014. Meanwhile, in October 2014 there is no radiological evidence on any existing tumor or metastasis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our report demonstrates that a sufficient tolerance of chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX is achievable, what makes a long term treatment with FOLFIRINOX feasible and can lead to impressive results."

            "abstract": "The vast majority of patients with pancreatic cancer present with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic disease, and in this setting only a palliative treatment can be offered. Single-agent gemcitabine has been considered the standard chemotherapy for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer since the results of a pivotal phase III trial showing superior clinical benefit compared to bolus 5-fluorouracil were published in 1997. In recent years, many randomized trials have attempted to improve results obtained with gemcitabine exploring a different schedule (fixed dose rate) of its administration, or testing the addition of one or more drugs to gemcitabine. Unfortunately, none of these trials produced a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in overall survival compared to the standard. A randomized phase III trial has recently shown a survival advantage using a combination of more drugs (FOLFIRINOX: irinotecan, oxaliplatin, folinic acid and 5-fluorouracil) compared to single-agent gemcitabine, suggesting that regimens without gemcitabine can be successfully used in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. FOLFIRINOX was associated with worse toxicity than gemcitabine, and the available data suggest that this regimen may be considered for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who are fit enough to withstand potential side effects. The best option for these patients remains the enrolment in prospective clinical trials. Improvements in the treatment of the advanced disease will possibly derive from new combinations or from new drugs, but certainly from a better knowledge of the multiple molecular pathways implicated in pancreatic carcinogenesis and in invasion and metastasis."

For more than a decade, gemcitabine (Gem) has been the mainstay of first-line PDAC treatment. Many efforts aimed at improving single-agent Gem efficacy by either combining it with a second cytotoxic/molecularly targeted agent or pharmacokinetic modulation provided disappointing results. Recently, the field of systemic therapy of advanced PDAC is finally moving forward. Polychemotherapy has shown promise over single-agent Gem: regimens like PEFG-PEXG-PDXG and GTX provide significant potential advantages in terms of survival and/or disease control, although sometimes at the cost of poor tolerability. The PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 was the first phase III trial to provide unequivocal benefit using the polychemotherapy regimen FOLFIRINOX; however the less favorable safety profile and the characteristics of the enrolled population, restrict the use of FOLFIRINOX to young and fit PDAC patients. The nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-Paclitaxel) formulation was developed to overcome resistance due to the desmoplastic stroma surrounding pancreatic cancer cells. Regardless of whether or not this is its main mechanisms of action, the combination of nab-Paclitaxel plus Gem showed a statistically and clinically significant survival advantage over single agent Gem and significantly improved all the secondary endpoints. Furthermore, recent findings on maintenance therapy are opening up potential new avenues in the treatment of advanced PDAC, particularly in a new era in which highly effective first-line regimens allow patients to experience prolonged disease control. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in the systemic treatment of advanced PDAC, mostly focusing on recent findings that have set new standards in metastatic disease. Potential avenues for further development in the metastatic setting and current efforts to integrate new effective chemotherapy regimens in earlier stages of disease (neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and multimodal approaches in both resectable and unresectable patients) are also briefly discussed."

Gemcitabine, with or without erlotinib, has been the standard chemotherapy in this setting but the benefit is only modest.

            "abstract": "Gemcitabine chemotherapy has been the standard for advanced pancreatic cancer for more than a decade. New oral fluoropyrimidines such as S-1 and capecitabine are other key drugs. Gemcitabine plus erlotinib was the only combination therapy that significantly prolonged survival, although the effect was minimal. Little or no improvement in survival with recent molecular-targeted drugs might be attributed to the very high incidence of K-ras gene mutation in pancreatic cancer. Recently, the non-gemcitabine-based-regimen of FOLFIRINOX showed significantly greater overall survival compared with gemcitabine for the first time. For biliary tract cancer, gemcitabine plus cisplatin combination chemotherapy has been proved to significantly prolong survival and will become the standard therapy. Further improvement in survival is expected by the addition of cetuximab."

This case report describes two patients with an initial diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic cancer, both with hepatic metastases and one with an additional peritoneal carcinomatosis. Initially, both patients were treated intravenously with the FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy regimen, consisting of 5-FU, folinic acid, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. Surprisingly, the FOLFIRINOX treatment resulted in complete resolution of the hepatic metastases in both patients, with no lesions detectable by computed tomography scan. Furthermore, treatment response included decreased diameter of the primary tumor in the tail of the pancreas and disappearance of the additional peritoneal carcinomatosis. Both patients were discussed by our multidisciplinary tumor board, which recommended surgical resections of the carcinoma. The R0 resection of the primary tumor was successful in both cases and, interestingly, the resected tissues showed no evidence of the hepatic metastases intraoperatively. In the first case, the patient received a postoperative 6-mo course of adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine. In the second case, the patient continued to receive the FOLFIRINOX regimen for an additional 6 mo postoperatively. At 12 mo after the operation, a nonresectable retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis was detected in the first patient, whereas the second patient remained in complete remission at the time of this report (5 mo after the adjuvant therapy was discontinued). This case report is the first of its kind to describe two cases of hepatic metastatic pancreatic carcinoma that were resectable following treatment with FOLFIRINOX. Further studies are required to examine the role of FOLFIRINOX as a neoadjuvant treatment option in subgroups of patients with initially metastasized pancreatic carcinoma."

Consequently, our knowledge on the appropriate medical treatment of this patient group is limited. In a meeting of German medical oncology experts, the available clinical evidence and own clinical experience regarding the management of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and hyperbilirubinaemia was discussed. The present publication summarises the discussion outcomes with regard to appropriate management of these patients, including consensus-based recommendations for nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine treatment, according to the best available evidence. In summary, knowledge of the underlying aetiology of hyperbilirubinaemia and the metabolisation routes of the cytotoxic drugs is crucial before initiating chemotherapy. As effective treatment options should also be made available to patients with comorbid conditions, including hyperbilirubinaemia, the experts provide advice for an initial dose reduction of chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine based on the total bilirubin level in patients with biliary obstruction or extensive liver metastasis."

The low survival rates associated with PDAC primarily reflect the fact that tumours progress rapidly with few specific symptoms and are thus at an advanced stage at diagnosis in most patients. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop accurate markers of pre-invasive pancreatic neoplasms in order to facilitate prediction of cancer risk and to help diagnose the disease at an earlier stage. However, screening for early diagnosis of prostate cancer remains challenging and identifying a highly accurate, low-cost screening test for early PDAC for use in clinical practice remains an important unmet need. More effective therapies are also crucial in PDAC, since progress in identifying novel therapies has been hampered by the genetic complexity of the disease and treatment remains a major challenge. Presently, the greatest step towards improved treatment efficacy has been made in the field of palliative chemotherapy by introducing FOLFIRINOX (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. Strategies designed to raise the profile of PDAC in research and clinical practice are a further requirement in order to ensure the best treatment for patients. This article proposes a number of approaches that may help to accelerate progress in treating patients with PDAC, which, in turn, may be expected to improve the quality of life and survival for those suffering from this devastating disease."

One of the hallmarks of PDAC is the presence of an extensive desmoplastic reaction consisting of pancreatic stellate cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, vasculature, and extracellular matrix. The complex interaction between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment in PDAC is beginning to be understood, and the disruption of these interactions is a promising new avenue for therapeutic targeting of PDAC. In this chapter we will discuss a variety of therapies now entering the clinic that specifically target the tumor stroma. Among these are therapies that reduce the tumor stroma, allowing for a more effective delivery of conventional therapeutics to the cancer cells; antibodies that activate a macrophage-mediated immune response to the tumor and overcome its immunosuppressive environment; and inhibitors of signaling pathways that promote the vascularization of the tumor."

Search terms included capecitabine, Xeloda, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. The references of the identified articles were reviewed for additional sources. In addition, product information was obtained from Roche Pharmaceuticals. Studies from the identified literature that addressed this article's objectives were selected for review, with preference given to Phase II/III trials.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Capecitabine is an oral prodrug that is converted to its only active metabolite, FU, by thymidine phosphorylase. Higher levels of this enzyme are found in several tumors and the liver, compared with normal healthy tissue. In adults, capecitabine has a bioavailability of approximately 100% with a Cmax of 3.9 mg/L, Tmax of 1.5 to 2 hr, and AUC of 5.96 mg.h/L. The predominant route of elimination is renal, and dosage reduction of 75% is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 to 50 mL/min. The drug is contraindicated if CrCl is < 30 mL/min. Capecitabine has shown varying degrees of efficacy with acceptable tolerability in numerous cancers including prostate, renal cell, ovarian, and pancreatic, with the largest amount of evidence in metastatic breast and colorectal cancer. Single-agent capecitabine was compared with IV FU/leucovorin (LV) using the bolus Mayo Clinic regimen in 2 Phase III trials as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Overall response rate (RR) favored the capecitabine arm (26% vs 17%, P < 0.001); however, this did not translate into a difference in time to progression (TTP) (4.6 months vs 4.7 months) or overall survival (OS) (12.9 months vs 12.8 months). In Phase II noncomparative trials, combinations of capecitabine with oxaliplatin or irinotecan have produced results similar to regimens combining FU/LV with the same agents in patients with colorectal cancer. In metastatic breast cancer patients who had received prior treatment with an anthracycline-based regimen, a Phase III trial comparing the combination of capecitabine with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone demonstrated superior objective tumor RR (42% vs 30%, P = 0.006), median TTP (6.1 months vs 4.2 months, P < 0.001), and median OS (14.5 months vs 11.5 months, P = 0.013) with the combination treatment. Noncomparative Phase II studies have also supported efficacy in patients with metastatic breast cancer pretreated with both anthracyclines and taxanes, yielding an overall RR of 15% to 29% and median OS of 9.4 to 15.2 months. The most common dose-limiting adverse effects associated with capecitabine monotherapy are hyperbilirubinemia, diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome. Myelosuppression, fatigue and weakness, abdominal pain, and nausea have also been reported. Compared with bolus FU/LV, capecitabine was associated with more hand-foot syndrome but less stomatitis, alopecia, neutropenia requiring medical management, diarrhea, and nausea. Capecitabine has been reported to increase serum phenytoin levels and the international normalized ratio in patients receiving concomitant phenytoin and warfarin, respectively. The dose of capecitabine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for both metastatic colorectal and breast cancer is 1250 Mg/M2 given orally twice per day, usually separated by 12 hours for the first 2 weeks of every 3-week cycle.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Capecitabine is currently approved by the FDA for use as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer when single-agent fluoropyrimidine therapy is preferred. The drug is also approved for use as (1) a single agent in metastatic breast cancer patients who are resistant to both anthracycline- and paclitaxel-based regimens or in whom further anthracycline treatment is contra indicated and (2) in combination with docetaxel after failure of prior anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Single-agent and combination regimens have also shown benefits in patients with prostate, pancreatic, renal cell, and ovarian cancers. Improved tolerability and comparable efficacy compared with IV FU/LV in addition to oral administration make capecitabine an attractive option for the treatment of several types of cancers as well as the focus of future trials."

Preclinical evidence that pancreatic cancer is a systemic disease suggests a possible benefit for early administration of systemic therapy in these patients. In locally advanced disease, the role of chemoradiotherapy is increasingly being questioned, particularly considering the results of the LAP-07 trial. Novel biomarkers are clearly needed to identify subsets of patients likely to benefit from chemoradiotherapy. In the metastatic setting, FOLFIRINOX (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin), and nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine have yielded only modest improvements in survival.

Therefore, inhibition of the EGFR signaling pathway could be an attractive therapeutic target in this tumor. Although several combinations of EGFR inhibitors with chemotherapy demonstrate inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis, tumor cell apoptosis, and regression in xenograft models, these benefits remain to be confirmed.\n    \n\n\n          Expert opinion:\n        \n      \n      The encouraging results from preclinical and early clinical studies with cetuximab in pancreatic cancer were not confirmed in a Phase III trial.

Length of stay (6 vs 7 days), readmissions (20% vs 30%), and mortality were equivalent (1% vs 0%). On final pathology, the FOLFIRINOX group had a significant decrease in lymph node positivity (35% vs 79%) and perineural invasion (72% vs 95%).

Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for patients presenting with advanced pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine achieves a modest improvement in overall survival and is the gold standard for advanced pancreatic cancer treatment. Capecitabine and S-1, derivatives of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), offers minimal clinical benefits. Folfirinox represents a new and aggressive regimen that might benefit patients of metastatic pancreatic cancer with good performance status. Other chemotherapy drugs such as platinums and irinotecan do not provide significant improvement in overall survival, but have been used as part of combinational therapies. Comparing to systemically delivered chemotherapy, regional intra-arterial chemotherapy achieves higher local drug concentration in tumors with lower systemic drug toxicity, and may serve as a better treatment regimen. Although there have been progress made in chemotherapeutic strategies against pancreatic cancer, the overall survival is not significantly improved in the last decade. Recently, development of chemotherapy in combination with molecular targeted therapies holds great promise in pancreatic cancer treatment, especially in patients with metastatic disease. Growing bodies of preclinical and clinical evidences indicate that the combination of conventional modalities with specific molecular targeted therapy increase the efficacy of the monotherapy without an increase in toxicity. In this review, we summarized the current regimens of chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer and highlighted the novel combinational treatments tested in recent clinical trials."

            "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer still remains a significant, unresolved therapeutic challenge and is the most lethal type of gastrointestinal cancer with a 5-year survival rate of 5%. Adjuvant chemotherapy remains to be gemcitabine alone, though fluorouracil offers the same survival and role of radiation remains controversial. Nevertheless, only a few patients survive for at least 5 years after R0 resection and adjuvant therapy. Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer remains an area that requires multi-disciplinary approach. Neo-adjuvant therapy very likely plays a role to downstage to a resectable state in these subgroup patients. There are different treatment approaches to locally advanced pancreatic cancer management, including single or multi-agent chemotherapy, chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation, or immediate concurrent chemoradiation. Most patients need palliative treatment. Once pancreatic cancer becomes metastatic, it is uniformly fatal with an overall survival of generally 6 months from time of diagnosis. Gemcitabine has been the standard since 1997. FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin) has already shown superiority over gemcitabine in both progression-free survival and overall survival, but this regimen is suitable only for selected patients in ECOG performance status 0-1. FOLFIRINOX has already trickled down to the clinic in various modifications and in different patient groups, both locally advanced and metastatic. Many targeted agents, including bevacizumab, cetuximab showed negative results, except mild benefit with addition of erlotinib with gemcitabine, which was not considered clinically significant. There is no consensus regarding treatment in the second-line setting. It will be true to say that there was a real medical breakthrough with regards to improving the prognosis of pancreatic cancer as of 2013 with the results of MPACT study. In this study, patients who received nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine lived a median of 8.5 months, compared with 6.7 months for those who received gemcitabine alone. At the end of one year, 35% of those getting nab-paclitaxel were alive, compared with 22% of those getting only gemcitabine.

In contrast to other solid tumors, however, the impact of novel therapeutic strategies on clinical outcomes in patients with pancreas adenocarcinoma (PAC) has been limited to date. Gemcitabine was established as a standard of care for treatment of advanced PAC in 1997 based on an observed improvement in clinical benefit as adjudicated principally by pain scores and analgesic consumption, and demonstration of an overall survival (OS) benefit in a randomized comparison with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Since then, multiple agents targeting oncogenic signaling pathways and mediators of angiogenesis have failed to improve outcomes in phase III clinical trials when compared with gemcitabine monotherapy. An exception to this is the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy erlotinib, which yielded a survival benefit in patients with advanced disease in combination with gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine alone, although this was a marginal incremental improvement for which the clinical significant has been heavily debated. More recently, the most significant therapeutic advance in PAC has come from the combination of several cytotoxic agents; infusional 5-FU, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. This combination chemotherapy regimen, known as FOLFIRINOX, improved survival in patients with an excellent functional status and stage IV disease by 4.3 months compared with gemcitabine alone. This improvement in survival did come at the cost expectedly of a significant increase in toxicities, including gastrointestinal and hematologic particularly. Other gemcitabine-based combination chemotherapy regimens including gemcitabine and platinum analogs and gemcitabine and capecitabine have consistently shown an increased response rate but no OS benefit in individual trials; albeit pooled and meta-analyses have indicated a survival benefit in good performance status patient for both these cytotoxic combinations. Accordingly, the 5-year survival for patients with PAC remains <5%, with an annual disease-specific mortality which approaches the incidence. The challenge remains therefore, to develop more effective systemic therapies against this challenging malignancy. Recent progress toward understanding the genetic events in the development of PAC, in combination with advances in the field of pharmacogenomics offer hope that we may build on achievements to-date to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for PAC in years to come."

Because of reported response rates exceeding 30 %, the authors began to use a modified (m) FOLFIRINOX regimen for patients with advanced nonmetastatic disease aimed at downstaging for resection.

Therapeutic research efforts have mainly focused on improvements in radio/ chemo treatments and to date, there are only a few chemotherapeutic agents that have shown to be effective against PC, including gemcitabine with or without abraxane as well as a combination of 5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and irinotecan (the so-called FOLFIRINOX regimen). The survival of patients treated with these regimens is marginal and hence we are in urgent need of novel therapeutic approaches to treat pancreatic cancer. The success of immunotherapeutic strategies in other cancers and various evidences that pancreatic adenocarcinoma elicits antitumor immune responses, suggest that immunotherapies can be a promising alternative treatment modality for this deadly disease.

Previous studies of several combination regimens showed minimal or no significant change in overall survival compared with gemcitabine alone. Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) overexpression in pancreatic stromal fibroblasts is considered one of the major causes of chemotherapy resistance. The nanoparticle albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) has been found to be superior to other formulations of paclitaxel because of its favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Initial preclinical studies showed its synergistic effect with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer, in which nab-paclitaxel is sequestered by SPARC to cause stromal depletion and increasing microvasculature, resulting in higher gemcitabine concentration within the tumor. In the recent phase III multinational Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial (MPACT), the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel was shown to be superior to gemcitabine monotherapy, with an increase in median survival of 1.8 months.

One fundamental approach to improve survival rates is by earlier and improved diagnosis of the disease. In recent years, novel blood-based biomarkers have emerged based on genetic, epigenetic and protein changes in PDAC with very promising results. For biomarkers to enter clinical practice they need to have been developed using adequate control groups and provide high sensitivity and specificity and by this identify patients at risk already in a pre-symptomatic stage.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of irinotecan and oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (FU) and leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX) as second-line therapy in metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (MPA).\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 27 patients with MPA treated with FOLFIRINOX as second-line therapy between January 2003 and November 2009 in our hospital. The recommended schedule was oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) on day 1 + irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) on day 1 + leucovorin 400 mg/m(2) on day 1 followed by FU 400 mg/m(2) as a bolus on day 1 and 2,400 mg/m(2) as 46-hour continuous infusion biweekly.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The median age of the 27 patients (13 males and 14 females) was 63 years (45-83). All patients had progressive disease after first-line chemotherapy by gemcitabine. A total of 167 cycles were administered, with a median number of 6 cycles (1-29) per patient. One toxic death occurred (sepsis). Tolerance of treatment was acceptable, and the relative dose density delivered per patient was 92.8% for oxaliplatin, 89.1% for irinotecan and 96.4% for FU. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 55.6% of the patients, including 1 febrile neutropenia. The other toxicities were manageable. Regarding efficacy, 22 of the 27 patients were evaluable (WHO and RECIST criteria). Five patients had partial responses and 12 stable disease, resulting in an overall disease control rate of 63%. Median time to progression was 5.4 months (0.7-25.48), and median event-free survival was 3 months (0.5-24.9). Median overall survival was 8.5 months (0-26). A clinical benefit was reported for 55% of the patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These results confirmed the good safety profile and the efficacy of the FOLFIRINOX regimen as second-line treatment of MPA."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma still remains associated with a desperate prognosis. Nevertheless, treatment options for patients with metastasized disease have improved considerably over the last few years. Recently, cytotoxic combination therapies such as the FOLFIRINOX regimen and combined nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine have shown improved overall survival compared to gemcitabine alone. There is still no standard of care in second-line therapy for patients with disease progression.\n    \n\n\n          Case report:\n        \n      \n      We report the case of a 47-year-old patient who dramatically responded to second-line treatment with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine after primary progression to the FOLFIRINOX protocol.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Second-line treatment after FOLFIRINOX is feasible for patients with good performance status. Our case report supports preclinical findings that suggest that pancreatic cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Further studies that characterize possible subgroups and identify predictive molecular markers to guide therapy are warranted."

            "title": "Treatment of colorectal liver metastases.",
            "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the word. Liver metastasis is the most common site of colorectal metastases. The prognosis of resectable colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) was improved in the recent years with the consideration of chemotherapy and surgical resection as part of the multidisciplinary management of the disease; the current 5-year survival rates after resection of liver metastases are 25% to 40%. Resectable synchronous or metachronous liver metastases should be treated with perioperative chemotherapy based on three months of FOLFOX4 (5-fluorouracil [5FU], folinic acid [LV], and oxaliplatin) chemotherapy before surgery and three months after surgery. In the case of primary surgery, pseudo-adjuvant chemotherapy for 6 months, based on 5FU/LV, FOLFOX4, XELOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) or FOLFIRI (5FU/LV and irinotecan), should be indicated. In potentially resectable disease, primary chemotherapy based on more intensive regimens such as FOLFIRINOX (5FU/LV, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) should be considered to enhance the chance of cure. The palliative chemotherapy based on FOLFIRI, or FOLFOX4/XELOX with or without targeted therapies, is the mainstay treatment of unresectable disease. This review would provide additional insight into the problem of optimal integration of chemotherapy and surgery in the management of CRLM."

            "title": "Chemotherapy and other supportive modalities in the palliative setting for pancreatic cancer.",
            "abstract": "Metastatic pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with a dismal prognosis. Gemcitabine chemotherapy has been the mainstay of treatment for many years. Efforts to improve survival outcomes with gemcitabine-based combination chemotherapy regimens have been largely disappointing, with the possible exception of the addition of the targeted agent erlotinib. The multi-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen FOLFIRINOX (sequential administration of oxaliplatin immediately followed by leucovorin over 2 hours, and then irinotecan, followed by a bolus dose of 5-fluorouracil, and finally, a 46-hour infusion of 5-fluorouracil) has significantly improved survival compared with gemcitabine alone; however, this regimen can be highly toxic and may need to be reserved for those with an excellent performance status. This article reviews the existing evidence for the management of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with chemotherapy with special attention to careful patient selection. The data for chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy are discussed. Additional supportive modalities in the areas of pharmacologic and nutritional support to maximize quality of life are also outlined."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Serine hydrolases (SHs) are among the largest classes of enzymes in humans and play crucial role in many pathophysiological processes of cancer. We have undertaken a comprehensive proteomic analysis to assess the differential expression and cellular localization of SHs, which uncovered distinctive expression of Carboxylesterase 2 (CES2), the most efficient carboxyl esterase in activating the prodrug irinotecan into SN-38, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We therefore assessed the extent of heterogeneity in CES2 expression in PDAC and its potential relevance to irinotecan based therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      CES2 expression in PDAC and paired nontumor tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. CES2 activity was assessed by monitoring the hydrolysis of the substrate p-NPA and correlated with irinotecan IC50 values by means of Pearson's correlation. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were applied to assess the association between overall survival and CES2 expression in patients who underwent neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX treatment. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Statistically significant overexpression of CES2, both at the mRNA and protein levels, was observed in PDAC compared with paired nontumor tissue (P < .001), with 48 of 118 (40.7%) tumors exhibiting high CES2 expression. CES2 activity in 11 PDAC cell lines was inversely correlated with irinotecan IC50 values (R = -0.68, P = .02). High CES2 expression in tumor tissue was associated with longer overall survival in resectable and borderline resectable patients who underwent neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX treatment (hazard ratio = 0.14, 95% confidence interval = 0.04 to 0.51, P = .02).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our findings suggest that CES2 expression and activity, by mediating the intratumoral activation of irinotecan, is a contributor to FOLFIRINOX sensitivity in pancreatic cancer and CES2 assessment may define a subset of patients likely to respond to irinotecan based therapy."
