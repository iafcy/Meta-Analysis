ABSTRACT
Background. First-line
treatment
with
FOLFIRINOX
signiﬁcantly increases overall survival (OS) in patients
with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA) compared
with gemcitabine. The aim of this observational cohort was
to evaluate the tolerability and efﬁcacy of this regimen in
unresectable locally advanced PA (LAPA).
Patients and Methods. From February 2010 to February
2012, all consecutive patients from 11 French centers
treated by FOLFIRINOX for a histologically proven LAPA
were prospectively enrolled. Unresectability was deﬁned
independently by each center’s multidisciplinary staff at
diagnosis. Absence of metastatic disease was conﬁrmed by
chest-abdomen-pelvis computed tomography scan. FOLF-
IRINOX was delivered every 2 weeks as previously
reported until progressive disease, major toxicity, or con-
solidation treatment by radiotherapy and/or surgery.
Results. Seventy-seven
patients
were
enrolled.
They
received a median number of ﬁve cycles (1–30). Grade 3–4
toxicities were neutropenia (11 %), nausea (9 %), diarrhea
(6 %), fatigue (6 %), and anemia (1 %). Grade 2–3 sensory
neuropathy occurred in 25 % of patients. No toxic death
was reported and only 6 % of patients had to stop treatment
because of toxicity. Disease control rate was 84 with 28 %
of objective response (Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors). Seventy-ﬁve percent of patients received a
consolidation therapy: 70 % had radiotherapy and 36 %
underwent a surgical resection, with a curative intent.
Within the whole cohort, 1-year OS rate was 77 % (95 %
CI 65–86) and 1-year progression-free survival rate was
59 % (95 % CI 46–70).
Conclusion. First-line FOLFIRINOX for LAPA seems to
be effective and have a manageable toxicity proﬁle. These
promising results will have to be conﬁrmed in a phase III
randomized trial.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA) is a frequent and
severe disease with an overall 5-year survival rate of
approximately 6 %.1–3 The only way to cure patients is
radical surgical resection, but this is possible in less than

20 % of cases, and only increases the 5-year survival rate
to 10–27 %4–6 according to the administration of adjuvant
chemotherapy.
Locally advanced PA (LAPA) represents about 30 % of
pancreatic cancer and its prognosis is half-way between
that of metastatic and resectable pancreatic cancer. Its
deﬁnition remains controversial because resectability cri-
teria differ between centers. Its treatment consists of
palliative
chemotherapy,
classically
with
gemcitabine
similar with metastatic PA treatment.
The ACCORD-11/PRODIGE-4 trial,7 a randomized,
phase III trial, compared the FOLFIRINOX regimen with
gemcitabine in metastatic PA. It showed a signiﬁcant
improvement of median overall survival (OS) and pro-
gression-free survival (PFS), as well as an increase in
response rate. Increased toxicities were also reported with
this three-drug chemotherapy regimen, but the general
tolerability proﬁle was acceptable. However, no cases of
LAPA were treated in ACCORD-11/PRODIGE-4 and this
aggressive treatment has not been evaluated in this cate-
gory of patients. We therefore decided to evaluate the
tolerability and efﬁcacy of FOLFIRINOX in patients with
LAPA, in an AGEO (Association des Gastro-Ente´rologues
Oncologues) multicenter, prospective, observational series.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients with LAPA treated with the FOLFIRINOX
regimen as ﬁrst-line therapy, between February 2010 and
February 2012 in 11 French centers, were prospectively
enrolled in our database. To be eligible, patients had to be
18 years of age or older, have an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) score of
0, 1, or 2, and a histologically or cytologically proven PA
which was non-metastatic but deemed unresectable during
a multidisciplinary meeting with radiological and surgical
expertise. Chest-abdomen-pelvis computed tomography
(CT) scans were used to check for the absence of metas-
tases. Unresectability criteria were determined by each
institution’s multidisciplinary staff and were, in all cases,
arterial and/or major venous involvement (at least more
than 180 tumor contact, encasement). Previous chemo-
therapy or radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer was an
exclusion criterion. The demographic and clinical charac-
teristics of patients were computerized. As FOLFIRINOX
is considered a potential standard treatment for non-oper-
able pancreatic cancer, with normal bilirubin levels and
good performance status, in France, no informed consent
was needed for this observational series, as stated by the
Ethics Committee consulted prior to the start of the work.
Tumor
The following tumor-related information was collected:
date of diagnosis, size of the tumor in millimeters, location
of the tumor (head, body, or tail of the pancreas), absence
or presence of locoregional lymph node involvement on
CT scan, and unresectability criteria described as venous
(superior mesenteric vein, portal vein, portal thrombosis)
or
arterial
(superior
mesenteric
artery,
celiac
trunk)
involvement. The presence of a biliary stent was noted.
Initial evaluation included measurement of carbohydrate
antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9).
Treatment
One cycle of FOLFIRINOX consisted of a 2-h intrave-
nous infusion of oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2) followed by a 2-h
intravenous infusion of leucovorin (400 mg/m2) concomi-
tantly with a 90-min intravenous infusion of irinotecan
(180 mg/m2), followed by a bolus (400 mg/m2) and a 46-h
continuous infusion (2,400 mg/m2) of 5-ﬂuorouracil. The
FOLFIRINOX regimen was delivered every 2 weeks until
disease progression, patient refusal, unacceptable toxicity,
or consolidation therapy by external radiotherapy and/or
surgery. Primary prophylaxis of neutropenia using granu-
locyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was initiated at
the physician’s discretion.
Outcomes
Treatment Tolerability
The day of the ﬁrst infusion of
FOLFIRINOX and the number of cycles performed were
recorded. Treatment tolerability was assessed by recording
all chemotherapy-related adverse events occurring during
the study. Nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, sensory
neuropathy, hand–foot syndrome, mucositis, alopecia,
neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia,
and
anemia
were
evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute
Common
Terminology
Criteria
for
Adverse
Events
V3.0.8 Serious adverse events, including treatment-related
deaths, grade 3 or 4 toxicities, toxic withdrawals, and dose
reductions associated with adverse events, were noted.
Efﬁcacy
Disease
assessment
was
performed
every
2 months by means of chest-abdomen-pelvis CT scans
and CA 19–9 monitoring. Radiological tumor response was
deﬁned according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST)9 on CT scans. Tumor response
was classiﬁed into four groups: complete response, partial
response, stable disease, or progressive disease.
Consolidation therapy by surgical resection and/or exter-
nal radiotherapy were recorded, together with the day, type of
surgery (duodenopancreatectomy, splenopancreatectomy, or
296
L. Marthey et al.

total pancreatectomy), quality of the resection (R0 or R1),
and the 30-day postoperative complications for patients who
underwent surgical resection, and the dose of radiation
administered for those who received radiotherapy. Local or
metastatic relapse and death after consolidation therapy were
recorded. In the case of progressive disease, if second-line
chemotherapy was administered this was recorded.
Statistical Analysis
Patients’ records were prospectively entered into the
database. Quantitative data were described with the median
(range), and qualitative data were described with the per-
centage. There was no statistical hypothesis. A v2 test was
used to compare qualitative data such as resection rate
among patients with or without arterial involvement.
Objective response was deﬁned as patients with com-
plete response or partial response. Disease control rate was
deﬁned
as
patients
with
complete
response,
partial
response, or stable disease. PFS was deﬁned as the time
elapsed from the start of FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy until
the date of progression or death (all causes), whichever
occurred ﬁrst. OS was deﬁned as the time elapsed from the
start of FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy until death (all
causes). Patients without events were censored at the last
follow-up date. Survival curves were estimated using the
Kaplan–Meier method. Median follow-up was calculated
with the reverse Kaplan–Meier method. All analyses were
performed with a two-sided alpha type 1 error of 5 %.
RESULTS
Characteristics of Patients and Tumors
Between February 2010 and February 2012, 77 patients
were enrolled. Their baseline characteristics are summa-
rized in Table 1. Most patients had a good performance
status, ECOG-PS 0 or 1. Most tumors were located in the
head of the pancreas and 36 patients (47 %) needed a
biliary stent before starting chemotherapy. Fifty patients
had arterial involvement (65 %), concomitantly with a
venous involvement for half of them, and 26 patients
(35 %) had no arterial involvement but a major venous
involvement ([180, encasement) which contraindicated
surgical resection.
Tolerability
The median number of cycles administered was ﬁve
(range 1–30). No toxic death occurred and only ﬁve
patients (6 %) had to stop chemotherapy because of tox-
icity. Treatment was stopped for disease progression in 12
cases (16 %) and for consolidation therapy (radiotherapy or
surgery) in 58 cases (75 %). Grade 3–4 toxicities occurred
in 20 patients (26 %) and are described in Table 2. Grade
2–3 sensory neuropathy occurred in 19 patients (25 %). A
dose reduction was necessary in 50 cases (65 %). The 5-
ﬂuorouracil bolus was stopped in 25 patients (32 %)
because of cytopenia, oxaliplatin was stopped in 24
patients (31 %) after at least six cycles because of neuro-
toxicity, and the irinotecan dose was reduced in 22 patients

(29 %). Prophylactic G-CSF treatment was used in 63
patients (82 %). Only 10 patients (13 %) lost more than
5 % of their total body weight and 11 patients (14 %)
gained more than 5 %.
Efﬁcacy
Survival and tumor response results are summarized in
Table 3.
Response
Partial response rate was observed in 22
patients (28 %) and stable disease in 43 patients (56 %),
leading to a disease control rate of 84 % (95 % CI 76–93).
Among the 60 patients with baseline CA 19.9 [ 37 IU/mL,
38 (63 %) exhibited a signiﬁcant decrease ([30 %) in
plasma CA 19.9 level, and 21 (35 %) normalized their CA
19.9.
Moreover, 58 patients (75 %) could undergo post-che-
motherapy consolidation therapy: 54 patients (70 %)
received external radiotherapy with a median dose of
54 Gy (range 45–65 Gy) and 28 (36 %) had a pancreatic
resection. Consolidation therapy was decided after the ﬁrst
tumor evaluation in 74 % of cases (n = 43/58).
Survival
With a median follow-up of 15 months (range
3–31), median OS was 22 months, with an upper limit of
the 95 % CI not reached. The OS rates at 6, 12, and
18 months were 96 % (95 % CI 88–99), 77 % (95 % CI
65–86), and 56 % (95 % CI 40–69), respectively. The PFS
rates at 6, 12, and 18 months were 96 % (95 % CI 88–99),
59 % (95 % CI 46–70), and 43 % (95 % CI 29–56),
respectively (Fig. 1).
Consolidation Therapy and Outcome
Among the 12
patients
with
a
progressive
disease
despite
the
FOLFIRINOX regimen, 11 (92 %) underwent second-line
chemotherapy, all but one by gemcitabine. Among the 28
patients
who
underwent surgical
resection,
all
were
controlled by FOLFIRINOX and 24 (86 %) were treated
by external radiotherapy before surgery. R0 resection on
pathological examination was described in 25 patients
(89 %). Only seven patients (25 %) had nodal involvement
and four patients (14 %) achieved complete histological
response on pancreatectomy specimen. Twenty-ﬁve patients
(89 %) had a duodenopancreatectomy, two patients (7 %)
had a splenopancreatectomy, and one patient (4 %) had a
total
pancreatectomy.
Among
patients
who
achieved
surgical
resection,
12
(43 %)
had
initial
venous
involvement only and 16 (57 %) had arterial involvement
(p = 0.22). Among patients with venous involvement only,
44 % (n = 12/27) were resected; among those with arterial
involvement, 32 % (n = 16/50) were resected. Twelve
patients (43 %) had postoperative complications. Two
patients (7 %) died, both from mesenteric ischemia (one at
day 2 and the other at day 19). Other postoperative
complications were bleeding (n = 3), infection (n = 3),
ascites (n = 2), gastroparesis (n = 2), anastomotic ﬁstulae
(n = 1), respiratory dysfunction (n = 1) and lymphorrhea
(n = 1). Altogether, 22 of 28 operated patients (79 %) were
still alive at the end of the study. In these patients who were
amenable to surgery, median PFS and OS were 22.5 months
(95 % CI 12.9–ND) and 24.9 months (95 % CI 21.1–ND)
from the date of the ﬁrst chemotherapy cycle, respectively.
Median PFS was 13.2 months (95 % CI 7.4–ND) from the
date of surgery. Among the 30 patients who underwent
consolidation therapy by external radiotherapy only, the
median number of folﬁrinox infusions received was 6 (range
3–16). In these patients, median PFS and OS from the date of
ﬁrst chemotherapy cycle were 11.7 months (95 % CI 6.9–
12.8] and 15.9 months (95 % CI 13.4–ND), respectively.
Eighteen patients relapsed (60 %), with distant metastases in
14 cases (47 %).

DISCUSSION
During the period of our study, from 2010 to 2012, the
standard treatment of borderline or locally advanced pan-
creatic cancer was gemcitabine-based chemotherapy with
or
without
subsequent
consolidation
chemoradiother-
apy.10–14 In this setting, for the whole population starting
gemcitabine monotherapy, PFS of 7 months and OS of 9–
13 months were reported.12,13,15 In the subgroup of patients
who had disease control after 3 months of chemotherapy,
consolidation
radiochemotherapy
resulted
in
PFS
of
11 months and OS of 15 months in a large cohort of 181
patients.13 These treatments allowed secondary surgical
resection in up to 21 % of patients.16,17
However, the very recent report of the LAP 07 study
presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO) 2013 annual meeting showed the absence of
beneﬁt of consolidation radiotherapy in LAPA compared
with chemotherapy alone, making consolidation radio-
therapy debatable today. More intensive chemotherapeutic
regimens thus seem an interesting option in this particular
population with limited disease and potential secondary
resection possibilities.
Few data about FOLFIRINOX in LAPA are currently
available. In a phase II trial18 evaluating this schedule, both
metastatic (76 %) and locally advanced (24 %) pancreatic
cancer were included. In another work, Hosein et al.19
recently published a retrospective cohort study of non-
metastatic PA treated by FOLFIRINOX including 23 % of
resectable tumors. Two other retrospective studies evalu-
ated 16 and 22 patients treated by FOLFIRINOX for
LAPA20,21 and showed a good response rate—27 and 50 %
respectively. The present study is based upon the largest
cohort of patients with LAPA treated with FOLFIRINOX.
With 28 % of patients with an objective response, a disease
control rate of 84 %, and median PFS and OS of 13 and
22 months, respectively, this regimen seems to be effective.
However, it has to be stated that a signiﬁcant impact of post-
FOLFIRINOX treatment (e.g. chemoradiotherapy and/or
surgery) could have substantially inﬂuenced the outcomes
of different patients from different centers along with
impacted the OS. In fact, tumor control and downsizing
allowed 75 % of patients to have consolidation therapy,
including pancreatic resection with a curative intent. Sev-
enty percent of patients received external radiotherapy and
36 % had a pancreatic resection. These results compare
favorably with those obtained with gemcitabine-based
chemotherapy10,11 or radiochemotherapy12,13 and are in line
with the series of patients treated with FOLFIRINOX
mentioned previously.18–21 Table 4 summarizes efﬁcacy
results reported in patients with LAPA treated with che-
motherapy or chemoradiotherapy.
In the metastatic setting, FOLFIRINOX is more toxic
than gemcitabine;7 however, its safety proﬁle seems more
favorable in our patients with LAPA. One-quarter of our
patients had grade 3–4 toxicities, but with only 6 % of
treatment withdrawal because of tolerability problems. No
toxic death occurred. Furthermore, although studies should
be compared with caution, the tolerability of FOLFIRI-
NOX was better in our study than in those reported by
Conroy et al. and Hosein et al.18,19 In these studies, the
cumulative rate of grade 3–4 toxicities was higher than
40 %. These differences could be explained by the better
condition of LAPA patients, but also by the chemotherapy

dose reduction which occurred in 2/3 of our patients and
the use of prophylactic G-CSF in 82 % of our patients.
Fifty-eight
patients
received
consolidation
therapy.
Some patients received radiotherapy (n = 30), others had
surgical
resection
(n = 4),
and
some
received
both
(n = 24). Preoperative chemoradiotherapy was adminis-
tered to the vast majority of patients who underwent
surgery. Among patients who underwent a pancreatic
resection, we recorded two early postoperative deaths,
leading to a postoperative mortality rate of 7 %, which is in
line with the US in-hospital mortality rate published by Teh
et al.22 in 2009. Both patients had extended pancreatic
resections and received a combined treatment with che-
motherapy and radiotherapy before surgery, and these are
known to increase the rates of morbidity and mortality of
pancreatic surgery.16,17,23–25
However, this prospective, multicenter study has limi-
tations as the number of patients was limited and it was not
a phase II trial but an observational cohort. Moreover, only
good general condition patients with 0–1 performance
status and normal bilirubin levels were enrolled. However,
the large homogenous cohort of LAPA patients of the
present study seems representative of the general popula-
tion of patients in this setting. Indeed, the majority of
patients were men, had pancreatic head cancer with lymph
node involvement, required a biliary stent, and had a tumor
of 3 cm or more, as reported in previous work on
LAPA.12,13,15,17,19 Moreover, the evaluation of non-
resectability criteria was independently deﬁned by each
center at a multidisciplinary staff meeting, as in real-life
conditions. For this reason, it might be argued that some
patients included in this prospective study may have had
borderline rather than unresectable pancreatic cancer,
particularly among patients with venous involvement only,
who represented one-third of our population study. Indeed
this may be partly true as the deﬁnition of unresectability
was based, in our study, on real-life multidisciplinary staff
decisions and we did not realize a centralized analysis of
CT scans. However, this also reﬂects the variability of
deﬁnitions of borderline and locally advanced in the lit-
erature (Society of Surgical Oncology/AHPBH; National
Comprehensive Cancer Network; MD Anderson).26 Nev-
ertheless, it is of note that the resection rate among patients
with venous involvement and those with arterial involve-
ment was similar, and that the surgical resection rate in the
subgroup of patients with arterial involvement was high
(32 %). Finally, most patients who achieved surgical
resection had also received previous radiotherapy; it is
therefore difﬁcult to know if the good resection rate
observed was due to the FOLFIRINOX regimen, to con-
solidation radiotherapy, or both. However, our efﬁcacy
results compare favorably with previous results of che-
motherapy followed by radiotherapy,13 as mentioned
before, and the negative results of the LAP 07 study
mentioned previously may favor our intensive chemo-
therapeutic regimen.
CONCLUSIONS
The FOLFIRINOX regimen seems feasible, with a
manageable toxicity proﬁle, and gives promising efﬁcacy
results in LAPA. A randomized trial assessing FOLFIRI-
NOX versus gemcitabine in this setting is currently
ongoing.
