Abstract Although FOLFIRINOX signiﬁcantly increases 
survival in metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC) compared to 
gemcitabine (Conroy et al. N Engl J Med 364:1817–1825, 
2011), toxicities have tempered enthusiasm for its use in full 
doses. To assess the impact of dose attenuations on toxicity 
and efﬁcacy, we reviewed our institution’s experience with 
FOLFIRINOX in locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
(LAPC) and MPC. We performed a retrospective review of 
dose, toxicity, and efﬁcacy of FOLFIRINOX in all patients 
with LAPC and MPC treated between June 2010 and July 
2011 at Yale. Toxicities in all patients and response rate (RR) 
and survival in previously untreated MPC were compared to 
data reported by Conroy. Overall survival (OS) and pro- 
gression-free survival were estimated by Kaplan–Meier 
method. Thirty-ﬁve patients were treated (16 LAPC; 19 
MPC). Twenty-nine patients received dose attenuations with 
the ﬁrst cycle. Median relative doses of irinotecan and bolus 
ﬂuorouracil were less than those reported by Conroy (64 vs. 
81 % and 66 vs. 82 %, respectively). RR was 50 % in LAPC 
and 47 % in MPC, and the latter did not differ signiﬁcantly 
from the RR reported by Conroy (p = 0.19). OS at 6 and 
12 months in MPC was comparable to OS reported by 
Conroy. Grade 3/4 toxicities were less than reported by 
including fatigue (p = 0.009) and neutropenia 
Conroy, 
(p \ 0.0001). Nine patients experienced transient dysarthria 
during irinotecan administration. Our ﬁndings validate

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer- 
related death in men and women [1]. There were an esti- 
mated 43,920 new cases and 37,390 deaths from pancreatic 
cancer in the United States in 2012, and the 5-year survival 
for all patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma is \5 % 
[2]. The vast majority of patients (80–90 %) present with 
incurable metastatic or locally advanced unresectable dis- 
ease. Gemcitabine has been the standard of care for treat- 
ment of advanced pancreatic cancer for over a decade 
based on a randomized trial showing an improvement in 
the one-year survival with gemcitabine compared to ﬂuo- 
rouracil (FU) (18 vs. 2 %, p = 0.0001) [3]. Although well 
tolerated, the efﬁcacy of gemcitabine is marginal, with 
reported response rates of less than 10 % and median 
survivals of less than 7 months in patients with metastatic 
disease. Despite promising phase II trials with gemcita- 
bine-based combinations in advanced pancreatic cancer, 
the addition of cytotoxic drugs (e.g., FU, capecitabine, 
oxaliplatin, cisplatin, irinotecan) or targeted agents (bev- 
acizumab, cetuixmab, erlotinib) to gemcitabine has yielded 
no meaningful gains in overall survival in multiple ran- 
domized trials comparing gemcitabine doublets to gem- 
citabine alone, till recently [4–13]. 




Conroy et al. [14] ﬁrst reported impressive efﬁcacy and 
acceptable tolerability of the combination regimen FOLFIR- 
INOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 over 2 h, followed by irinotecan 
180 mg/m2 over 90 min and leucovorin 400 mg/m2 over 2 h, 
followed by FU 400 mg/m2 bolus and 2,400 mg/m2 46 h 
continuous infusion) in a phase II study in 46 patients with 
unresectable pancreatic cancer (11 locally advanced, 35 
metastatic). In this preliminary study, there were no toxic 
deaths, and the conﬁrmed response rate was 26 %, including 
4 % complete response rate, and median overall survival was 
10.2 months. Subsequently, FOLFIRINOX was compared to 
gemcitabine in a randomized phase III trial in patients with 
metastatic pancreatic cancer [15]. This study showed signiﬁ- 
cant improvements in overall survival (11.1 vs. 6.8 mo), 
progression-free survival (6.4 vs. 3.3 mo) and response rate 
(31.6 vs. 9.4 %) with FOLFIRINOX compared to gemcita- 
bine. However, FOLFIRINOX was associated with signiﬁ- 
cantly more grade 3 and 4 toxicity than gemcitabine (diarrhea, 
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and sen- 
sory neuropathy). Based on this study, FOLFIRINOX is 
considered the most effective regimen for metastatic pancre- 
atic cancer, and it is emerging as the new standard of care in 
appropriate patients with a good performance status. How- 
ever, given its toxicities, there has been a reluctance to use 
FOLFIRINOX in full doses, despite the signiﬁcant increase in 
efﬁcacy of this regimen compared to gemcitabine. 
It is unknown whether the administration of attenuated 
doses of FOLFIRINOX compromises its efﬁcacy. More- 
over, there is a paucity of data regarding the efﬁcacy of 
FOLFIRINOX in patients with non-metastatic locally 
advanced pancreatic cancer. We conducted a retrospective 
review of patients with metastatic or locally advanced 
unresectable pancreatic cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX 
at Yale’s Smilow Cancer Center to assess the efﬁcacy and 
the toxicities of this regimen as it is used in an academic 
practice with routine dose attenuations. 


We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with 
locally advanced unresectable and metastatic pancreatic 
cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX at Yale’s Smilow Cancer 
Center between June 2010 and July 2011. We evaluated 
patient characteristics, toxicities, response rate (RR), pro- 
gression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) based 
on review of the patients’ medical records and imaging 
studies. Toxicities in the entire Yale cohort (locally advanced 
and metastatic patients), and patient characteristics and RR in 
the metastatic cohort, were compared to the FOLFIRINOX- 
treated group as reported by Conroy et al. [15]. 


Full dose FOLFIRINOX consisted of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 
over 2 h, followed by irinotecan (IRI) 180 mg/m2 over 
90 min and leucovorin (LV) 400 mg/m2 over 2 h, followed by 
FU 400 mg/m2 as a bolus and 2,400 mg/m2 as a 46 h con- 
tinuous infusion. Dose modiﬁcations were made at the treating 
physician’s discretion. All patients received peg-ﬁlgrastim 
with the ﬁrst cycle and subsequent cycles in the absence of 
severe leukocytosis. Patients routinely received palonosetron, 
aprepitant, and dexamethasone for emesis prophylaxis. 

Patients were evaluated for toxicities at the start of each 
cycle with history, examination, performance status, com- 
plete blood count, and metabolic panel. Response assess- 
imaging was obtained after every 4–6 cycles of 
ment 
treatment. All scans were systematically reviewed by the 
investigators (KSG, JRT) for response by RECIST. 

Treatment was discontinued at the discretion of the treating 
physician for unacceptable toxicity, progression of disease, 
including surgical 
or pursuit of alternative therapies, 
resection or radiotherapy for locally advanced disease. 
Patients were followed for PFS and OS. 

Toxicities in the entire Yale group were compared with the 
toxicities in the FOLFIRINOX-treated group as reported by 
Conroy et al. [15]. One-sample proportion test was used to 
compare the proportion of grade 3 and 4 adverse events 
(AEs). Patient characteristics and RR of the Yale metastatic 
cohort were compared with the FOLFIRINOX-treated group 
as reported by Conroy et al. [15]. One-sample Wilcoxon 
signed rank test or Fisher’s exact test was used to compare 
patient characteristics. One-sample proportion test was used 
to compare the RR in previously untreated metastatic 
patients. OS and PFS analyses were performed using Kap- 
lan–Meier method. Two patients in the metastatic cohort 
who had received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease 
were excluded from RR and survival analysis. 


21Between June 2010 and July 2011, 35 patients with 
advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma were treated with 


FOLFIRINOX at the Yale Smilow Cancer Center, including 
16 with locally advanced unresectable disease and 19 with 
metastatic disease. The demographics and disease character- 
istics are shown in Table 1. Compared to the series reported by 
Conroy et al. [15] in previously untreated patients with met- 
astatic disease who received FOLFIRINOX, more patients 
with metastatic disease in our cohort were female (p = 0.006) 
and had ECOG PS of 0 (p = 0.003). In our 19 patients with 
metastatic disease, 2 had received prior adjuvant chemother- 
apy, 1 had received prior neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, 
and 2 had received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. 

Dose modiﬁcations were at the discretion of the treating 
physician. Only 6 of 35 patients received full doses of each 
drug of FOLFIRINOX with the ﬁrst cycle. In the remaining 
29 patients, dose attenuations with the ﬁrst cycle were as 
follows: IRI was reduced in 27 and omitted in 1, OX was 
reduced in 10, bolus FU was reduced in 9 and omitted in 7, 
LV was decreased in 11, infusional FU was reduced in 3. 
The median number of cycles received was 11 (range 
1–28). The median relative doses of each drug (in com- 
parison with the median relative doses in FOLFIRINOX- 
treated patients reported by Conroy et al. [15]) were as 
follows: OX 90 % (vs. 78 %), IRI 64 % (vs. 81 %), bolus 
FU 66 % (vs. 82 %), and infusional FU 100 % (vs. 82 %). 
34 of 35 patients received peg-ﬁlgrastim with the ﬁrst cycle 
and subsequent cycles, except in the event of severe leu- 
kocytosis, at the discretion of the treating physician. 


Response rates in patients with locally advanced and 
metastatic disease are shown in Table 2. Two of 19 patients 
with metastatic disease were excluded from the analysis, as 
they had received prior chemotherapy for metastatic 
disease. The RR (CR ? PR) in the entire group (locally 
advanced and metastatic) was 48 %, with 1 CR and 15 PR 
in 33 patients. In patients with metastatic disease, the RR 
was 47 % and did not differ signiﬁcantly from the RR of 
32 % reported by Conroy et al. in FOLFIRINOX-treated 
patients (p = 0.19). In patients with locally advanced dis- 
ease, the RR was 50 %, and two patients were able to 
undergo resection after 4 and 6 cycles. One of these 
patients had a near pathologic complete response with 
2 mm of residual tumor. 

The survival data are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 1. For the 
entire cohort of patients (locally advanced and metastatic), 
the median PFS was 16.1 months, and the median OS has 
not been reached. 
In patients with metastatic disease, the median PFS and 
OS were 9.9 and 11.2 months, respectively. The PFS in the 
metastatic cohort at 6 and 12 months was 76 and 35 %, 
respectively, and the OS at 6 and 12 months was 82 and 
the OS at 6 and 
50 %, respectively. By comparison, 
12 months was 75.9 and 48.4 %, respectively, 
in the 
FOLFIRINOX-treated patients as reported by Conroy et al. 
[15]. 
In patients with locally advanced disease, the median 
PFS and OS have not been reached. The PFS for locally 
advanced disease at 6 and 12 months was 94 and 77 %, 
respectively, and the OS at 6 and 12 months was 94 and 
83 %, respectively. 

Treatment-related grade 3 and 4 toxicities are summarized 
in Table 4. There were no toxic deaths attributable to 
FOLFIRINOX. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 fatigue (5.7 
vs. 23.6 %, p = 0.009) and neutropenia (11.4 vs. 45.7 %, 
p \ 0.0001) was signiﬁcantly decreased in our cohort 
compared to the FOLFIRINOX-treated patients as reported

estimates of overall survival 
(a) and progression-free 
survival (b) of patients with 
locally advanced (dotted line) 
and metastatic (solid line) 
pancreatic cancer 
by Conroy et al. [15]. There was a non-signiﬁcant trend 
toward a lower incidence of febrile neutropenia, anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, vomiting, diarrhea, and neuropathy 
compared to the FOLFIRINOX-treated patients as reported 
by Conroy et al. [15]. Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea in our patient 
population was just 2.9 % compared to 12.7 % in the 
FOLFIRINOX-treated patients as reported by Conroy et al. 
[15]. 
In our study, there were nine cases of acute onset of 
dysarthria and other neurological symptoms during the 
FOLFIRINOX infusion. These symptoms included dysar- 
thric speech, facial or perioral paresthesias, leg cramps, 
ataxia, and blepharospasm. In all cases, the onset of these 
neurological symptoms was temporally associated with the 
irinotecan infusion. The symptoms remitted with inter- 
ruption of the irinotecan infusion, and in some cases, 
recurred with re-challenge. In all cases, 
the symptoms 
resolved completely without speciﬁc intervention other 
than transient interruption of the irinotcan infusion and/or 

administration of anticholinergic agents (atropine and/or 
diphenhydramine). The ﬁrst two patients in whom these 
symptoms developed were hospitalized for neurological 
work up to rule out a cerebral vascular event; subsequent 
patients were managed as out-patients in the infusion 
center. Dose reduction of irinotecan and/or pre-medication 
with anticholinergics, at 
the discretion of the treating 
physician, prevented or mitigated the severity of these 
neurologic symptoms in subsequent cycles in all patients. 

Our single institution retrospective study validates the 
efﬁcacy of FOLFIRINOX in unselected patients with 
locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer. The 
majority of the patients treated at our institution received 
attenuated doses of FOLFIRINOX with the ﬁrst and sub- 
sequent cycles of treatment, and the median relative doses

of IRI and bolus FU were lower than those reported in the 
FOLFIRINOX-treated group reported by Conroy et al. 
[15]. Nonetheless, our ﬁndings suggest that the efﬁcacy of 
FOLFIRINOX was not compromised by these dose modi- 
ﬁcations. The RR of 47 % in our patients with metastatic 
disease was not signiﬁcantly different from the RR of 32 % 
in the FOLFIRINOX-treated patients as reported by Con- 
roy et al. [15]. Moreover, the observed PFS and OS at 6 and 
12 months, as well as the median OS and PFS, in our 
patients with metastatic disease were also comparable to 
the survivals reported by Conroy et al. [15] in the FOLF- 
IRINOX-treated patients. 
Although FOLFIRINOX is associated with a signiﬁcant 
increase in response rate and overall survival in metastatic 
pancreatic cancer compared to gemcitabine, the toxicities of 
FOLFIRINOX have tempered enthusiasm for its use in full 
doses in community and academic centers [15]. Our study 
suggests that incorporation of modest dose attenuations of 
IRI and bolus FU in the majority of patients, in conjunction 
with routine use of growth factor support with the ﬁrst and 
subsequent cycles, is associated with less toxicity than 
observed in the FOLFIRINOX-treated patients reported by 
Conroy et al. [15]. We observed a signiﬁcant decrease in the 
incidence of grade 3 or 4 fatigue and neutropenia, and a trend 
toward decreased incidence of febrile neutropenia, anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, vomiting, and neuropathy in 
our cohort compared to the FOLFIRINOX-treated patients 
reported by Conroy et al. [15]. The improved tolerability of 
FOLFIRINOX in our institution’s cohort of patients may be 
related to the dose modiﬁcations, routine use of growth factor 
support, or the use of aggressive anti-emetic and anti-diar- 
rheal regimens. In addition, a higher percentage of our 
patients had an ECOG PS of 0 compared to the FOLFIRI- 
NOX-treated patients reported by Conroy et al. [15]. Inter- 
estingly, 57 % of our patients had carcinoma of the head of 
the pancreas, compared to 39 % of patients reported by 
Conroy et al. Although 31 % of our patients had biliary stents 
for obstruction, we observed only one case of cholangitis. 
The optimum treatment of locally advanced unresectable 
pancreatic cancer remains uncertain. Current 
therapeutic 
options include chemoradiation or chemotherapy alone. 
Meta-analyses comparing chemotherapy with chemoradia- 
tion showed no survival beneﬁt and increased toxicity for 
chemoradiotherapy compared to chemotherapy [16–18]. The 
combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin was compared 
with gemcitabine alone in locally advanced or metastatic 
pancreatic cancer in the GERGOR/GISCAD randomized 
trial. Despite an increased RR in locally advanced disease with 
gemcitabine/oxaliplatin compared to gemcitabine (27 vs. 
14 %), the overall survival was identical at 10.3 mo in both 
arms [7]. In a subsequent randomized ECOG trial comparing 
conventional gemcitabine, gemcitabine ﬁxed-dose rate (FDR) 
infusion, and gemcitabine/oxaliplatin in advanced pancreatic 
cancer, there was no difference in RR, PFS, or OS between any 
of the regimens, and the median survival was just 9.2 months 
in locally advanced disease [8]. 
Although FOLFIRINOX has superior efﬁcacy compared 
to gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic can- 
cer, there are limited data regarding its efﬁcacy and toler- 
ability in locally advanced pancreatic cancer. In the initial 
phase II trial of FOLFIRINOX, only 11 patients had locally 
advanced disease, and in these patients, the RR was 27 % 
and median OS was 15.7 mos [14]. In our cohort of 16 
patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer treated 
with FOLFIRINOX, we observed a response rate of 50 % 
and a disease control rate of 94 %, conﬁrming impressive 
efﬁcacy of FOLFIRINOX in locally advanced disease. The 
RR in our cohort of locally advanced pancreatic cancer is 
higher than that reported for gemcitabine-based regimens 
and is similar to the RR reported by Conroy et al. [15] in 
FOLFIRINOX-treated patients with metastatic disease. 
The PFS for locally advanced disease at 6 and 12 months 
was 94 and 77 %, respectively, and the OS at 6 and 
12 month was 94 and 83 %, respectively. Two of our 16 
patients with locally advanced disease were able to 
undergo resection, and one patient had near complete 



pathological response. Our ﬁndings suggest that the efﬁ- 
cacy and tolerability of FOLFIRINOX in locally advanced 
pancreatic cancer is similar to its efﬁcacy in the metastatic 
setting and support the use of FOLFIRINOX as initial 
therapy in patients with locally advanced or borderline 
disease. 

We report nine cases of acute onset of dysarthria and other 
neurological symptoms (facial or perioral paresthesias, leg 
cramps, ataxia, and blepharospasm) during the FOLFIRINOX 
infusion. The onset of these symptoms was temporally asso- 
ciated with the irinotecan infusion. In all cases, the symptoms 
resolved completely without speciﬁc intervention other than 
transient 
the irinotecan infusion and/or 
administration of anticholinergic agents (atropine or diphen- 
hydramine). In some cases, the symptoms recurred with re- 
initiation of the irinotecan infusion, but resolved with 
administration of anticholinergic agents. Neurotoxic effects of 
irinotecan are uncommon, and only four cases have been 
reported in the literature [19–22]. The mechanism by which 
CNS toxicity occurs after irinotecan infusion is not well 
understood. Harel et al. [23] proposed that irinotecan causes 
increased cholinergic activity by binding to the active site of 
acetylcholinesterase causing its functional inhibition. Cho- 
linergic receptors are found more in the brainstem nuclei and 
using cholinergic agents result in a surge of hypoglossal nerve 
activity [24, 25], which might explain the dysarthria associ- 
ated with irinotecan toxicity. This mechanism could be related 
to cholinergic oversensitivity of the neurons in the hypo- 
glossal nerve nucleus. Atropine has not been shown to prevent 
dysarthria, and all the reported cases showed that these 
symptoms were reversible and severity did not worsen upon 
re-challenging with irinotecan [26]. Since oxaliplatin is rou- 
tinely administered prior to irinotecan in the FOLFIRINOX 
regimen, we speculate that oxaliplatin may enhance the neu- 
rotoxic effects of irinotecan, thereby increasing the incidence 
of this rare side effect of irinotecan. 

In this single institution retrospective study, the routine use 
in con- 
of modest dose attenuations of FOLFIRINOX, 
junction with growth factor support, was associated with 
improved tolerability compared to full dose FOLFIRINOX 
as reported by Conroy et al. Our ﬁndings suggest that these 
modest dose attenuations do not reduce the efﬁcacy of 
FOLFIRINOX in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. 
Moreover, 
the efﬁcacy of FOLFIRINOX in locally 
advanced disease was comparable to its efﬁcacy in meta- 
static disease. Given the number of patients in our series 
and the limitations of a retrospective study, our ﬁndings 
require further substantiation. Prospective trials are needed 
to validate the efﬁcacy and tolerability of modiﬁcations of 

FOLFIRINOX in metastatic pancreatic cancer. In patients 
with locally advanced and borderline disease, we need to 
better deﬁne the activity of FOLFIRINOX and its role and 
safety in the neoadjuvant setting.
