Purpose. Limited data are available to guide neoadjuvant treatment of borderline resectable (BRPC) and locally 

 
advanced (LAPC) pancreatic cancer. 
Material and methods. We updated our institutional outcomes with a neoadjuvant chemotherapy and stereotactic 

 
body radiotherapy (SBRT) approach. An IRB-approved analysis was performed of all BRPC and LAPC patients treated 
with our departmental treatment protocol. After staging, medically ﬁ t patients underwent chemotherapy for 2 – 3 months, 
with regimen at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist. Patients then received SBRT delivered in ﬁ ve con- 
secutive daily fractions with median total radiation doses of 30 Gy to tumor and 40 Gy dose painted to tumor-vessel 
interfaces. This was followed by restaging imaging for possible resection. Overall survival (OS), event free survival 
(EFS), and locoregional control (LRC) rates were estimated and compared by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods. 
Results. We identiﬁ ed 159 patients, 110 BRPC and 49 LAPC, with 14.0 months median overall follow-up. The resec- 

 
tion and margin negative (R0) rate for BRPC patients who completed neoadjuvant therapy was 51% and 96%, respec- 
tively. Estimated median OS was 19.2 months for BRPC patients and 15.0 months for LAPC patients (p (cid:3) 0.402). Median 
OS was 34.2 months for surgically resected patients versus 14.0 months for unresected patients (p (cid:4) 0.001). Five of 21 
(24%) LAPC patients receiving FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy underwent R0 resection. In LAPC, FOLFIRINOX recip- 
ients underwent R0 resection more often than other chemotherapy recipients (5 of 21 vs. 0 of 28, p (cid:3) 0.011). There was 
a trend for improved survival in those resected LAPC patients (p (cid:3) 0.09). For those not undergoing resection, one year 
LRC was 78%. Any grade (cid:5) 3 potentially radiation-related toxicity rate was 7%. 
Conclusions. These data underscore the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of neoadjuvant SBRT and chemotherapy 

 
for BRPC and LAPC. 
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause 

 
of cancer death in the US [1]. For the most common 
exocrine cancers, patients who undergo tumor resec- 
tion have the best chance of cure, while unresectable 
cancers are nearly uniformly fatal [2]. Novel tech- 
niques are required to improve the survival and qual- 
ity of life of patients. 
Oneemerging technique for the treatment of 
 
pancreatic cancer is stereotactic body radiation ther- 
apy (SBRT). SBRT is used by specialized centers to 
deliver a high dose of precisely targeted radiation in 
a short course of therapy [3]. Unresectable locally 
advanced pancreatic cancers (LAPC) cause signiﬁ - 
cant pain, obstruction, and other morbidity due to 
direct extension of the primary tumor [4]. Utilized 
to slow tumor progression, some early SBRT experi- 
ences in LAPC of up to 85 patients have demon- 
strated local control (LC) rates over 80% at one year 
[5 – 8]. Borderline resectable pancreatic cancers 
(BRPC) involve nearby vasculature with elevated risk

for margin positive (R1) resection and are frequently 
treated to improve resectability [9,10]. Neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy and sequential SBRT with high dose 
to the area of tumor-vessel interface have been 
employed in BRPC with high rates of margin nega- 
tive (R0) resection [11,12]. 
Evolvingcombination chemotherapies are also 
 
improving outcomes in pancreatic cancer. Large 
randomized trials of the oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 
 uorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX) or 
ﬂ 
the gemcitabine with nab-paclitaxel 
regimens 
have demonstrated improved survival and radio- 
graphic response compared to single agent gemcit- 
abine [13,14]. The gemcitabine, docetaxel, and 
capecitabine (GTX) chemotherapy regimen has 
also been associated with promising radiographic 
responses [15]. 
Thesemulti-agent chemotherapy regimens are 
 
being applied to earlier stages of pancreatic cancer, 
often in sequential fashion with radiotherapy. Initial 
experiences with FOLFIRINOX and radiotherapy in 
BRPC and LAPC have demonstrated encouraging 
results [16 – 19]. The ongoing ALLIANCE-A021101 
trial seeks to evaluate in BRPC the safety and out- 
comes of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX followed by 
concurrent capecitabine and conventional radiation 
prior to resection with adjuvant gemcitabine. 
Thisreport updates the outcomes and toxicity 
 
using induction chemotherapy and SBRT for BRPC 
and LAPC in our institutional experience of 159 
patients. Several LAPC patients were able to undergo 
surgical resection after treatment, and this outcome 
was correlated with receipt of FOLFIRINOX che- 
motherapy. 
Material and methods 
 
Initial staging and patients 
 
Afterinstitutional review board approval, an internal 
 
database was queried to identify all patients who 
received at least one dose of induction chemotherapy 
and SBRT as part of our institutional protocol for 
the treatment of BRPC or LAPC. These patients 
were treated from 2009 to 2014 and had American 
Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition stage IIA-III 
adenosquamous or adenocarcinoma. Deﬁ nitions of 
anatomic resectability were applied from the 2009 
expert consensus statement which were adopted by 
the National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
(NCCN) [9]. 
Stagingmethods under this protocol have been 
 
previously described [7]. In summary, patients typi- 
cally undergo physical examination, standard blood 
chemistries including CA19-9, multidetector thin- 
slice pancreatic protocol computed tomography 
(CT) scan, positron emission tomography (PET) 
scan, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), specialist pathol- 
ogy review, and presentation at gastrointestional 
tumor board. The highest stage identiﬁ ed by any 
imaging modality determined the clinical stage and 
treatment. Included BRPC patients were initially 
judged ﬁ t to medically tolerate resection without 
probable distant metastases. Three clinically T2-T3 
classiﬁ cation patients judged unlikely to ever tolerate 
resection are included as LAPC patients. 
Chemotherapy treatment 
 
Patientsﬁ rst received induction chemotherapy at the 
 
discretion of the treating medical oncologist. For 
BRPC, patients most commonly received induction 
chemotherapy with three 21-day cycles of the GTX 
regimen as gemcitabine 750 mg/m 2 and docetaxel 
30 mg/m 2 intravenous (IV) on Days 4 and 11, and 
capecitabine 750 mg/m 2 orally twice daily on Days 1 
through 14. For LAPC, the most common induction 
regimen was six 14-day cycles of FOLFIRINOX as 
oxaliplatin 85 mg/m 2 , folinic acid 400 mg/m 2 , irino- 
tecan 180 mg/m 2 , ﬂ uorouracil, 400 mg/m 2 IV bolus 
Day 1, and ﬂ uorouracil 1200 mg/m 2 /day IV continu- 
ous 46-hour infusion on Days 1 – 2. Gemcitabine 
alone was most commonly given in three four-week 
cycles at 1000 mg/m 2 IV on Days 1, 8 and 15. Several 
patients received gemcitabine as above with the addi- 
tion of nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m 2 IV. 
Patientswere identiﬁ ed as receiving “ per proto- 
 
col ” for purposes of this study if they received che- 
motherapy for at least the number of cycles listed 
with less than one week of protocol interruption. 
Dose reductions were allowed for toxicities. 
Radiation treatment and restaging 
 
UnderEUS guidance, 2 – 4 ﬁ ducial markers were 
 
placed into the tumor [20]. A ﬂ uoroscopic study was 
then performed to gauge the amplitude of tumor 
motion by tracking the markers during respiration 
with an applied abdominal compression device. For 
tumor motion (cid:5) 1 cm, radiation treatment utilized 
respiratory gating by the Varian Real-Time Position 
Management system (Varian Medical Systems Inc., 
Palo Alto, CA, USA). Patients were immobilized by 
a BodyFix cradle (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden). Iso- 
center was then determined on non-contrast CT 
simulation scan followed by repeat four-dimensional 
CT with IV and oral contrast. 
SBRTbegan at least seven days after last chemo- 
 
therapy administration (median 20 days). Five con- 
secutive daily fractions were delivered by Varian 
Truebeam or Trilogy linear accelerator to gross tumor 
volume (GTV) within the pancreas plus motion with 
a 3 – 5mm planning tumor volume expansion. Intensity 
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was utilized 
to plan 28 – 30 Gy (median 30 Gy) to the planning 
tumor volume with simultaneous dose painting to up 
to 50 Gy (median 40 Gy) to areas of vessel involve- 
ment by tumor. Dose was limited by organs at risk as 
follows: for each of duodenum, small bowel, and 
stomach mean (cid:4) 20 Gy, volume receiving 30 Gy (V30) 
(cid:4)2 cm 3 , V35 Gy (cid:4) 0.5 cm 3 ; each kidney mean (cid:4) 10 
 
Gy, spinal cord maximum 20 Gy. 
Aftercompletion of radiation treatment, patients 
 
were restaged by repeat examination, pancreas pro- 
tocol CT, PET/CT, and multidisclipinary tumor 
board presentation. Patients were eligible for surgery 
if there continued to be no imaging evidence of dis- 
tant metastases, if they met criteria for resectable or 
borderline resectability, and if they were judged to be 
able to tolerate resection medically. 
Surgery and pathology 
 
Surgerywas usually performed 1 – 2 months after 
 
SBRT, and all patients except one underwent surgery 
within three months after SBRT. Patients with tumors 
of the pancreatic head underwent pancreaticoduo- 
denectomy. Tumors of the pancreatic body or tail 
were removed by distal pancreatectomy and splenec- 
tomy. Rare patients required total pancreatectomy 
due to concerns of diffuse tumor inﬁ ltration or 
numerous intraductal mucinous papillary neoplasms. 
A vascular surgeon was available when necessary for 
repair or resection of the superior mesenteric vein 
(SMV) or portal vein (PV). 
Pathologywas reported by pathologists with 
 
expertise in gastrointestinal pathology. College of 
American Pathology protocols were used for exami- 
nation, including tumor response grade used for 
response to neoadjuvant therapy [9]. Margin nega- 
tive was deﬁ ned as no tumor cells at the edge of the 
specimen. 
Follow-up and analysis 
 
Patientswere evaluated every 3 – 6 months for the 
 
 rst ﬁ ve years and yearly thereafter. All charts were 
ﬁ 
reviewed to identify outcomes and potentially radia- 
tion-related toxicity. Acute side effects were deﬁ ned 
as those occurring within 90 days of radiation treat- 
ment. Side effects were graded according to version 
4.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common Ter- 
minology Criteria for Adverse Events. 
Statisticaltesting was performed with IBM SPSS 
 
(IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0; 
IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Overall survival 
(OS), event free survival (EFS), and locoregional 
control (LRC) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier 
method and compared by the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) 

test, with time starting at the date of diagnosing 
biopsy. EFS was deﬁ ned as freedom from disease 
progression or death from any cause. 
 
 
Atotal of 159 patients, 110 BRPC and 49 LAPC, 
 
have been treated with the induction chemotherapy 
and SBRT protocol. Their characteristics are listed 
in Table I. GTX chemotherapy was given to 89 
(81%) BRPC patients, while FOLFIRINOX was 
most common (21 patients, 43%) in the LAPC 
group. Gemcitabine alone was prescribed to 17 
(35%) LAPC patients, usually due to concerns 
about the ability of individual patients to tolerate 
the FOLFIRINOX regimen. Of the 110 BRPC 
patients, 56 (51%) underwent curative intent resec- 
tion, while 46 (42%) patients became unresectable 
during neoadjuvant therapy due to local or distant 
progression. Another eight (7%) patients suffered 
decline in performance status that precluded resec- 
tion. Of the 49 LAPC patients, seven (14%) under- 
went surgical exploration based on performance 
status and imaging response suggestive of resect- 
ability, though two were found to be unresectable 
at exploration. 
Five(10%) LAPC patients underwent R0 resec- 
 
tion. It was observed that all ﬁ ve LAPC patients 
undergoing complete resection received FOL- 
FIRINOX chemotherapy per protocol (at least six, 
two-week cycles received within 84 days). The ﬁ ve 
patients represent 24% of the 21 FOLFIRINOX 
recipients and 36% of the 14 per protocol FOL- 
FIRINOX recipients. Table II demonstrates that 
when compared to other chemotherapy protocols, 
receipt of FOLFIRINOX was statistically signiﬁ cant 
for resection in these LAPC patients (p (cid:3) 0.011). 
Surgicaland pathologic outcomes are displayed 
 
in Table III. Vascular repair was required in 22 (36%) 
patients, though positive margins were only obtained 
in two (3%) patients. Despite clear evidence of dis- 
ease regression on imaging, LAPC patients who suc- 
cessfully underwent resection were found to either 
have moderate response (60%) or poor response 
(40%) by tumor response grade. There were four 
(7%) patients observed to have pathologic complete 
response (pCR). None of these patients have yet 
relapsed (EFS log-rank p (cid:3) 0.066 for pCR vs. any 
other response). 
Medianfollow-up was 14.0 months (range 4 – 46 
 
months) with median OS and EFS estimated at 18.1 
months and 12.7 months, respectively. Figure 1 
shows OS and EFS for BRPC and LAPC. Median 
OS and EFS were 19.2 months and 11.9 months in 
the BRPC group and 15.0 months and 13.2 months 
in the LAPC group (comparisons not signiﬁ cant).

Figure2 demonstrates the improved OS and EFS 
 
for patients undergoing resection (p (cid:4) 0.001 for 
both). Median OS and EFS were 34.2 months and 
23.1 months for the curative intent surgery group 
compared to median OS and EFS of 14.0 months 
and 9.5 months for patients not undergoing curative 
intent surgery. Median follow-up for patients under- 
going surgery who have not died was 20.3 months 
(range 6 – 46 months). The two patients with R1 
resections remain without evidence of disease at 6.8 
and 27.3 months after surgery. 
Forpatients not undergoing surgery, the 12 
 
month LRC rate was 78% and the 18 month LRC 
rate was 63%. In the LAPC patients undergoing sur- 
gery, there have been no deaths and one locoregional 
failure. Follow-up is limited in these patients (range 
2.1 – 15.4 months, median 5.6 months), however, a 
trend is observed towards improved survival for 
LAPC patients undergoing resection compared to no 
resection (log-rank p (cid:3) 0.09). 
Potentiallyradiation related grade (cid:5) 3 acute and/

The most common grade 3 or higher toxicity was

extension of tumor. This was controlled with endo- 
scopic techniques in all but one patient who elected 
for hospice care only. Any acute grade 1 – 2 toxicity 
was reported in 83 (52%) patients. Fatigue was 
most common (31%). Epigastric pain was reported 
by 23 (14%) patients, though opiates were required 
by only 12 (8%) patients. All toxicities are listed 
in Supplementary Table I (available online at 
http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/ 
0284186X.2015.1004367) with further detail reg- 
arding observed toxicities. 
 
 
Inthe present study, we demonstrate outcomes of all 
 
159 patients at our institution who received neoadju- 
vant chemotherapy and SBRT for the treatment of 
BRPC and LAPC pancreatic adenocarcinoma with 
median follow-up of 14 months. This represents the 
largest series of SBRT in pancreatic cancer to date. Of 
the 110 BRPC patients, 56 (51%) underwent curative- 
intent resection, with 96% R0 resection rate. Patients 
undergoing resection lived signiﬁ cantly longer than 
patients not undergoing resection. Out of 49 LAPC 
patients, ﬁ ve responded sufﬁ ciently on imaging to 
undergo negative margin resection after neoadjuvant 
treatment. These patients all received the FOL- 
FIRINOX regimen, with superior resection rate com- 
pared to gemcitabine-based regimens. Patients who did 
not undergo resection had a 78% LRC rate at one year. 
Grade (cid:5) 3 toxicity potentially attributable to radiation 
therapy was observed in only 11 (7%) of patients. 


 
 
 
 

Figure 2. (A) Kaplan-Meier estimated OS for all patients undergoing curative-intent surgical resection compared to those without curative- 

 
intent surgery. (B) Kaplan-Meier estimated EFS for the same patients. 
Thedata presented here compares similarly in 
 
some respects to our earlier series of 73 patients 
receiving induction chemotherapy and SBRT with 
10.5 months of median follow-up, though there are 
several signiﬁ cant advancements [7]. The median 
radiation doses to tumor and tumor-vessel abutment 
escalated from 25 Gy and 35 Gy, to 30 Gy and 
40 Gy, respectively, with minimal change in signiﬁ - 
cant toxicity rate. The prior series identiﬁ ed no LAPC 
patients undergoing resection after neoadjuvant treat- 
ment. Since that publication, the number of LAPC 
patients tripled, with a higher proportion receiving 
FOLFIRINOX. The median follow-up time is longer 
in this study, and particularly the maximum follow-up 
time in this study is nearly doubled to 46 months. 
This particularly impacts median OS estimates for 
the longest lived patients. Previously, the median OS 
in the surgically resected group was estimated at 19.2 
months, however, very few patients had follow-up to 
that time, making the estimate inaccurate. Median 
OS for the surgically resected patients is now esti- 
mated to be 34.2 months, which still has the potential 
to be underestimated due to follow-up time. 
Thisstudy is comparable in size and outcomes to 
 
the 2008 report of BRPC by Katz et al. which 
included 125 patients who completed neoadjuvant 
conventional chemoradiotherapy for BRPC, albeit 
with a different deﬁ nition for borderline resectability 
than that used here [21]. In their study, 66 (53%) 
patients underwent curative intent resection after 
neoadjuvant treatment, with 94% R0 resection rate 
and 6% pathologic complete response. Further, the 
median OS in their series was 40 months for resected 
patients, 13 months for patients not undergoing 
resection, and 18 months for all patients. This is 
similar to the results of the current study as follows: 
34.2 months for resected patients, 11.3 months for 
BRPC and LAPC patients not undergoing resection, 
and 19.2 months for all BRPC patients. 
Completesurgical resections of LAPC after neo- 
 
adjuvant therapy with single agent chemotherapy 
and radiation have been reported in only 1 – 5% of 
LAPC patients in large series [22,23]. However, sev- 
eral recent publications have reported more frequent 
downstaging of LAPC with FOLFIRINOX. Hosein 
et al. recently published their series of 18 LAPC 
patients receiving FOLFIRINOX [16]. At maximum 
response or tolerability, ﬁ ve underwent R0 resection. 
Of the remainder, three patients later underwent R0 
resection after further chemoradiotherapy for an 
impressive 44% overall resection rate. Faris et al. also 
reported their initial experience of FOLFIRINOX 
followed by conventional chemoradiotherapy in 22 
LAPC patients and resection rate of 23% was 
achieved. Here we demonstrate ﬁ ve (24%) patients 
resected after FOLFIRINOX and SBRT compared 
with no resected LAPC patients of 28 treated 
with gemcitabine-based regimens and SBRT. To our 
knowledge, this work is the ﬁ rst to suggest superior- 
ity of FOLFIRINOX compared to other chemother- 
apy regimens in converting LAPC to resectability. 
Given the trend towards improved survival for surgi- 
cally resected LAPC patients, prospective study 
is warranted to evaluate the superiority of FOL- 
FIRINOX compared to gemcitabine-based regimens 
in the neoadjuvant setting. 
 
 
Theinduction chemotherapy and SBRT protocol was 
 
applied to the largest series to date (n (cid:3) 159) of BRPC 
and LAPC patients with 51% resection rate for BRPC

patients and 24% resection rate for LAPC patients 
who received FOLFIRINOX. The size and follow-up 
rivals the largest single institution series of BRPC 
patients receiving conventional neoadjuvant chemo- 
radiotherapy. While patient numbers are limited in the 
current study, FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy was 
associated with a higher resection rate in LAPC than 
gemcitabine-based regimens. At 14.0 months of 
median follow-up, signiﬁ cant OS beneﬁ t was identi- 
 ed for patients undergoing surgery, and trend for OS 
ﬁ 
was identiﬁ ed for the subgroup of LAPC patients 
undergoing surgery. One year LRC was 78% in those 
patients not undergoing surgery. Grade (cid:5) 3 poten- 
tially radiation-related toxicity rate was only 7%. This 
data underscores the feasibility, safety, and effective- 
ness of SBRT-based regimens for BRPC and LAPC.
