Purpose 
To evaluate response rate and toxicity of irinotecan and oxaliplatin plus ﬂuorouracil (FU) and 
leucovorin (Folﬁrinox) in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (APA). 
Patients and Methods 
Chemotherapy-naive patients with histologically proven APA and bidimensionally measur- 
able disease were treated with Folﬁrinox therapy every 2 weeks, which comprised oxaliplatin 
85 mg/m2 and irinotecan 180 mg/m2 plus leucovorin 400 mg/m2 followed by bolus FU 400 
mg/m2 on day 1, then FU 2,400 mg/m2 as a 46-hour continuous infusion. Quality of life (QOL) 
was assessed using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of 
Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). 
Results 
Forty-seven patients were entered, and 46 received treatment. Thirty-ﬁve patients (76%) had 
metastatic disease. A total of 356 cycles were delivered, with a median of eight cycles per 
patient (range, one to 24 cycles). All patients were assessable for safety. No toxic death 
occurred. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 52% of patients, including two patients with 
febrile neutropenia. Other relevant toxicities included grade 3 to 4 nausea (20%), vomiting 
(17%), and diarrhea (17%) and grade 3 neuropathy (15%; Levi’s scale). The conﬁrmed 
response rate was 26% (95% CI, 13% to 39%), including 4% complete responses. Median 
time to progression was 8.2 months (95% CI, 5.3 to 11.6 months), and median overall 
survival was 10.2 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 14.4 months). Between baseline and end of 
treatment, patients had improvement in all functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30, except 
cognitive functioning. Responders had major improvement in global QOL. 
Conclusion 
With a good safety proﬁle, a promising response rate, and an improvement in QOL, Folﬁrinox 
will be further assessed in a phase III trial. 

Pancreatic cancer ranks as the fourth leading 
cause of cancer deaths in the Western world. 
There are an estimated 30,000 deaths in the 
United States1 and 50,000 deaths per year in 
Europe.2 Because of the aggressiveness of pan- 
creatic cancers and the lack of effective sys- 
temic therapies, only 1% to 4% of patients 
with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas will be 
alive 5 years after diagnosis.1,3 Advanced pan- 
creatic adenocarcinoma (APA) remains an in- 
curable disease with few good treatment 
two randomized trials 
options. However,

demonstrated that chemotherapy improves both survival and 
quality of life (QOL) compared with best supportive care 
(BSC).4,5 A randomized trial comparing gemcitabine with 30- 
minute infusion ﬂuorouracil (FU) demonstrated a modest 
signiﬁcant survival advantage for the gemcitabine group.6 Sev- 
eral attempts at developing more efﬁcacious gemcitabine- 
based regimens have been carried out, but despite encouraging 
results from phase II trials, randomized studies to date have 
not shown a survival beneﬁt for combination chemotherapy 
over gemcitabine alone.7-15 Therefore, new effective and well- 
tolerated regimens are warranted. 
Irinotecan, a camptothecin analog, has been demon- 
strated to have a higher growth inhibitory effect against cul- 
tured pancreatic adenocarcinoma than cisplatin, mitomycin, 
and FU.16 Preclinical studies have indicated a synergy when 
irinotecan precedes FU-leucovorin exposure.17-19 Other stud- 
ies have shown high activity of irinotecan on pancreatic tumor 
cells in culture and in xenografts.20,21 Irinotecan has been 
investigated as a single agent in patients with nonpre- 
treated APA, producing response rates from 9% to 
27%.22-24 Some activity as second-line chemotherapy has 
also been reported.25,26 
Oxaliplatin, a platinum-based drug, also inhibits pan- 
creatic tumor cell lines.27 When used as a single agent, 
oxaliplatin has minimal activity against APA, but a 10% 
response rate has been described when it was used with 
FU.28 In vitro, synergistic activity has been described be- 
tween irinotecan and oxaliplatin.29,30 Differences in mech- 
anism of action of oxaliplatin and irinotecan, combined 
with the demonstrated antitumor activity of each agent, 
suggest that coadministration of oxaliplatin and irinotecan 
to patients with APA may provide clinical outcomes superior 
to those obtained with either drug administered alone. Fur- 
thermore, with the exception of myelosuppression and diar- 
rhea, the two drugs have no overlapping clinical toxicity. 
One previous phase I trial31 evaluated a triplet combi- 
nation of leucovorin plus bolus and continuous-infusion 
FU (LV5FU),32 irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. The recom- 
mended doses were oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, irinotecan 180 
mg/m2, and full doses of simpliﬁed LV5FU. Of ﬁve patients 
with APA, one complete response (CR) and one partial 
response (PR) were observed. On the basis of these encour- 
aging results, a multicenter phase II study of the oxaliplatin 
and irinotecan plus LV5FU combination (Folﬁrinox) was 
conducted by the Gastrointestinal Tumor Group of the 
French Anticancer Centers. The main objectives were to 
assess the efﬁcacy and safety of the Folﬁrinox combination 
as ﬁrst-line treatment in patients with APA. 

Eligible patients were required to have histologically or cyto- 
logically proven APA, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic 
disease, at least one bidimensionally measurable lesion according 
to WHO criteria,33 no previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, an 
age between 18 and 70 years, a WHO performance status (PS) less 
than 2, and adequate bone marrow, liver (total bilirubin (cid:1) 1.5 (cid:1) 
the upper limits of normal [ULN], AST and ALT (cid:1) 3 (cid:1) UNL, and 
alkaline phosphatases (cid:2) 3 (cid:1) ULN or (cid:2) 5 (cid:1) ULN in case of liver 
involvement), and renal function (creatinine (cid:2) 130 (cid:2)mol/L). 
Surgical unresectability was deﬁned by laparotomy or by multidis- 
ciplinary consultation looking at radiologic criteria as extrapan- 
creatic disease or celiac or superior mesenteric artery involvement. 
Written informed consent was required, and the ethical commit- 
tee approved the study. Patients with CNS metastases, second 
malignancies, and a history of chronic diarrhea, angina pectoris, 
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria grade 
greater than 1 peripheral neuropathy, or psychiatric disorders 
were excluded. 

Folﬁrinox consisted of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 diluted in 5% 
dextrose administered as a 2-hour intravenous infusion followed 
by irinotecan 180 mg/m2 administered as a 90-minute infusion in 
dextrose 5% 500 mL or normal saline 1 hour after the end of 
oxaliplatin infusion. The simpliﬁed LV5FU regimen was adminis- 
tered after the irinotecan infusion as follows: leucovorin 400 
mg/m2 over 2 hours followed by FU 400 mg/m2 bolus, then FU 
2,400 mg/m2 was administered as a 46-hour continuous infusion. 
Treatment cycles were repeated every 2 weeks. 
Antiemetic prophylaxis was left to investigator’s discretion. 
In case of severe cholinergic syndrome, preventive treatment with 
atropine (0.25 mg subcutaneously) was to be administered at all 
subsequent cycles. If patients experienced delayed diarrhea, early 
high-dose loperamide was prescribed according to speciﬁc guide- 
lines, and if diarrhea persisted more than 48 hours, prophylactic 
oral ﬂuoroquinolones were administered. In case of severe neutro- 
penia and/or no recovery to grade less than 1 at day 14, further 
cycles could be administered with a granulocyte colony- 
stimulating factor (G-CSF). 
Patients were assessed for toxicity before each cycle. Chemo- 
therapy was delayed until recovery if neutrophils were less than 
1.5 (cid:1) 109/L or platelets were less than 100 (cid:1) 109/L. Doses adjust- 
ments were made according to nadir values and time of recovery to 
a grade (cid:1) 1. Doses reductions were also recommended in case of 
grade 3 to 4 diarrhea, stomatitis, hand and foot syndrome, and 
vomiting and/or in case of grade 2 peripheral neuropathy. For any 
other nonhematologic toxicity that occurred with grade (cid:3) 2, a 
maximum delay of treatment of 2 weeks was allowed to attempt 
recovery to grade (cid:1) 1. Once the dose was decreased, re-escalation 
was not permitted. Patients went off study if they required more 
than two dose reductions. 
Treatment was continued until disease progression, unac- 
ceptable toxicity, or patient refusal. Twelve cycles were recom- 
mended in responding patients, and patients were observed every 
3 months until death or cutoff date. 

The primary efﬁcacy end point was response rate, which was 
deﬁned as the sum of CR and PR assessed according to WHO 
criteria.33 CR was deﬁned as the complete disappearance of all 
assessable disease, and PR was deﬁned as a decrease of at least 50% 
of the sum of the products of the diameters of measurable lesions. 
Responses had to be conﬁrmed by repeat assessments performed 
no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were ﬁrst met.

Stable disease was deﬁned as a decrease of less than 50% or an 
increase of less than 25% in measurable lesions, and progressive 
disease was deﬁned as an increase of at least 25% in measurable 
lesions or the appearance of new malignant lesion(s). Computed 
tomography scan imaging was performed at baseline and then 
every 6 weeks until disease progression. Patients who were with- 
drawn from study before the ﬁrst evaluation were classiﬁed as 
having experienced treatment failure. All computed tomography 
scans were reviewed by an external response review committee 
(ERRC), which was a panel of two independent radiologists not 
involved in the study. Secondary efﬁcacy end points included the 
duration of response and stabilization, time to progression, and 
overall survival. Time to progression was calculated from the start 
of treatment to the ﬁrst day of progression. Survival lasted from 
the date of inclusion until death. 

Patients who received at least one infusion were assessable for 
safety. For hematologic and biologic parameters, at least one mea- 
sure per cycle was required. Toxic effects (except paresthesias) 
were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxic- 
ity Criteria version 1.0. Peripheral sensitive neuropathy was 
graded according to Levi’s speciﬁc grading.34 

QOL was assessed using the European Organisation for Re- 
search and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 
(EORTC QLQ-C30, version 3.0). The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30- 
item questionnaire including ﬁve functional scales, three symp- 
tom scales, one QOL scale, and six single items on common 
symptoms.35 The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire was distrib- 
uted to the patients before each cycle and at the end of the treat- 
ment. Questionnaires were scored according to the EORTC 
instructions.36 Baseline and last available questionnaires were 
compared. The primary objective was to analyze changes in global 
QOL, and secondary objectives were to describe changes in fa- 
tigue, pain, physical functioning, and emotional functioning. 
These scales were chosen because they are the most deteriorated in 
APA patients according to the EORTC reference values manual.37 
Clinical beneﬁt response was evaluated according to assessment of 
consumption of pain-relieving drugs, weight trends, or evolution 
of asthenia or anorexia. 

According to a Simon two-stage phase II optimal design38 for 
a goal of 25% true response rate with an (cid:4)and (cid:5)error probability 
of .05 and .20, respectively, an accrual of at least 40 eligible patients 
assessable for response was planned. Assuming that 15% of pa- 
tients would be inassessable, 46 patients needed to be included. An 
early termination of the study was required if less than three 
responses were observed in the ﬁrst 22 patients. Otherwise, re- 
cruitment continued. The 95% CI for response was calculated. 
Time-related parameters, including median follow-up time, were 
analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.39,40 

From June 2000 to June 2002, 47 patients were enrolled 
at nine French centers. One patient was never treated be- 
cause of sudden onset of icterus. The baseline characteris- 
tics of the 46 treated patients are listed in Table 1. The 
median age was 56 years (range, 40 to 69 years), and 76% of 
patients had stage IVb disease at diagnosis. Among 11 pa- 
tients with locally advanced disease, two patients had celiac 
artery involvement, one patient had local recurrence, and 
eight patients had unresectable tumor assessed during ex- 
plorative laparotomy. Thirty-four patients (74%) had an 
impaired PS, and 39 patients (85%) were suffering at least 
from one disease-related symptom at study entry. 

A total of 356 cycles were completed (median, eight 
cycles per patient; range, one to 24 cycles). Doses reductions 
were required in 50 cycles (14%), and the main reasons for 
dose reduction were hematologic toxicity, neurotoxicity, 
and diarrhea (Table 2). Short treatment delays ((cid:2) 7 days) 
occurred in 48 cycles (13%), and longer delays ((cid:3) 7 days) 
occurred in 66 cycles (19%). Those delays were mainly a

result of at least one hematologic toxicity (76 cycles, 67%). 
In 25 cycles (22%), delays were unrelated to study treat- 
ment. The delivered relative dose-intensity per patient was 
82% for oxaliplatin, 84% for irinotecan, and 83% for FU. 

Response rate was evaluated in all treated patients. 
After the ﬁrst 22 assessable patients were treated, four con- 
ﬁrmed objective responses were observed and, thus, accrual 
could continue. Overall results are listed in Table 3. Twelve 
PRs (26%) and 18 stabilizations (39%) were observed by the 
investigators, resulting in an overall response rate of 26% 
(95% CI, 13% to 39%). Three (27.3%) of 11 patients with 
local APA and nine of 35 patients with metastatic disease 
achieved a conﬁrmed response. This was conﬁrmed by the 
ERRC, with two CRs (4%), 10 PRs (22%), and 16 patients 
with stable disease (35%). With a median follow-up of 33 
months, the median response duration was 10.4 months 
(95% CI, 9.0 to 15.2 months), and median progression-free

survival (PFS) was 5.6 months (95% CI, 3.4 to 9.0 months) 
according to the investigators. According to the ERRC, 
median response duration was 9.3 months (95% CI, 8.2 to 
13.6 months), median PFS was 8.2 months (95% CI, 5.3 to 
11.6 months), and median duration of stable disease was 7.5 
months (95% CI, 5.1 to 15.1 months). When tumor pro- 
gressed, 31 patients (67%) received a second-line treat- 
ment, including gemcitabine (n (cid:4) 18), radiochemotherapy 
(n (cid:4) 4), Folﬁri (irinotecan, bolus- and continuous-infusion 
FU; n (cid:4) 3), gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (n (cid:4) 1), Folfox 
(oxaliplatin, bolus- and continuous-infusion FU; n (cid:4) 1), 
and FU-leucovorin (n (cid:4) 1). After having stopped chemo- 
therapy, three patients who responded to Folﬁrinox re- 
ceived Folﬁrinox again when they progressed. 
Median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI, 8.1 
to 14.4 months); in metastatic patients, the median overall 
survival was 9.5 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 13.7 months, and in 
locally advanced patients, it was 15.7 months (95% CI, 8.9 
to 43 months). The 1-year survival rate was 43% for the 
whole group (Fig 1). Six patients (including three patients 
with metastatic disease) are still alive, with a mean 
follow-up of (cid:5)30 months (range, (cid:5)26 to (cid:5)33 months). 

All treated patients (n (cid:4) 46) were assessable for safety, 
and no treatment-related deaths occurred. Grade 3 to 4 
toxicities are listed in Table 4. The most common toxicity 
was hematologic, with 52% of patients experiencing a grade 
3 or 4 neutropenia in 22% of cycles. Grade 4 febrile neutro- 
penia occurred in two patients (4%) without growth factors 
support. Overall, four patients received G-CSF for 12 cycles. 
The other grade 3 or 4 treatment-related hematologic tox- 
icities were anemia and thrombocytopenia, which occurred 
in 18% and 6% of patients, respectively. 
Nonhematologic toxicities of grade 3 to 4 occurred in 
less than 5% of cycles. Grades 3 and 4 vomiting was ob- 
served in 20% and 17% of patients, respectively, and grades 
3 and 4 asthenia occurred in 20% and 2% of patients,

respectively. Diarrhea led to hospitalization for four pa- 
tients. Thirteen percent and 15% of patients experienced 
grades 2 and 3 peripheral neuropathy, respectively, leading 
to study discontinuation for seven patients (15%). 

Among all patients, 256 (65.8%) of a possible 389 
EORTC QLQ-C30 forms were completed. For eight pa- 
tients (17%), no baseline questionnaire was available. There 
was no difference between the overall population and the 38 
patients who completed the baseline questionnaires regard- 
ing sex ratio, PS, median age, and disease stage. Two pa- 
tients who had completed the baseline questionnaire failed 
to complete further forms. Patients with objective response 
and those with minor response (n (cid:4) 5) were classiﬁed as 
responders (n (cid:4) 14) for the QOL analysis and were com- 
pared to patients with stable (n (cid:4) 12) or progressive disease 
(n (cid:4) 12). Median scores at baseline and at the end of study 
treatment are listed in Table 5 together with the percentage 
of patients with 10 points in degradation or improvement of 
each scores. 
Regarding the primary QOL end point, global QOL 
scores deteriorated in 18.8% of the patients, and 37.5% 
reported a moderate improvement ((cid:3) 10 points). Of note, 
the global QOL score was improved by 25 points in re- 
sponders, a major improvement according to the criteria of 
Osoba et al.41 The scores of the secondary QOL objectives of 
fatigue, pain, and physical and emotional functioning im- 
proved by more of 10 points in 36%, 53%, 21%, and 36% of 
the patients, respectively. Changes in global QOL scores 
were associated with treatment response (P (cid:4) .003). Global 
QOL scores at baseline were not predictive of treatment 
outcome (P (cid:4) .54).

(cid:1)High score (cid:4) high level of functioning. 
†High score (cid:4) high level of symptoms. 
Median scores of all functional scales improved during 
treatment, except cognitive functioning. Most symptoms 
such as pain, dyspnea, appetite loss, and constipation de- 
creased under treatment except diarrhea. Fatigue and nau- 
sea were unchanged. 
APA remains an incurable disease, and weekly gemcitabine 
has been widely adopted today as the standard of care in 
ﬁrst-line chemotherapy for APA, with median survival lim- 
ited to the range of 4.6 to 6.6 months in randomized 
studies.7-10,12,14,15,42-45 Multivariate Cox regression analysis 
identiﬁed prognostic factors for survival, mainly PS, extent 
of disease (nonmetastatic v metastatic), albumin level, lac- 
tate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatases, age, tumor dif- 
ferentiation, and appetite loss.7,43,44,46 Until now, no 
randomized trial has shown a signiﬁcant QOL beneﬁt or 
overall survival superiority for any gemcitabine-based com- 
bination over gemcitabine alone.7-15,43 Therefore, better 
systemic therapies are warranted. 
In this study, we offered Folﬁrinox for good PS patients 
(Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS of 0 and 1). Pa- 
tients with Karnofsky PS less than 70 have a short median 
survival (eg, 2.4 months when treated with gemcitabine)47 
and were not eligible for this potentially toxic regimen. In 
this selected population, Folﬁrinox regimen seems promis- 
ing and has a favorable tolerance proﬁle. Despite a high rate 
of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (52% of patients, 22% per 
cycle), only two cases of febrile neutropenia occurred. He- 
matologic toxicities resulted in 9% of cycles with dose re- 
duction and 21% delayed cycles. These results may be 
improved with a larger use of G-CSF because only three 
patients received prophylactic G-CSF. The other toxicities 
were manageable, and no toxic deaths occurred. 
Because of a frequent desmoplastic reaction in APA, 
tumor response assessment is difﬁcult, especially in locally 
advanced disease. However, there was no major difference 
between the investigators and the ERRC conclusions. The 
encouraging response rate of 26% (CI 95%, 13% to 39%) 
with Folﬁrinox was similar in locally advanced disease 
(27.3%) and in metastatic disease (25.7%). In our study, all 
responses were conﬁrmed by a second assessment and were 
independently reviewed. Two CRs, a rare event in APA, 
were observed (durations of 11 and 12 months). The overall 
response duration of 9.3 months (CI 95%, 8.2 to 13.6 
months) is also encouraging. The overall tumor growth 
control was 61%, with a duration of 9.3 months (CI 95%, 
7.8 to 11.7 months). Although second-line chemotherapy is 
often considered ineffective in APA, it was offered to 67% of 
patients, and one can not completely rule out some clinical 
impact resulting in an improved survival.

Patient QOL can be greatly reduced by side effects of 
chemotherapy or symptoms of APA, which include severe 
pain, depression, weight loss, loss of appetite, and fatigue. 
QOL was measured in our study with the EORTC QLQ- 
C30. As in all studies, the major problem with QOL assess- 
ment was the compliance, and eight questionnaires were 
lacking at baseline. However, the attrition rate was low, and 
at the end of treatment, data were available for all patients 
except two. All functional scales improved during treat- 
ment, except cognitive functioning. The greatest improve- 
ment in median scores was seen for role functioning, social 
functioning, and global QOL. Responders had the greatest 
improvement, with a median improvement of 25 points in 
global QOL, which is a major change according to Osoba 
criteria.41 The median score of fatigue remained stable, and 
pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, and constipation 
were improved. The only item that deteriorated during 
treatment was diarrhea. 
Until now, few studies have demonstrated a QOL im- 
provement with chemotherapy in APA. In 1996, Glimelius 
et al5 reported on 53 patients randomly assigned to receive 
chemotherapy (FU and leucovorin with or without etopo- 
side) plus BSC or BSC alone. Changes in EORTC QLQ-C30 
were categorized by two assessors who were unaware of the 
patient group assignment. Eleven patients (38%) were con- 
sidered to have a favorable QOL outcome in the chemother- 
apy group compared with three patients (13%) in the BSC 
group. However, the sample size was small, and the QOL 
evaluation was limited to the ﬁrst 4 months. Most of the 
further studies showed a rapid degradation in QOL during 
chemotherapy, probably mostly because of tumor pro- 
gression. In only one study, global QOL at 24 weeks was 
signiﬁcantly superior to the pretreatment value with a FU- 
mitomycin combination.46 The pain and dyspnea scores 
were also improved. Two studies have formally assessed 
QOL during gemcitabine treatment. Results are contradic- 
tory, with improvement of QOL in one study8 and worsen- 
ing of QOL at 4 and 8 weeks in another.44 
Other trials have assessed irinotecan or oxaliplatin in 
APA. The combination of gemcitabine plus irinotecan is 
active in APA.48 A randomized phase III study comparing 
gemcitabine alone to gemcitabine-irinotecan was recently 
published.12 The conﬁrmed response rate was signiﬁcantly 
better in the two-drug regimen than with gemcitabine alone 
(16.1% v 4.4%, respectively; P (cid:2) .001). However, there was 
no difference in PFS, overall survival, and QOL. The efﬁcacy 
of oxaliplatin was tested in a three-arm randomized phase II 
study comparing oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2, FU 1 g/m2/d con- 
tinuous infusion for 4 days, and the two drugs combined; 
the response rates were 0%, 0%, and 10% respectively. 
Tolerance was excellent, and the median survival of 9 
months in the oxaliplatin-FU arm was encouraging.28 
Sixty-two patients were treated in a Groupe d’Etude et 
de Recherche Clinique en Oncologie et Radiothérapie 
(GERCOR) phase II study with a ﬁxed dose-rate infusion of 
gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 as a 10 mg/m2/min infusion on 
day 1 and oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 on day 2 every 2 weeks 
(Gemox). The response rate was 30.6%.49 Using 3-week 
Gemox schedule, the North Central Cancer Treatment 
Group50 had a response rate of only 10.9%. The differences 
in these results suggest that the manner in which the drugs 
are administered inﬂuences the regimen’s efﬁcacy. An on- 
going three-arm phase III study by the Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group will better clarify both the beneﬁts of the 
ﬁxed dose-rate infusion of gemcitabine and the added ben- 
eﬁt of oxaliplatin. A randomized phase III study comparing 
the GERCOR’s Gemox combination to standard weekly 
gemcitabine was recently presented.11 Of 313 eligible pa- 
tients, the response rate according the investigators was 
26.8% for the Gemox combination versus 17.3% for gem- 
citabine alone (P (cid:4) .02); PFS was 5.8 and 3.7 months, 
respectively (P (cid:4) .038). However, no signiﬁcant increase in 
survival was observed, and QOL was not measured. 
In conclusion, the Folﬁrinox regimen seems promising 
for good PS patients. The objective response rate was 26%, 
including two CRs, and tumor control was achieved in 61% 
of patients. The median duration of response (9.3 months) 
and the median survival (10.2 months) are encouraging. 
Toxicity, which was mainly hematologic, was manageable, 
and an improvement in almost all the EORTC QLQ-C30 
QOL domains was observed. This investigational combina- 
tion is now tested in an ongoing phase II to III trial versus 
gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
