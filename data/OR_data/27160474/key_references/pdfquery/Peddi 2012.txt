ABSTRACT 
Context Combination chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin) was shown to be 
effective in a large phase III trial. Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the tolerance and effectiveness of 
FOLFIRINOX as practiced outside of the confines of a clinical trial and to document any dose modifications used by practicing 
oncologists. Methods Data on patients with all stages of pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with FOLFIRINOX at three institutions 
was analyzed for efficacy, tolerance, and use of any dose modifications. Results Total of 61 patients was included in this review. 
Median age was 58 years (range: 37 to 72 years), 33 were male (54.1%) and majority had ECOG performance of 0 or 1 (86.9%, 53 
patients). Thirty-eight (62.3%) had metastatic disease, while 23 (37.7%) were treated for locally advanced or borderline resectable 
disease. Patients were treated with a median number of four cycles of FOLFIRINOX, with dose modifications in 58.3% (176/302) of 
all cycles. Ten patients had stable disease (16.4%), four had a partial response (6.6%) while eight had progressive disease (13.1%) on 
best imaging following therapy. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 7.5 months and 13.5 months, 
respectively. The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was neutropenia at 19.7% (12 cases), with 4.9% (3 cases) rate of febrile 
neutropenia. Twenty-one patients (34.4%) were hospitalized as a result of therapy but there were no therapy-related deaths. Twenty- 
three (37.7%) had therapy eventually discontinued as a result of adverse events. Conclusion Despite substantial rates of adverse 
events and use of dose modifications, FOLFIRINOX was found to be clinically effective in both metastatic and non-metastatic 
patients. Regimen toxicity did not detract from overall response and survival. 



Pancreatic cancer remains the fourth leading cause of 
cancer death in the U.S. with an estimated 37,390 
this 
deaths 
malignancy has been slow with five year overall 
survival improving from 3% in 1970s to merely 6% in 
the early 2000s 
the only 
[1]. Until 
chemotherapy shown to provide a modest survival 
benefit had been gemcitabine, which improved median 
overall survival from 4.4 to 5.6 months when compared 
to fluorouracil in a landmark phase III study [2]. 
Attempts at improving survival with combination of 
gemcitabine and a variety of cytotoxic and molecularly 
targeted agents have failed to provide substantial 
additional benefit [3, 4, 5]. Addition of erlotinib to 
gemcitabine was the only combination to provide a 
modest additional survival benefit of 6% at 1 year, 
resulting in an FDA approval for this agent [6].

number of cycles received was recorded. 




ll clinic notes were reviewed for any hospitalizations, 
dose reductions or cessation of treatment due to 
adverse events. Laboratory values before and after each 
treatment cycle were also reviewed to corroborate and 
document any additional adverse events using 
complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic 
panel in each patient. Adverse events were graded 
using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE, version 3.0) 
[9]. Most common adverse events 
specifically 
tabulated in the paper include neutropenia, neutropenic 
fever, 
thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, nausea, 
abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Patients who received at 
least one cycle of chemotherapy were included for 
toxicity evaluation. 

taging imaging (CT or MRI) was obtained per the 
discretion of treating oncologists during treatment. 
These images were analyzed according to the Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) as 
described in the supplement of the ACCORD trial to 
determine response [7]. Images were included in 
response analysis if patients had received at least three 
cycles of a standard or modified FOLFIRINOX 
regimen prior to image acquisition. Original report by 
radiology was used for patients treated at Mayo Clinic 
and University of Wisconsin. An

(ACCORD 11/PRODIGE 4) trial on FOLFIRINOX, as 
the first regimen to improve the median overall 
survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer 
beyond 10 months [7]. FOLFIRINOX, consisting of a 
irinotecan, 
biweekly 
fluorouracil, and leucovorin, was compared in a phase 
II to III converted trial with gemcitabine in 342 patients 
in various European centers. Median overall survival 
was 11.1 months compared with 6.8 months in the 
gemcitabine group. Furthermore, in spite of higher 
rates of adverse events, patients in the FOLFIRINOX 
group reported a higher quality of life. 
In spite of the improvement in survival, however, 
acceptance of FOLFIRINOX has been tempered with 
toxicity concerns of this potent regimen. A similar 
regimen (FOLFOXIRI: irinotecan 165 mg/m2 day 1 
instead of 180 mg/m2 in FOLFIRINOX, same dose of 
oxaliplatin at 85 mg/m2 day 1, leucovorin at 200 mg/m2 
day 1, and fluorouracil at 3,200 mg/m2 48-hour 
continuous 
in 
FOLFIRINOX) was tried in colon cancer and has not 
been widely accepted partly due to similar toxicity 
concerns [8]. We therefore sought to document the use 
of FOLFIRINOX and its efficacy and tolerance in 
patients treated at three U.S. academic institutions 
within the framework of a registry study. 








at 
Washington University in St. Louis Siteman Cancer 
Center, Mayo Clinic, and University of Wisconsin 
Carbone Cancer Center, who were 
treated with 
FOLFIRINOX between January 2009 and April 2012, 
were eligible for 
inclusion. A retrospective and 
prospective registry was established to capture all 
patients after 
(IRB) 
approval was obtained at each institution. Patients were 
18 years of age or older and had pathologically 
confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Treatment with 
at least one cycle of a regimen consisting of 5- 
fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan was required 
for entry into the registry. Patients with all stages of 
pancreatic cancer and prior treatment histories were 
eligible. Demographic data collected included age, 
race, gender, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance status, stage at initiation of 
FOLFIRINOX, and any prior treatments. Baseline 
laboratory values were recorded

2012. 



regimen has been 
previously described in the ACCORD 11 trial [7], 
consisting of oxaliplatin at 85 mg/m2, leucovorin at 400 
mg/m2, irinotecan at 180 mg/m2, and fluorouracil at 
400 mg/m2, followed by a continuous fluorouracil 
intravenous infusion of 2,400 mg/m2 over a 46-hour 




received a median of 4 cycles of 
FOLFIRINOX with range of 1 to 22 cycles. Average 
number of cycles was 5.4. Three patients started with 
one cycle of FOLFOX (same dosage and schedule of 
oxaliplatin, 5-FU, and leucovorin as FOLFIRINOX, 
but omitting irinotecan) to test tolerability before the 
addition of irinotecan. This first cycle of FOLFOX was 
not counted towards cycle count or analysis. 
The FOLFIRINOX regimen was modified in 31 
patients (50.8%) empirically starting with the first 
cycle. Deletion of 5-FU and dose reduction of 
irinotecan were the most common modifications and 
were each selected for 22 patients with some overlap of 
the two groups. Thirty-two patients had UTG1A1 
status evaluated and dose reduction of irinotecan was 
done in 4 patients due to presence of UGT1A1*28/28 
genotype. Median dose intensities for the first cycle for 
each of the components were 100%. Average dose 
intensities for the first cycle for oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 
5-FU bolus, and 5-FU continuous infusion were 98%, 
90%, 59%, 99%, respectively. Overall dose averages 
for oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 5-FU bolus, and 5-FU 
continuous infusion were 96%, 88%, 57%, and 96%, 
respectively. From the 31 patients who started with full 
dose FOLFIRINOX, 20 (64.5%) required eventual 
dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy due to 
adverse events. 
G-CSF support was included for 41 patients (67.2%) 
starting with the first cycle using filgastrim. Except for 
three patients in whom G-CSF support was later 
discontinued, all others were continued on G-CSF for 
all subsequent cycles. On the other hand, from the 
twenty patients who were not started on G-CSF with 
first cycle, 6 (30.0%) had G-CSF support added later 
on. Overall 47 patients (77.0%) received G-CSF 
support at some point in their therapy. 

here were no deaths as a result of therapy. In six 
patients (9.8%) treatment was stopped after the first 
cycle due to adverse events. Rates of the most common 
grade 3-4 adverse events are listed in Table 2. 
Neutropenia was the most common grade 3-4 adverse 
event, occurring 
(19.7%), while 
in 12 patients 
neutropenic fever occurred in three patients (4.9%).

adverse events and follow-up time were summarized 
using means, medians, and standard deviations, ranges 
or counts and frequencies as appropriate. Progression- 
free survival was defined as time of FOLFIRINOX 
initiation 
time of progression based on 
time of death, 
imaging/clinical evaluation, or 
whichever occurred first. Those patients alive and 
progression-free were censored on March 1st, 2012, the 
date of data collection close. Overall survival was 
defined as time of FOLFIRINOX initiation to time of 
death. When not noted in clinical records, the Social 
Security Death index was used to ascertain survival 
and patients alive were censored in March 2012. The 
overall and progression-free survival were calculated 
using Kaplan-Meier product limit methods. Statistical 
analyses were performed using SAS (SAS Institutes, 
Cary, NC, USA). 
atient characteristics are shown in Table 1. A total of 
61 patients were enrolled and followed for a median of 
8.5 months (range of 1.5 to 20.4 months). Median age 
was 58 with a range of 37 to 72 years. Majority of the 
patients were male (54.1%), white (91.8%) and with 
ECOG performance of 0 or 1 (86.9%). Thirty-eight 
treated for metastatic or 
(62.3%) patients were 
recurrent disease, while 19 (31.1%) had 
locally 
advanced cancer and 4 had border-line resectable 
disease (6.6%). Twenty-five patients (41.0%) had 
tumor present in the pancreatic head at time of 
receiving FOLFIRINOX with 17 patients (27.9%) 
having a biliary stent. 




 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 23 patients died (37.7%) and 29 patients 
progressed (47.5%). Median progression-free survival 
was 7.5 months, with 1-year progression-free survival 
of 35.3%. Overall survival was recorded using medical 
records and Social Security Death index for all 
patients. Median overall survival was 13.5 months, 
with 1-year overall survival of 55.6% (Figure 1). One- 
year overall survival for patients with metastatic 
disease was 41.8% compared with 75.5% without 
metastasis. 
his is the first study to our knowledge examining 
FOLFIRINOX use outside of a clinical trial after the 
ACCORD study in U.S. patients with pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma [10]. FOLFIRINOX was found to be 
widely adopted at the centers examined in this study, 
not only in patients with metastatic disease who were 
the patient population studied in the ACCORD trial, 
but also in locally advanced and borderline-resectable 
disease. 
Given concerns for toxicities, FOLFIRINOX dosage 
was frequently adjusted empirically as well as in 
response to adverse events. In fact half of the patients 
were given reduced dosing of FOLFIRINOX starting 
with the first cycle before the development of any 
adverse events. Nonetheless, a significant portion of 
the patients (34.4%) were hospitalized due to adverse 
events. The rate of hospitalizations was not reported in 
the ACCORD trial. Only one case of cholangitis was 
seen, which is reassuring given the high propensity of 
stents in this patient population. A higher proportion of 
patients received G-CSF compared to the ACCORD 
trial (77.0% vs. 42.5%). Accordingly, rates of grade 3-4 
neutropenia were lower in our patient population 
(19.7% vs. 45.7%) but rates of neutropenic fever were 
similar in both studies at less than 5%. 
In spite of dose reductions, FOLFIRINOX was found 
to be very effective. Rates of response were similar to 


Table 3. Reason for discontinuation of therapy reported by 61 
patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with FOLFIRINOX. 











Two of 
these patients were already on G-CSF 
prophylaxis but were on full dose FOLFIRINOX 
therapy. Grade 3 or worse thrombocytopenia occurred 
in two patients (3.3%) while no patient had a grade 3-4 
anemia. Abdominal pain, fatigue and diarrhea were the 
severe non-hematological adverse events that were 
anti-diarrhea 
observed. 
medications as outpatient usually sufficed for treatment 
but hospitalizations were required for a total of 21 
patients (34.4%). There was one case of cholangitis 
whose tumor was in the pancreatic head and did not 
have a stent. No definite correlation was observed 
between adverse events and UGT1A1 genotype. 
Adverse events caused dose reduction in 23 patients 
(37.7%) and resulted in the eventual reason for 
discontinuation of FOLFIRINOX 
in 23 patients 
(37.7%). Overall eleven patients (18.0%) received full 
dose FOFIRINOX throughout their treatment without 
adverse events necessitating dose 
reduction or 
cessation. Reason for eventual discontinuation of 
FOLFIRINOX therapy is depicted in Table 3. 

orty patients (65.6%) had imaging available after at 
least three cycles of FOLFIRINOX therapy: 22 with 
metastatic disease (57.9%) and 18 with non-metastatic 
disease (78.3%). Overall, one patient had complete 
response (2.5%), nine patients had a partial response 
(22.5%), 19 had stable disease (47.5%), and 11 had 
disease progression (27.5%) (Table 4). All four patients 
receiving 
with 
resectable 
FOLFIRINOX were able 
resection 
afterwards. From the 19 patients with locally advanced 
disease, 4 (21.1%) were also able to undergo resection 
after receiving radiation following FOLFIRINOX 
therapy. From the 18 patients with non-metastatic 
disease who had imaging available, 9 (50.0%) had 
stable disease, 5 (27.8%) partial response and 1 (5.6%) 
had a complete 
treatment with 
FOLFIRINOX. From the 22 patients with metastatic 
disease, 14 (63.5%) had either partial response or 
stable disease.

Use of UTG1A1 testing and appropriate irinotecan 
dose reduction may be useful in reducing at least some 
of the toxicities. At the present time, however, 
FOLFIRINOX by itself is more effective than any 
other regimen in patients with pancreatic cancer and its 
toxicities did not preclude its use in the patients studied 
in this review.

the ACCORD study with more than 70% of patients 
having at least stable disease on therapy. Similar 
response rates were seen in non-metastatic patients 
who were not included in the ACCORD trial. In fact, 8 
patients were able 
resection after 
FOLFIRINOX therapy. This is notable given the 
extensive desmoplastic stroma reaction in localized 
disease and concern 
reduced efficacy of 
for 
chemotherapy in this setting. Progression-free and 
overall survivals were longer than the results published 
in the ACCORD trial (7.5 months and 13.5 months, 
respectively) likely reflecting inclusion of patients with 
non-metastatic disease. One-year survival rate for 
patients with metastatic disease was 41.8%, similar to 
the 48.4% reported in the ACCORD trial. 
The strength of this study is that it provides real world 
data on the use of FOLFIRINOX in patients with 
pancreatic cancer. Moreover, it provides the first data 
on patients treated in the U.S.. In addition, it includes 
patients with non-metastatic disease that were not 
included in the original ACCORD trial. The use of 
FOLFIRINOX in these patients has been reported in at 
least one other retrospective study and is promising 
[11]. One weakness of this study is that dose reductions 
were not protocol driven and instead were up to the 
discretion of the treating oncologists. As a result, it is 
difficult to judge if all treatment modifications were 
performed in a standard fashion or were clinically 
necessary. Similarly, not all physicians obtained tumor 
markers at regular intervals and therefore our study did 
not attempt to correlate tumor marker levels with 
response. Another weakness of this study is that the 
median age of patients at 58, while similar to the 
ACCORD study, was much younger than median age 
of 71 observed in the SEER database [12]. It is 
therefore important to note that it is not known whether 
older patients would tolerate this regimen. In regards to 
the use of G-CSF, rates of febrile neutropenia seen in 
this study do not justify use of growth factors per 
NCCN guidelines. However, given that 77.0% of 
patients received growth factor support, it could be 
argued that the rates of febrile neutropenia were low 
only as a result. It may therefore be reasonable to 
include G-CSF support with this regimen and later 
discontinue it if not needed. 
In conclusion, we believe it is acceptable to use 
FOLFIRINOX instead of gemcitabine monotherapy in 
future clinical trials as the new gold standard in 
patients with pancreatic cancer given its efficacy and 
acceptable rate of adverse events. It remains to be seen 
how FOLFIRINOX compares 
to other regimens 
currently in clinical trials, such as combination of 
gemcitabine with nab-paclitaxel, which has had 
promising results in phase I/II trials [13]. It is also not 
known whether FOLFIRINOX can serve as a backbone 
chemotherapy to which targeted agents, such as 
erlotinib, could be added similarly to what had been 
toxicity may 
done with gemcitabine. 
preclude addition of other agents to FOLFIRINOX.
