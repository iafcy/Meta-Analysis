Abstract 
The study aims were to determine the efﬁcacy and toxicity of FOLFIRINOX (5-ﬂuorouracil, irinotecan, and 
oxaliplatin) in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated at the Royal Marsden. Data from 
49 patients treated with FOLFIRINOX between 2010 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Efﬁcacy and 
tolerability were similar to that reported in clinical trials. 
Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has a very poor prognosis. Treatment with FOLFIRINOX has 
been shown to improve outcomes, but can be associated with signiﬁcant toxicity. Materials and Methods: 
A retrospective review was performed of all patients with locally advanced or metastatic PDA treated with FOLFIR- 
INOX at the Royal Marsden between November 2010 and November 2013. Efﬁcacy, tolerability, and potential prog- 
nostic factors were evaluated. Results: Twenty-seven patients with metastatic PDA and 22 patients with locally 
advanced PDA were treated with FOLFIRINOX. Patients received a median of 9 cycles (range, 1-26) of FOLFIRINOX. 
The overall response rate was 41% (20 patients), and a further 17 patients (35%) had stable disease. Thirty-ﬁve 
patients (71%) received FOLFIRINOX in the ﬁrst-line setting, with a median progression-free survival and overall 
survival, respectively, of 12.9 months and 18.4 months for patients with locally advanced disease; and 8.4 months and 
12.2 months for patients with metastatic disease. The most frequently occurring Grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia 
(29%), fatigue (18%), febrile neutropenia (14%), thromboembolism (12%), and thrombocytopenia (10%). In a univariate 
analysis, reduction in CA 19-9 of >50% (P < .001), normalization of CA19-9 (P < .001), surgery after FOLFIRINOX 
(P ¼ .004), and use of prophylactic pegﬁlgrastim (P ¼ .005) were prognostic for overall survival. Conclusion: The 
efﬁcacy and tolerability of FOLFIRINOX for PDA at our institution is similar to that reported in clinical trials. Careful 
selection of patients and monitoring of response (according to CA19-9) and toxicities can help maximize advantage in 
this patient population.

Pancreatic cancer has a very poor prognosis, with a 5-year sur- 
vival of approximately 6%, and only 10% to 20% of patients 
present with resectable disease.1 Gemcitabine became the standard 
of care after a small randomised trial, which demonstrated an 
improvement in median overall survival (OS) compared with bolus

5-ﬂuorouracil (5.6 vs. 4.4 months; P ¼ .002).2 Gemcitabine has 
been evaluated in combination with a variety of cytotoxic and 
targeted agents. For example, the addition of erlotinib was associ- 
ated with a median improvement in OS of 2 weeks,3 and a meta- 
analysis demonstrated a survival beneﬁt from the addition of 
capecitabine.4 
Over the past few years, additional treatment options have 
become available for patients with pancreatic cancer. In 2011, 
Conroy et al published the results of the landmark phase II/III 
Partenariat de Recherche en Oncologie Digestive (PRODIGE) 4/ 
Actions Concertées dans les Cancers Colo-Rectaux et Digestifs 
(ACCORD) 11 trial, which randomized 342 patients to ﬁrst-line 
treatment with either gemcitabine or a regimen comprised of 
5-ﬂuorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX).5 This

trial demonstrated that FOLFIRINOX was associated with 
signiﬁcant improvements in response rate (RR) and progression- 
free survival (PFS) and a clinically meaningful improvement in 
OS from 6.8 to 11.1 months (P < .001). However, although 
patients’ quality of life improved compared with treatment with 
gemcitabine, FOLFIRINOX was also associated with signiﬁcant 
and peripheral 
toxicities, 
neuropathy. The trial enrolled relatively younger patients with 
good performance status and therefore there were concerns as to 
whether the results could be applied to the general patient 
population outside of the context of clinical trials. More recently, 
the MPACT (Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical 
trial has also shown a signiﬁcant OS beneﬁt 
Trial) 
for the 
combination of nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine (8.5 months vs. 
6.7 months; P < .001)6 and this is now another treatment option 
for many patients. The toxicity proﬁle of gemcitabine/nab- 
paclitaxel 
is different to that of FOLFIRINOX and there is 
ongoing debate on how to select the optimal treatment strategy for 
an individual patient. 
At the Royal Marsden (RM), we have been treating patients 
with pancreatic cancer with FOLFIRINOX since 2010. We con- 
ducted a retrospective review of our experience with FOLFIRINOX 
in patients with locally advanced (LAPC) and metastatic (MPC) 
pancreatic cancer. The study objectives were to assess the efﬁcacy 
and safety of FOLFIRINOX outside of a clinical trial, to assess 
potential prognostic variables, and to evaluate whether 
initial 
treatment with FOLFIRINOX affects response to subsequent lines 
of chemotherapy. 

After approval from the institutional review board, we searched 
the pharmacy section of patients’ electronic medical 
records 
to identify patients treated with FOLFIRINOX at RM between 
November 2010 and November 2013. Patients were considered 
eligible if they received at least 1 cycle of FOLFIRINOX and had 
histological conﬁrmation of locally advanced or metastatic pancre- 
atic adenocarcinoma. 
Standard practice was to start treatment for patients using full-dose 
FOLFIRINOX, which consisted of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 over 2 
hours followed by irinotecan 180 mg/m2 and leucovorin 400 mg/m2 
given concurrently over 1 hour. This was immediately followed by 5- 
ﬂuorouracil given as a 400 mg/m2 bolus and then a continuous 
infusion of 2400 mg/m2 over 48 hours. The premedication regimen 
consisted of intravenous ondansetron and dexamethasone and pro- 
phylactic treatment with atropine was given to prevent cholinergic 
syndrome. Patients received oral dexamethasone and metoclopramide 
for 3 days and ciproﬂoxacin 250 mg twice daily for 7 days after 
chemotherapy. All patients were provided with loperamide and 
advised to start this at the ﬁrst sign of diarrhea. The use of prophylactic 
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and dose reductions 
was at the discretion of the treating physician. Treatment cycles were 
repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, or completion of the planned treatment course. 
Clinical information including patient demographic and clinical 
characteristics, CA19-9, safety/tolerability (measured according to 
Institute 
gradable toxicities according to the National Cancer 
Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0), hospital admissions, treat- 
ment regimes, and patient outcomes were retrospectively collected 
from patient records. Radiographic response was assessed by S.Y.M. 
and K.K. according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) 1.1 and compared with the ofﬁcial radiology reports. 
Most of the analysis is descriptive, with frequencies and medians 
being reported. PFS was calculated from the start of treatment 
with FOLFIRINOX to the date of progression or death. OS was 
calculated from the start of treatment with FOLFIRINOX to the 
date of death. Patients who were still alive were censored at the time 
of last follow-up. Association of survival outcomes with baseline 
prognostic factors was determined using Cox regression univariate 
analysis and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% conﬁdence intervals 
(CIs) were presented. Factors included in the univariate analysis 
were sex, age ((cid:2) 60 vs. > 60 years), T-stage, N-stage, extent of 
disease (LAPC vs. MPC), performance status, line of treatment, 
number of cycles (< 6 vs. (cid:3) 6), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, 
baseline CA19-9, normalization of CA19-9 (CA19-9 (cid:2) 37 vs. > 37 
U/mL), percentage decrease in CA19-9 ((cid:2) 50% vs. > 50% and (cid:2) 
90% vs. > 90%), surgery after FOLFIRINOX treatment, and use 
of prophylactic G-CSF. A multivariate Cox regression model for OS 
and PFS was developed using a forward stepwise selection method, 
which included all signiﬁcant univariate variables (P < .05). 
Results 
Patient Characteristics 
Between November 2010 and November 2013, 49 patients with 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma were treated with FOLFIRINOX at RM. 
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in 
Table 1. The median age was 60 (range, 34 -76) years and 26 (53%) 
of the patients were male. Twenty-two patients had LAPC (9 patients 
had borderline resectable disease and 13 had unresectable disease) 
and 27 had MPC at the time of treatment with FOLFIRINOX. 

Patients received a median of 9 cycles of FOLFIRINOX (range, 
1-26), with 12 patients receiving < 4 cycles and 22 patients 
receiving (cid:3) 12 cycles. The reasons for treatment discontinuation 
are shown in Table 2. The dose of 1 or more components of 
FOLFIRINOX was reduced in patients (74%), including omission 
of bolus 5-ﬂuorouracil in 7 patients (14%). The median number of 
cycles of oxaliplatin was 9 (range, 1-24). Dose delays of (cid:3) 7 days 
occurred in 23 patients (47%); with 16 patients (33%) having 
1 dose delay, 5 patients (10%) having 2 doses delayed, and 2 pa- 
tients (4%) having 3 doses delayed. Most dose delays were for 
7 days (87%) with 13% of dose delays lasting (cid:3) 14 days. 
Treatment-related toxicities are summarized in Table 3. There 
were no deaths related to chemotherapy toxicities. Fourteen pa- 
tients (29%) had biliary stents in situ at the time of treatment 
with FOLFIRINOX (7 metal, 2 plastic, 5 stent type unknown), 
and there was 1 case of cholangitis. Nineteen patients (39%) had 
1 emergency hospital admission during treatment with FOLFIR- 
INOX, with a median duration of 4.5 days (range, 4-5 days) and 
2 patients (4%) were admitted twice (median duration of second 
admission, 11.5 days; range, 2-21 days). 
G-CSF (pegﬁlgrastim or ﬁlgrastim) was given as primary pro- 
phylaxis from cycle 1 onwards in 29 patients (59%), and these

with an overall RR (ORR) of 41%. A further 17 patients (35%) had 
stable disease. In addition to the 1 patient who had a complete 
response on computed tomography imaging, 4 patients had a 
complete metabolic response on positron emission tomography 
imaging. Twenty-ﬁve patients (51%) had a reduction in CA 19-9 
of > 50% and 15 patients (31%) had a reduction of > 90%. After 
a median follow-up of 20.6 months, the median PFS and OS for 
the whole cohort was 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.4-11.5) and 12.9 
months (95% CI, 9.3-16.6), respectively. Patients with LAPC had a 
median PFS and OS of 12.0 and 18.4 months, respectively, and 
patients with MPC had a median PFS of 6.9 months and an OS 
of 10.4 months. Thirty-ﬁve patients (71%) received FOLFIRINOX 
in the ﬁrst-line setting, with a median PFS and OS of 12.9 months 
(95% CI, 0.5-25.4) and 18.4 months (95% CI, 8.2-28.6) for pa- 
tients with LAPC and 8.4 months (95% CI, 4.6-12.1) and 
12.2 (95% CI, 6.6-17.7) months for patients with MPC (Figures 1 
and 2). FOLFIRINOX was given as a second-line treatment in 
13 patients (27%) and as a third-line treatment in 1 patient. The 
median PFS and OS for these 14 patients were 3.9 months and 
8.2 months, respectively. 
Two patients survived for more than 36 months. One patient 
with locally advanced, unresectable disease at presentation had a 
complete pathological response after 12 cycles of ﬁrst-line FOL- 
FIRINOX, consolidation chemoradiotherapy, and surgery. The 
second patient had metastatic disease at presentation and had pro- 
gressive disease after 5 cycles of GEMCAP (gemcitabine and cape- 
citabine). The patient received 14 cycles of FOLFIRINOX in

patients received a higher median number of cycles of FOLFIR- 
INOX (12 vs. 6.5 cycles, P ¼ .083). Although patients who 
received prophylactic G-CSF from cycle 1 and onward had reduced 
Grade (cid:3) 3 neutropenia (24% vs. 35%; P ¼ .524) and febrile 
neutropenia (10% vs. 20%; P ¼ .422), this was not statistically 
signiﬁcant. Of the 20 patients who did not start prophylactic G- 
CSF from cycle 1, 3 patients (6%) subsequently received G-CSF 
because of febrile neutropenia and 3 patients (6%) received G-CSF 
for neutropenia. 

In the whole cohort (LAPC and MPC), 1 patient had a complete 
response and a further 19 patients (39%) had a partial response,

After completing treatment with FOLFIRINOX, 15 patients 
these 
received consolidation radiotherapy. Thirteen of 
(31%) 
patients received 54 Gy in 30 fractions with concomitant capeci- 
tabine, 1 patient discontinued chemoradiotherapy after 18 fractions 
because of the development of acute renal failure, and 1 patient 
received CyberKnife (38 Gy in 3 fractions) to the pancreatic 
surgical bed. 
Seven patients with LAPC underwent surgery (Table 5), with a 
PFS of 29.9 months (95% CI, 1.3-58.7). One patient died 
from liver failure after surgery, which was thought to be due to 
an ischemic hepatic insult in the perioperative period on a back- 
ground of steatohepatitis secondary to diabetes and prolonged 
chemotherapy exposure. In addition, 2 patients with resectable 
liver metastases underwent surgery, achieving R0 resections. These 
2 patients were alive and disease-free at 28 months and 8 months, 
respectively, after resection. 
At the time of the last follow-up, 25 patients (51%) had received 
1 or more further lines of palliative chemotherapy. Of these 25 
patients, 15 patients (60%) received GEMCAP. Other treatment 
regimens used were FOLFIRINOX rechallenge (4 patients), 
nab-paclitaxel (2 patients), gemcitabine (2 patients), gemcitabine/ 
nab-paclitaxel (1 patient), and gemcitabine/erlotinib (1 patient). 
The ORR to the line of treatment after FOLFIRINOX was 8% 
(2 patients), with a further 13 patients (52%) having stable disease. 
At the time of analysis, 5 patients were undergoing their ﬁrst line of 
chemotherapy after FOLFIRINOX and 9 patients had received or 
were currently undergoing their second line of chemotherapy after 
FOLFIRINOX. 


The purpose of this study was to evaluate our experience of 
FOLFIRINOX in patients treated at RM outside of the context of a 
clinical 
treatment was comparable with 
that seen in the PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 trial. For patients 
with MPC, the RR of 41% was greater than the 32% reported 
by Conroy et al,5 but was comparable with the 47% reported by 
another retrospective series.7 Survival outcomes were also broadly 
similar, with a PFS of 8.4 months and an OS of 12.2 months in 
patients with MPC treated in the ﬁrst-line setting (compared with 
6.4 months and 11.1 months in the PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 
study) and this supports the theory that these outcomes can be 
achieved outside of a clinical trial setting. As expected, the outcomes 
for patients with LAPC were better than those for patients with 
MPC, with a PFS of 12.9 months and an OS of 18.4 months. 
Again, this was comparable with previously published retrospective 
series (PFS, 11.7-16.1 months; OS, 17.8 months-not reached).7-9 
Even though analysis of the quality of life data from the PRO- 
DIGE 4/ACCORD 11 trial demonstrated that FOLFIRINOX 
improved patients’ quality of life compared with gemcitabine,10 one 
of the main concerns with FOLFIRINOX is the potential level of 
toxicity associated with this treatment regimen. The toxicities 
experienced by our patients were broadly similar to those in pre- 
vious reports, although the incidence of Grade 3/4 diarrhea (4%) 
was 
(2.9%- 
30%).5,7,8,11-16 This might be because of dose reductions and 
prompt supportive care with loperamide. Despite some patients 






























the second-line setting, with a partial response. After a treatment 
break, 
rechallenged with a further 6 cycles 
of FOLFIRINOX, with a complete response. This patient subse- 
quently developed disease progression, and did not respond to a 
second rechallenge with FOLFIRINOX, but achieved stable disease 
after a rechallenge with GEMCAP. 

A univariate analysis (Table 4), demonstrated that extent of 
disease, number of cycles, use of prophylactic G-CSF from cycle 1, 
surgery after FOLFIRINOX, line of treatment, percentage reduc- 
tion in CA 19-9 of > 50% and a CA 19-9 nadir < the upper limit 
of normal (37 U/mL) were prognostic for PFS and OS. After a 
multivariate analysis, percentage reduction in CA 19-9 (P < .001; 
HR, 6.3; 95% CI, 2.8-14.0), 
surgery after FOLFIRINOX 
(P ¼ .013; HR, 12.9; 95% CI, 1.7-96.8), and extent of disease 
(P ¼ .009; HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.5) were signiﬁcant for PFS; 
and percentage reduction in CA 19-9 (P ¼ .003; HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 
1.5-7.6) and surgery after FOLFIRINOX (P ¼ .044; HR, 7.9; 
95% CI, 1.1-59.8) were also signiﬁcant for OS.

continuing FOLFIRINOX for (cid:3) 12 cycles, the rate of Grade (cid:3) 3 
peripheral neuropathy was comparable with previously published 
series, although oxaliplatin was frequently discontinued after 9 cy- 
cles. Although a large proportion of patients (43%) required 1 or 
more emergency hospital admissions during treatment with FOL- 
FIRINOX, this was broadly comparable with that seen in other 
retrospective series (32%-36%),9,13,14 and most patients were dis- 
charged within 5 days. 
In previously published studies, the rate of Grade 3/4 neu- 
tropenia varied from 3% to 57%,5,7-9,11-17 probably at least partly 
because of intra- and interstudy variations in G-CSF use. Interest- 
ingly, 
in our study, a univariate analysis showed that patients 
who received G-CSF had a longer PFS and OS. One potential 
explanation for this is that G-CSF support might have facilitated 
longer treatment with FOLFIRINOX and therefore greater treat- 
ment efﬁcacy. However, these data should be interpreted with 
caution because there are a number of potential confounding vari- 
ables and these results were not conﬁrmed in multivariate analysis 
(although this analysis was in turn limited because of the small 
number of patients in our study). 
In our patients, dose delays were common, occurring in 47% 
of patients. This is in keeping with that reported by other series,16 and 
for logistical reasons were generally for 7 days. Similarly, dose re- 
ductions were also common, occurring in 74% of patients. Although 
this is more than the 29% to 58% reported in other series,12,14 this 
might reﬂect that most of our patients started treatment with full-

dose FOLFIRINOX. In contrast, other series commonly used a 
modiﬁed FOLFIRINOX regimen8 or started treatment for many 
patients with reduced-dose FOLFIRINOX,7,14 although the efﬁcacy 
results were comparable. Furthermore, the median number of treat- 
ment cycles was 9, with some patients receiving substantially longer 
courses of treatment (up to 26 cycles) and therefore oxaliplatin was 
frequently discontinued or reduced to reduce the risk of persistent 
peripheral neuropathy. Despite the toxicities experienced by our 
patients, a lower than expected proportion of patients stopped 
treatment because of toxicity and a high proportion of patients 
received 12 or more cycles of FOLFIRINOX. This suggests that 
the toxicities associated with FOLFIRINOX are manageable with 
supportive care and dose reductions, allowing treatment to be 
continued in a large proportion of carefully-selected patients. 

in combination with gemcitabine has recently 
been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and 
the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of advanced 
pancreatic cancer. There is ongoing debate regarding the optimal 
scheduling of treatment because patients whose disease progresses 
during ﬁrst-line therapy might not be ﬁt enough for further 

chemotherapy and no head-to-head comparison of FOLFIRINOX 
and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel has been performed to date. 
Some physicians advocate starting with FOLFIRINOX, because 
patients who undergo ﬁrst-line treatment tend to be more ﬁt and 
better able to tolerate treatment toxicities, and the patients treated 
with FOLFIRINOX in the PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 study 
had a greater RR and longer survival than those treated with 
gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in the MPACT study. In addition, for 
patients with locally advanced disease, FOLFIRINOX can lead to 
tumor downstaging and the option of surgical resection, leading to 
improved patient outcomes.8,12,18,19 In our study, 9 patients un- 
derwent surgery after treatment with FOLFIRINOX. Interestingly, 
this included 2 patients who had surgery for resectable liver me- 
tastases and this has resulted in a prolonged disease-free interval for 
both patients. Further research is needed to determine whether 
surgery should be an option for patients with small-volume meta- 
static disease, a good performance status, and an objective response 
to treatment. 
Second-line chemotherapy after FOLFIRINOX is feasible in 
selected patients, with 51% of our patients receiving further palli- 
ative chemotherapy. This is comparable with the 47% of patients in 
the FOLFIRINOX arm of the PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 study,5 
and greater than the 38% of patients in the gemcitabine/nab- 
paclitaxel arm of the MPACT study who received second-line 
therapy.6 In contrast to the PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 study, in 
which patients commonly received gemcitabine, most of our pa- 
tients received GEMCAP. Fifty-two percent of patients achieved 
stable disease with their next line of therapy and although the RR 
was only 8%, it should be borne in mind that even in the ﬁrst-line 
setting, the RR to GEMCAP is only 10% to 17%.4 There is limited 
published evidence for the use of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel after 
FOLFIRINOX treatment, apart from case reports that described 
2 patients who had good responses,20,21 but this could be an option 
if funding is available. 
Conversely, other physicians advocate starting with gemcitabine/ 
its more favorable toxicity proﬁle, 
nab-paclitaxel because of 
and because persistent peripheral neuropathy secondary to FOL- 
FIRINOX treatment can mean that nab-paclitaxel 
is not an 
appropriate second-line treatment option. In the United Kingdom, 
is only funded through the Cancer 
gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel 
Drugs Fund as a ﬁrst-line treatment, and therefore FOLFIRINOX 
would need to be given in the second-line setting for patients to 
receive both regimens. There are limited data available on the use of 
FOLFIRINOX as a second-line treatment, and this has typically 
been used after gemcitabine or GEMCAP chemotherapy rather 
than gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. In our study, 13 patients (27%) 
received FOLFIRINOX as a second-line treatment and 1 patient 
was treated with third-line FOLFIRINOX. The PFS and OS of 
these 14 patients were 3.9 months and 8.2 months, respectively. 
These results are comparable with the median time to progression/ 
PFS of 2.8 to 5.4 months and OS of 8.2 to 8.5 months reported 
by other second-line studies of FOLFIRINOX.11,17 
It is important to identify patients who are most likely to respond 
to FOLFIRINOX so that the optimal treatment regimen is chosen 
for each individual patient. In our series, a decrease in CA19-9 of 
> 50% was associated with improved PFS and OS. This is in 
keeping with other published reports, which suggest that although

CA19-9 levels were not associated with response according to 
RECIST,8 CA19-9 responders had a signiﬁcantly longer OS8,17 and 
a CA19-9 response has also been demonstrated to correlate with 
improved survival in patients treated with gemcitabine/nab-pacli- 
taxel.6 Patients who met the PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 trial in- 
clusion criteria seemed to have better outcomes than those who did 
not,22 and this emphasizes the need for careful selection of patients 
for treatment with FOLFIRINOX. Indeed, the patients in our 
study who had a performance status of 2 appear to have had a worse 
PFS and OS, although because of the small number of patients it 
was not possible to analyze whether this was statistically signiﬁcant. 

Although our results should be interpreted with caution because 
of the retrospective nature of our study, our institutional experience 
shows that outcomes broadly comparable with that seen in the 
PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 trial can be achieved in a non-trial 
setting in the United Kingdom. Toxicities are signiﬁcant, but 
manageable, with only a small proportion of patients stopping 
treatment because of toxicity. Although FOLFIRINOX can be 
safely administered as a second-line treatment in selected patients, 
the optimal scheduling of FOLFIRINOX with other treatment 
options such as gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel is as yet undetermined. 
This requires future study, but in the meantime, the choice of 
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient and their 
available treatment options. 
Clinical Practice Points 
(cid:4) Advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma has a poor prognosis. The 
combination of 5-ﬂuorouracil, 
irinotecan and oxaliplatin 
(FOLFIRINOX) has been shown to improve outcomes, but can 
be associated with signiﬁcant toxicity. 

the efﬁcacy and tolerability of 
FOLFIRINOX for pancreatic adenocarcinoma were similar to 
that reported in clinical trials. 
(cid:4) With careful patient selection, the toxicities associated with 
FOLFIRINOX were manageable in routine clinical practice. 
(cid:4) Treatment with FOLFIRINOX facilitated subsequent surgical 
resection in a proportion of patients whose disease was consid- 
ered unsuitable for upfront surgery. Patients who underwent 
surgery after FOLFIRINOX had a longer progression-free and 
overall survival. 
(cid:4) This study provides more information on the use of FOLFIR- 
INOX in the second-line setting and this may be a treatment 
option for carefully selected patients.
