**Abstract. FOLFIRINOX is a highly active regimen for the**
treatment of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.
However, treatment with FOLFIRINOX is associated with
relevant toxicity and predictors for response to therapy are
warranted. We retrospectively analyzed 49 patients with
unresectable pancreatic cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX in
order to evaluate a possible predictive role of clinical param­
eters and tumor characteristics for response to chemotherapy.
Tumor samples were characterized histopathologically before
treatment and expression of p53 and Ki67 was analyzed using
automated immunohistochemistry. Overall survival (OS) and
progression-free survivall (PFS) were estimated by the KaplanMeier method. The overall objective response rate was 55.1%, the
disease control rate was 70.6%. Female gender was associated
with a significantly higher disease control rate of 91.7 compared
to 48.0% in male patients (p=0.001) which reached 100% in

female patients when primarily treated compared to treatment
after surgical resection and relapse (77.8%, p=0.057). For all
patients median PFS was 3.5 months (95% CI, 2.7-4.3 months)
and median OS was 13 months (95% CI, 9.4-16.6 months).
Female patients showed a tendency towards a longer median
PFS (5.0 months, 95% CI, 3.6-6.4 months) compared to males
(3.0 months, 95% CI, 2.4-3.6 months) (p=0.099). Serum
levels of CA19.9 and CEA were significantly higher in female
patients compared to male patients (p=0.037, p=0.05). Tumors
of patients with response to FOLFIRINOX showed a higher
expression level of p53 and Ki67 as well as higher serum levels
of CA19.9 compared to non-responders, which was statistically
not significant. Our study indicates that female gender is a posi­
tive predictor for therapy response to FOLFIRINOX in patients
with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Female gender in turn was
associated with increased levels of tumor markers CEA and
CA19.9 and patients with higher serum levels of CA19.9 were
more responsive to FOLFIRINOX.

**Introduction**

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related
death in men and women (1). Up to 85% of patients are diag­
nosed at an advanced stage when the tumor is unresectable
because of infiltration of local arteries or distant metastasis
(2). Gemcitabine has been the standard of care for the treat­
ment of advanced pancreatic cancer based on a randomized
trial showing an improvement in the one-year survival with
gemcitabine compared to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (3). Although
well‑tolerated, the efficacy of gemcitabine is modest, with
reported response rates (RR) of 10% and median survival of
less than 7 months (3). The combination of gemcitabine with
a variety of cytotoxic and targeted agents has generally shown
no significant survival advantage as compared to gemcitabine
alone (4). Some studies have suggested a significant benefit
in overall survival (OS) and progression‑free survival (PFS)

associated with gemcitabine-based cytotoxic combinations in
patients with good performance status (5,6). An impressive effi­
cacy and longer median OS of 10.2 months was first reported
in a phase II study in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer
under treatment with the combination regimen FOLFIRINOX
(oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 5-FU and leucovorin) (7). Subsequently,
FOLFIRINOX was compared to gemcitabine in a randomized
phase III trial in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (8).
This study confirmed statistically significant and clinically rele­
vant improvements in OS (11.1 vs. 6.8 months), PFS (6.4 vs. 3.3
months) and RR (31.6 vs. 9.4%) with FOLFIRINOX compared
to gemcitabine alone. Because of significant higher grade 3 and
4 toxicities (mostly neutropenia, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia, sensory neuropathy) with FOLFIRINOX
and the limited survival time of patients with advanced pancre­
atic cancer, biomarkers allowing a better patient selection are
required. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess clinical
(age, body mass index, gender), histopathological [histology,
grading, tumor location, T-stage, levels of carboanhydrase 19.9
(CA19.9) and carcinoembryogenic antigen (CEA), p53 and
Ki67 expression] parameters of patients with advanced pancre­
atic cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX and their association
with response to treatment.

**Materials and methods**

_Study design and assessment of response. We conducted a_
retrospective review of all patients with either primarily locally
advanced, metastatic or recurrent unresectable pancreatic
cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX at our department between
October, 2010 and November, 2012. We evaluated patient and
tumor characteristics such as gender, age, age adapted body
mass index (BMI), performance status, T-stage according to
the TNM classification, initial tumor localization (the head
vs. the body, tail or the papilla of the pancreas) and primary
metastases (hepatic, peritoneal, pulmonal) or localization of
relapse (local vs. visceral metastasis) based on review of the
patients' medical records. Response was assessed by review of
the patients imaging studies according to RECIST criteria as
complete (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or
progressive disease (PD) as well as by tumor marker response
of CA19.9 (9). Thus, a decrease or increase in CA19.9 by 50%
compared to baseline after treatment was classified as PR
or PD, respectively. The objective response rate was defined
as the percentage of patients with CR and PR. The disease
control rate was defined as the percentage of patients with
CR, PR and SD (Table I).

_Treatment. Full dose FOLFIRINOX consisted of oxaliplatin_
85 mg/m[2] over 3 h, followed by irinotecan 180 mg/m[2] over
90 min and leucovorin 400 mg/m[2] over 2 h, followed by 5-FU
400 mg/m[2] as a bolus and 2,400 mg/m[2] as a 46 h continuous
infusion. Dose modifications due to toxicity were made
according to the discretion of the treating physician. Treatment
was discontinued in case of unacceptable toxicity, progression
of disease or pursuit of alternative therapies including surgical
resection or radiotherapy for locally advanced disease (Fig. 1).

_Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical staining for_
Ki67 and p53 protein was performed using the antibodies


monoclonal mouse anti-human Ki67 (clone MIB-1, Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark) at a working dilution of 1:500 and
monoclonal mouse anti-human p53 (clone DO-7, Dako) at a
working dilution of 1:200 on routinely formalin-fixed paraffin
embedded (FFPE) tissue, using a standardized automated plat­
form (AutostainerPlus, Dako) in combination with Envision
polymer detection system (Dako). Archival FFPE sections
(3 µm) were deparaffinized in combination with heat‑induced
epitope retrieval (HIER) at 98˚C for 40 min in antigen
retrieval buffer pH 9.0 (Dako) in a PT Link™-module (Dako).
Endogenous peroxidase blocking was carried out for 10 min
with 3% H2O2 in absolute methanol and normal serum was
applied. Primary antibodies and detection reagents were incu­
bated at RT for 30 min and after several washes detection was
performed using EnvisionFlex™ detection system, followed by
chromogenic visualisation with diaminobenzidine (DAB) for
10 min. Nuclear counterstaining was performed with hema­
toxylin. Assessment of Ki67 and p53 staining was performed
according to the recommendations of the International Ki67 in
Breast Cancer working group (10). At least three high-power
(x40 objective) fields and clear hot spots were selected to
represent the spectrum of staining seen and 100 cancer cells
were evaluated.

_CA19.9 and CEA measurement. CA19.9 and CEA measure­_
ments were carried out at a certified laboratory associated with
the hospital by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The upper limit
normally used for CA19.9 was 37 U/ml and for CEA 3.5 µg/l.
Serum levels of CA19.9 and CEA were measured before
therapy and every second week during therapy.

_Statistics. Baseline and clinicopathological characteristics were_
summarized as median and range for continuous variables and
as absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables.
Comparisons in regard to gender and therapy response were
either performed with the Kruskal-Wallis, the Mann-Whitney
U or the χ[2] test. P-values <0.05 were considered to indicate
statistical significance. Tumor markers were correlated with
each other using Spearman rank correlation coefficient. A
multivariate logistic regression model was performed to assess
the joint effect of gender, age and clinical variables such as
tumor stage, line of treatment (primary treatment vs. treatment
in the relapsed stage) and biomarkers such as Ki67 and p53 on
the response rate. OS and PFS were estimated using the KaplanMeier method together with the log-rank test. As survival
measures, median and 95% confidence intervals are given.

**Results**

_Characteristics of the patients. Between October 2010 and_
November 2012 a total of 52 patients with either locally
advanced non-metastatic (n=6), metastatic (n=31) or relapsed
unresectable pancreatic cancer after initial resection (n=15)
were treated with FOLFIRINOX at our department (Fig. 1).
Two patients discontinued CTX after the first application due
to grade 3 toxicities (1 febrile neutropenia, 1 diarrhea) or cancer
related complications (1 patient with ileus) and therefore were
excluded from our analysis. Thus, a total of 49 patients could
finally be included in our study Demographic and tumor

parameters were equally distributed between both genders
(Table ΙΙ). Although female patients showed higher numbers
of metastatic tumors (15 vs. 13) and no locally advanced
non‑metastatic tumors before treatment compared to males
(0 vs. 6 months) (p=0.095), they were characterized by signifi­
cant higher levels of CA19.9 (p=0.037) and CEA (p=0.05).

_Efficacy of FOLFIRINOX in the whole study population and_
_according to gender._ Based on the imaging studies of the
patients as well as tumor marker response we confirmed a PR


and SD in 27 (55.1%) and 7 (14.3%) patients, respectively. There
were no complete remissions (CR). Fifteen out of 49 patients
(30.6%) patients did not respond to a CTX with FOLFIRINOX
and were classified as PD (Table III). When response rates were
analyzed according to gender, a significantly higher objective
response rate, defined as patients with either CR or PR, of 75 vs.
36% (p=0.004) as well as a higher disease control rate defined
as patients with either PR or SD of 91.7 vs. 48% (p=0.001) was
seen in female patients compared to male patients (Table III).
The predictive effect of gender on the response rate remained
statistically significant (p=0.041) in the multivariate logistic
regression analysis adjusting for age, tumor stage, line of
treatment, Ki67 and p53. Two female patients with metastatic
disease as well as 2 male patients with locally advanced disease
were able to undergo resection (Fig. 1).

_Efficacy of FOLFIRINOX in primarily treated and relapsed_
_pancreatic carcinomas. Disease control rates in the whole_
study population did not differ significantly when RRs were
assessed in untreated patients compared to patients after
surgical resection and treatment in the relapsed stage (70.6 vs.
66.7%). However, when patients were analyzed according to
gender and line of treatment, in women FOLFIRINOX caused
a disease control rate of 100% in the first-line setting compared
to 77.8% in the relapsed stage (p=0.057). Male patients showed
a significantly lower disease control rate of 47.4% after firstline treatment than females (p=0.001). Their response rates
in first-line and treatment in the relapsed stage (50%) did not
differ (p=0.670) (Table IV).

_Progression-free and overall survival._ Survival data are
shown in Table V and Fig. 2. For the entire cohort of patients
the median PFS was 3.5 months (95% CI, 2.7-4.3 months) with
a median OS of 13 months (95% CI, 9.4-16.6 months). Despite
significantly higher response rates, female patients showed
only a tendency towards a longer median PFS of 5 months
compared to 3 months in male patients (p=0.09) (Fig. 2A).
The median OS did not significantly differ between female
(15 months, 95% CI, 6.5-23.5 months) and male patients (12
months, 95% CI, 9.7-14.3 months) (p=0.20) (Fig. 2B).

_Clinicopathological characteristics and their association_
_with response to treatment with FOLFIRINOX. There was_
no significant associations of either age, BMI, serum levels of
CA19.9 and CEA or expression of p53 and Ki67 in pancreatic
tumors with response to FOLFIRINOX (Table VI). However,
tumors of patients with PR to FOLFIRINOX showed a tendency
towards a higher expression of Ki67 and p53 as well as higher
levels of CA19.9 compared to resistant tumors. In univariate
analysis CA19.9 levels were significantly associated with the
expression of Ki67 (p=0.017, r=0.39) (data not shown).

**Discussion**

Most patients with pancreatic cancer are either unresect­
able at diagnosis or will suffer from a relapse after initial
surgery, resulting in a 5-year OS of 6% (11). The median OS
of patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer is
6 months with most chemotherapeutic options (4). Treatment
with FOLFIRINOX has offered a new option for patients with

in our highly selected study population all patients (100%)
exhibited an ECOG performance status (PS) 0 whereas the
majority (61%) of patients in the historical group of Conroy
_et al had an ECOG PS 1. Higher response rates of 45%_
compared to the historical data of Conroy et al were also
obtained in another retrospective analysis performed by
Gunturu et al (12). This study population also consisted of
a higher percentage of patients (69%) with an ECOG PS 0.

When RRs were assessed according to gender a highly
significant difference in response to FOLFIRINOX could
be seen between the female and male treatment groups. As
shown in Table III, there was a significant higher percentage
of female patients with PR (75%) compared to males (36%)
(p=0.004) leading to a significantly (p=0.001) higher
disease control rate in female patients (91.7 vs. 48.0%). To
our knowledge, this is the first study reporting different
response rates to CTX according to gender in patients with
pancreatic cancer. Although we could see a tendency towards
a longer median PFS in female patients (5 months) compared
to males (3 months) (p=0.099) significantly higher response
rates did not cause a significant difference in the median
OS between female and male patients (15 vs. 12 months)
(p=0.200) (Table V, Fig. 2). This might be explained by the
small sample size as well as the fact, that there was a higher
number of locally advanced non‑metastatic tumors in male
patients compared to females (6 vs. 0) (p=0.095) (Table II).
Patients with locally advanced pancreatic tumors are known
to have a longer median OS of 15.7 months than patients
with metastatic pancreatic tumors (9.5 months) (7). Thus,
the higher number of locally advanced pancreatic tumors
in male patients might have nullified the benefit of higher
response rates in female patients. Retrospective analyses
should be viewed with caution and causes for the improved
RR to FOLFIRINOX in the female study population remain
speculative. Demographic and baseline disease character­
istics were well‑balanced and did not differ significantly


between the female and male group in our study. CA19.9 is
the most extensively studied and validated biomarker for the
diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (13). Despite its limitations as
false negative results in sialyl Lewis negative individuals and
false positive elevation in the presence of obstructive jaun­
dice CA19.9 serum levels as well as a reduction in CA19.9
levels during treatment have prognostic and predictive value
(13). It has been reported that patients with pretreatment
levels lower than median showed a better tumor response to
neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy with 5-FU or adjuvant CTX
with gemcitabine (14,15). There are no data so far regarding
the predictive value of pretreatment levels of CA19.9 and
response to CTX with FOLFIRINOX. In our patients
serum levels of CA19.9 (p=0.037) and CEA (0.05) were
significantly higher in female patients compared to males
(Table II). There was a tendency of higher serum levels of
CA19.9 (median 1,612 vs. 1,322 U/ml) in tumors of objective
responders (PR) compared to patients with PD (Table V).
However, the difference did not reach significance probably
because of the limited sample size. While an association of
response to CTX and the rate of Ki67 in breast cancer as
well some gastrointestinal cancers has been reported, data in
pancreatic cancer for Ki67 as a potential predictive marker
for response CTX cancer are lacking (16-19). The prolif­
eration rate of tumor cells as defined by Ki67 was higher
in responders vs. non-responders (median 25.0 vs. 17.5%
positive cells) in our patients. In univariate analysis of our
cohort, CA19.9 serum levels were significantly associated
with the expression of Ki67 in univariate analysis (p=0.017,
r=0.39, data not shown).

Despite its central role in the control of apoptosis, senes­
cence and cell cycle arrest, the tumor suppressor protein p53
remains an enigma for its possible role in predicting response
to chemotherapy in cancer patients. Mutant p53 proteins
generally have an increased stability and accumulate in the
nucleus of tumor cells and may be detectable by immunohis­
tochemistry. It is believed that this is a consequence of the
inactive p53 mutant protein not inducing the MDM2 protein
required to target its own degradation (20). The status of p53 is
associated with cancer cell resistance to various chemothera­
peutics (21,22). Wild‑type p53 is thought to render tumors
more sensitive to treatment by the induction of apoptosis, and
p53 inactivation may lead to resistance to treatment. However,
because p53 is also responsible for prolonged cell cycle arrest
after chemotherapy-induced genetic damage, it is expected to
facilitate DNA repair in the absence of an apoptotic response.
Therefore tumors that inactivate p53 might be less capable of
DNA repair and more sensitive to a DNA damage-induced
mitotic catastrophe as reported in gastric cancer (23). In our
cohort of patients p53 staining was increased in responders
as compared to non-responders (20.0 vs. 5.5% positive cells,
Table VI), although this difference was not statistically signif­
icant. The role of p53 in predicting response to FOLFIRINOX
in pancreatic cancer patients will have to be studied in a larger
cohort of patients.

The results of our study indicate, that female gender could
positively predict response to FOLFIRINOX in patients with
advanced pancreatic cancer. The predictive value of serum
levels of CA19.9 and expression of p53 and Ki67 in advanced
pancreatic tumors require further substantiation
