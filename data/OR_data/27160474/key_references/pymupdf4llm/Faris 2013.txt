**ABSTRACT**


The objective of our retrospective institutional experience is to
report the overall response rate, R0 resection rate, progressionfree survival, and safety/toxicity of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX (5fluorouracil [5-FU], oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and leucovorin) and
chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced pancreatic
cancer (LAPC). Patients with LAPC treated with FOLFIRINOX
were identified via the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center pharmacy database. Demographic information,
clinicalcharacteristics,andsafety/tolerabilitydatawerecompiled. Formal radiographic review was performed to determineoverallresponserates(ORRs).Twenty-twopatientswith
LAPC began treatment with FOLFIRINOX between July 2010
and February 2012. The ORR was 27.3%, and the median pro

gression-free survival was 11.7 months. Five of 22 patients
were able to undergo R0 resections following neoadjuvant
FOLFIRINOX and chemoradiation. Three of the five patients
have experienced distant recurrence within 5 months. Thirtytwo percent of patients required at least one emergency department visit or hospitalization while being treated with
FOLFIRINOX. FOLFIRINOX possesses substantial activity in patients with LAPC. The use of FOLFIRINOX was associated with
conversion to resectability in �20% of patients. However, the
recurrences following R0 resection in three of five patients
and the toxicities observed with the use of this regimen raise
important questions about how to best treat patients with
LAPC. **_TheOncologist2013;18:543–548_**

**INTRODUCTION**

Pancreatic cancer is estimated to have affected over 43,000
patients and to have caused 37,000 deaths in the United
Statesin2012[1].Only10%–20%ofpatientspresentwithsurgically resectable disease, and for patients who undergo surgical resection, the 5-year overall survival rate is 15–20%.
Approximately 30% of patients presenting with a new diagnosis of pancreatic cancer lack evidence of systemic metastases
andpresentwithlocallyadvanceddisease[2,3],forwhichmedian overall survival is approximately 1 year.
The optimal treatment paradigm and the role for chemoradiationforpatientswithlocallyadvancedpancreaticcancerisun

clear, with no definitive guidance from studies to date on the
superiority of chemotherapy versus chemoradiation approaches.Withregardtogemcitabinealoneversusgemcitabinebased chemoradiation, two recent randomized controlled
studies reached different conclusions. The Federation Francophone de Cancerologie Digestive and Societe Francophone de
Radiotherapie Oncologique trial demonstrated improved
overall survival with gemcitabine alone compared with induction chemoradiation followed by gemcitabine chemoradiation employing 5-FU/cisplatin [4]. In contrast, the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group 4201 trial compared gemcit

abine alone with gemcitabine-based chemoradiation, with
improved overall survival with the chemoradiation arm (onesided p � .017), which was accompanied by substantial increases in grade 4/5 toxicities [5]. Both studies did not accrue
to planned patient enrollment, hampering the interpretation
of results. There have been no randomized trials to assess the
potential benefit of initial chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation, although retrospective data support this approach

[6,7].Inaddition,somepatientswithlocallyadvancedpancreatic cancer will be rendered resectable by virtue of having an
excellent response to therapy [8–10].
The landscape for systemic therapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer has changed significantly with the use of
FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil [5-FU], oxaliplatin, irinotecan,
and leucovorin). In a randomized phase III study comparing
FOLFIRINOXwithgemcitabinein342chemotherapy-naivepatients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, FOLFIRINOX was associated with an improved survival, progression-free survival,
and response rate. [11]. Based on the data supporting the use
ofFOLFIRINOXinthemetastaticsetting,thereisgreatinterest
inassessingtheactivityofFOLFIRINOXforpatientswithlocally
advanced pancreatic cancer. Two important unanswered
questions are (a) will the benefit in response rate and overall
survival in the metastatic setting translate to patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer? and (b) are curative-intent
resections possible in patients who respond to treatment? In
thisreport,wepresentourinstitutionalexperienceinpatients
with exclusively locally advanced pancreatic cancer treated
with FOLFIRINOX.

**METHODS**
All patients with a diagnosis of locally advanced pancreatic
cancer (LAPC) who began treatment with FOLFIRINOX at the
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Cancer Center betweenJuly2010andFebruary2012wereidentifiedbysearchingthecancercenterpharmacydatabaseunderaminimalrisk
study approved by the institutional review board. MGH is a
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-designated
institution and follows the NCCN definition of unresectable,
which includes those with distant metastases, metastases to
lymph nodes beyond the resection field, and then varies accordingtodiseaselocationinthehead,body,ortailofthepancreas, but including �180 degree encasement of the superior
mesenteric artery, unreconstructable superior mesenteric
vein or portal vein occlusion, aortic invasion, or celiac encasement [12].
For those patients receiving full-dose FOLFIRINOX, dosing
was as per the phase III trial of FOLFIRINOX [11], with 5-FU administeredasabolusof400mg/m[2],bolusleucovorin400mg/
m[2], followed by continuous infusion at 1200 mg/m[2] per day
for46hours,oxaliplatin85mg/m[2],andirinotecan180mg/m[2].
Prophylactic pegfilgrastim was administered to all patients 24
hours after the 46-hour infusion in all cycles containing 5-FU,
oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Although based on clinical status
andorganfunctionatthetimeofstartingFOLFIRINOX,choices
regarding dosing modifications were determined by the individual treating oncologist. If one of these three drugs was
omitted, pegfilgrastim was administered at the discretion of
the treating physician. The approach for all patients included

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisted of four cycles of
FOLFIRINOX, followed by repeat computed tomography (CT)
imaging. If stable disease or better was observed compared
with baseline, an additional four cycles of FOLFIRINOX was
planned. If repeat CT imaging again revealed stable disease or
better, all patients were recommended to undergo chemoradiation. For all patients, treatment was continued until diseaseprogression,patientpreference,orlimitingtoxicities.For
patients receiving chemoradiation following neoadjuvant
FOLFIRINOX,aradiosensitizingchemotherapy,suchascontinuous infusion 5-FU or capecitabine, was employed along with
intensity-modulated radiation therapy delivered to 50.4 Gy in
28 fractions. Multidisciplinary review with radiology, surgery,
radiation oncology, and medical oncology was performed for
baseline scans and for scans following completion of chemoradiation treatment.

gency department visits (or hospitalizations) were tabulated.
Formalradiographicreviewwasretrospectivelyperformedto
determine overall response rates (ORRs). Patients were assessed for tumor response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines (RECIST, version 1.1)

[13]. The images were consensus-read by two radiologists,
with 6 and 15 years experience. We compared measurable
target lesions (TLs), which are defined as soft-tissue lesions
that could be accurately measured in at least one dimension,
with the largest diameter being at least 1 cm or at least 1.5 cm
intheshortaxisforlymphnodes.Progressivedisease(PD)was
considered when there was at least a 20% increase in the sum
of the total size of TLs or the presence of a new unequivocal
metastatic disease, partial response (PR) when there was at
leasta30%decreaseinthetotalsizeofTLs,andstabledisease
(SD) when there was any percent change between �19% and
�29% in the sum of the total size of TLs. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from the date of FOLFIRINOX to the
earliest of the following: date of radiographic progression (local or metastatic), appearance of metastatic disease at surgical exploration, or death. Patients without radiographic
progressionwerecensoredatthetimeoflastradiographs.PFS
estimateswereobtainedusingtheKaplan-Meiermethod,and
Greenwood’s formula was used to obtain two-sided 95% confidence intervals. All patients receiving FOLFIRINOX were
eligible for toxicity analysis. Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize data from the above analyses.

**RESULTS**
Twenty-two patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer
received FOLFIRINOX at the MGH Cancer Center in the 20month period spanning July 2010 to February 2012. Baseline
demographic and clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1.
Themedianageofpatientswas63years(range:49–78years),
including 13 men and 9 women. All patients except one were

Atotalof178cyclesofchemotherapyweregiventothe22
patients, of which 156 cycles contained all three active drugs
(5-FU, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin). Sixty-six cycles were with

drugs were included (Table 2). Patients received a median of
2.5 full-dose FOLFIRINOX cycles. Of the 17 patients who received 5-FU, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin on the first cycle, 13
received full doses of each drug, including the 5-FU bolus of
400mg/m[2]. Following FOLFIRINOX, all but two patients received fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation (Table 2). In

**DISCUSSION**
This is the largest published series of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX. Recently,
the activity of FOLFIRINOX in patients with borderline or locally advanced pancreatic cancer was reported [15], which includedatotalof18patients,ofwhom14hadlocallyadvanced
disease.Inthese14patients,fourpatientsproceededdirectly
to surgery after 3–12 cycles of FOLFIRINOX, and two of these
14 had an R0 resection. An additional three patients underwent R0 resections after completing chemoradiation treatment. Thus, the R0 resection rate in this case series, excluding
thepatientswithborderlineresectabledisease,was36%(5of
14 patients). Our R0 resection rate of 23% (5 of 22 patients) is
in the range reported by Hosein et al. [15] and may reflect a
neweraofconvertinglocallyadvancedpancreaticcancerinto
resectable pancreatic cancer with the use of FOLFIRINOX.
Given the superior activity of FOLFIRINOX in comparison
with gemcitabine, it is extremely important to establish the
activity and toxicity of FOLFIRINOX in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Our experience raises at least four
important issues. The first major issue involves the subjective
definition of locally advanced and borderline pancreatic cancer. The R0 resection rates range from 8%–64% in 510 patients from 13 studies employing various neoadjuvant
chemoradiation protocols for unresectable pancreatic cancer

[16].DespitethelargediscrepancyinR0resectionrates,overall survival is similar between the studies, suggesting that the
extreme heterogeneity in resection rates observed in this
meta-analysis is due more to the subjective definition of borderlineandlocallyadvanceddisease.Ourseriesisrestrictedto
patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer as determinedbyanexperiencedpancreaticsurgerygroup.Itiscritical
that future studies separate patients with locally advanced
and borderline resectable disease. In addition to evaluating
these two categories separately, establishing formal consensus criteria for locally advanced and borderline disease is of
critical importance. At present, one institution’s locally advanced pancreatic cancer may be considered a borderline resectable patient in another institution. The uneven definition
and application of criteria used to assign categories to the radiographic presentation of patients with pancreatic cancer
probably introduces the greatest amount of variability in the
percentage of patients who can undergo a potential curative

borderline pancreatic cancer, which are defined by NCCN
guidelines specifically by location in the pancreatic head,
body, or tail [12]. As of yet, however, there has not been complete acceptance of and adoption of these criteria. At MGH,
we have a multidisciplinary meeting with radiology, surgery,
radiation oncology, and medical oncology, during which the
imaging, consisting of a pancreatic-protocol CT, is reviewed in
detail to assign a stage based on NCCN criteria. A major criticism of the current study is the lack of an independent review
board assessing our adherence to these criteria.
A second important issue involves the contribution and
sequencing of chemoradiation following neoadjuvant
FOLFIRINOX. In our study, with the exception of one patient
with progressive disease and another who declined chemoradiation, all patients proceeded to chemoradiation after
FOLFIRINOX. In the Hosein et al. study [15], a subset of patients were brought directly to the operating room for
attempted resection following maximal response to FOLFIRINOX; interestingly, only half of these patients (two of four
patients)wereabletohaveR0resections.Althoughchemoradiation may ultimately prove essential for R0 resections, critics argue that this window of time could allow for
micrometastatic disease, previously controlled via FOLFIRINOX, to develop. Importantly, our experience suggests that
thisisanuncommonevent.Thetimingandsequencingofneoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation is an active deb t t ll ti ti


Third, it is critical to assess the tolerability of FOLFIRINOX
specifically in patients with locally advanced disease who often have compromised biliary drainage prior to embarking on
amulti-institutionalstudy.Withmorethan30%ofpatientsrequiring an emergency department visit or admission during
FOLFIRINOX treatment, this regimen is quite toxic in a patient
population that is considered technically incurable. Although a
third of these hospitalizations were brief admissions for diarrhea/dehydration, there were two admissions for non-neutropenic bacteremia. Reassuringly, with the use of prophylactic
growthfactorwithallcyclesofFOLFIRINOXinthisseries,there
were no cases of febrile neutropenia. Given our experience,
upfront dose modification of the FOLFIRINOX regimen might
be necessary, particularly in less well-selected populations of
patients. Currently, the impact on dose reductions, such as
elimination of the 5-FU bolus, is unknown, both in terms of efficacyandtoxicity.Thereasonforthelargediscrepancyinfulldose FOLFIRINOX cycles in our study (37% of cycles) and the
Hosein et al. study (83% of cycles) [15] is unknown, but it may
relate to differences in patient selection, including age and
performance status. In addition, approximately one-third of
patients had borderline disease in the Hosein et al. study,
whereasallpatientsinourstudyhadlocallyadvanceddisease.
A limitation of this retrospective analysis is that we cannot accurately grade subjective complaints such as peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, and diarrhea from the medical record.
Retrospective data on subjective toxicities is inherently incomplete and unreliable and, thus, was not included. Although of clear importance to a discussion of tolerability of a
newer chemotherapy regimen such as FOLFIRINOX, an accurate assessment of the frequency and severity of these side effectsmustbeassessedprospectively.
A final and more basic question is whether a patient with
initiallyunresectablediseasewhoachievesanR0resectionafterneoadjuvantFOLFIRINOXisreallycurable.Wouldpalliative
systemic chemotherapy and/or chemoradiation achieve the
same outcome, avoiding the known morbidity and potential
mortality of surgical resection? In our series, three of the five
patients with an R0 resection developed distance recurrence
at a median of 81 days after surgery. Although we share the
enthusiasm that neoadjuvant therapy may permit resection
for patients with initially unresectable disease, these early results remind us that the vast majority of patients with pancreatic cancer have systemic disease.
Investigation of biomarkers that may allow for prediction
of local versus systemic recurrence could prove helpful in decisions regarding chemoradiation for these patients. For example, an autopsy series found a strong association between
local recurrence and an intact DPC4 gene [17]. If this finding is
corroborated in other larger studies, chemoradiation could be
reserved for patients with intact DPC4. Searching for additional
biomarkers that might allow for prediction of response to and
toxicity from FOLFIRINOX, as well as benefit from chemoradiation, would be helpful in personalizing therapies with ample potentialtobothimproveresponseandreduceharm.
Our institutional experience with FOLFIRINOX should
serve as a template for future clinical trials designed to definitively address the utility of FOLFIRINOX for patients with both
locallyadvancedandborderlineresectablepancreaticcancer.
