**Purpose**
To evaluate response rate and toxicity of irinotecan and oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil (FU) and
leucovorin (Folfirinox) in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (APA).

**Patients and Methods**
Chemotherapy-naive patients with histologically proven APA and bidimensionally measurable disease were treated with Folfirinox therapy every 2 weeks, which comprised oxaliplatin
85 mg/m[2] and irinotecan 180 mg/m[2] plus leucovorin 400 mg/m[2] followed by bolus FU 400
mg/m[2] on day 1, then FU 2,400 mg/m[2] as a 46-hour continuous infusion. Quality of life (QOL)
was assessed using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of
Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30).

**Results**
Forty-seven patients were entered, and 46 received treatment. Thirty-five patients (76%) had
metastatic disease. A total of 356 cycles were delivered, with a median of eight cycles per
patient (range, one to 24 cycles). All patients were assessable for safety. No toxic death
occurred. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 52% of patients, including two patients with
febrile neutropenia. Other relevant toxicities included grade 3 to 4 nausea (20%), vomiting
(17%), and diarrhea (17%) and grade 3 neuropathy (15%; Levi’s scale). The confirmed
response rate was 26% (95% CI, 13% to 39%), including 4% complete responses. Median
time to progression was 8.2 months (95% CI, 5.3 to 11.6 months), and median overall
survival was 10.2 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 14.4 months). Between baseline and end of
treatment, patients had improvement in all functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30, except
cognitive functioning. Responders had major improvement in global QOL.

**Conclusion**
With a good safety profile, a promising response rate, and an improvement in QOL, Folfirinox
will be further assessed in a phase III trial.

**INTRODUCTION**


Pancreatic cancer ranks as the fourth leading
cause of cancer deaths in the Western world.
There are an estimated 30,000 deaths in the
United States[1] and 50,000 deaths per year in
Europe.[2] Because of the aggressiveness of pan

creatic cancers and the lack of effective systemic therapies, only 1% to 4% of patients
with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas will be
alive 5 years after diagnosis.[1,3] Advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (APA) remains an incurable disease with few good treatment
options. However, two randomized trials


-----

demonstrated that chemotherapy improves both survival and
quality of life (QOL) compared with best supportive care
(BSC).[4,5] A randomized trial comparing gemcitabine with 30minute infusion fluorouracil (FU) demonstrated a modest
significantsurvivaladvantageforthegemcitabinegroup.[6] Several attempts at developing more efficacious gemcitabinebasedregimenshavebeencarriedout,butdespiteencouraging
results from phase II trials, randomized studies to date have
not shown a survival benefit for combination chemotherapy
over gemcitabine alone.[7-15] Therefore, new effective and welltolerated regimens are warranted.
Irinotecan, a camptothecin analog, has been demonstrated to have a higher growth inhibitory effect against cultured pancreatic adenocarcinoma than cisplatin, mitomycin,
and FU.[16] Preclinical studies have indicated a synergy when
irinotecan precedes FU-leucovorin exposure.[17-19] Other studies have shown high activity of irinotecan on pancreatic tumor
cells in culture and in xenografts.[20,21] Irinotecan has been
investigated as a single agent in patients with nonpretreated APA, producing response rates from 9% to
27%.[22-24] Some activity as second-line chemotherapy has
also been reported.[25,26]

Oxaliplatin, a platinum-based drug, also inhibits pancreatic tumor cell lines.[27] When used as a single agent,
oxaliplatin has minimal activity against APA, but a 10%
response rate has been described when it was used with
FU.[28] In vitro, synergistic activity has been described between irinotecan and oxaliplatin.[29,30] Differences in mechanism of action of oxaliplatin and irinotecan, combined
with the demonstrated antitumor activity of each agent,
suggest that coadministration of oxaliplatin and irinotecan
to patients with APA may provide clinical outcomes superior
to those obtained with either drug administered alone. Furthermore, with the exception of myelosuppression and diarrhea, the two drugs have no overlapping clinical toxicity.
One previous phase I trial[31] evaluated a triplet combination of leucovorin plus bolus and continuous-infusion
FU (LV5FU),[32] irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. The recommended doses were oxaliplatin 85 mg/m[2], irinotecan 180
mg/m[2], and full doses of simplified LV5FU. Of five patients
with APA, one complete response (CR) and one partial
response (PR) were observed. On the basis of these encouraging results, a multicenter phase II study of the oxaliplatin
and irinotecan plus LV5FU combination (Folfirinox) was
conducted by the Gastrointestinal Tumor Group of the
French Anticancer Centers. The main objectives were to
assess the efficacy and safety of the Folfirinox combination
as first-line treatment in patients with APA.


**PATIENTS AND METHODS**


**_Patients Selection_**
Eligible patients were required to have histologically or cytologically proven APA, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic


disease, at least one bidimensionally measurable lesion according
to WHO criteria,[33] no previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, an
age between 18 and 70 years, a WHO performance status (PS) less
than 2, and adequate bone marrow, liver (total bilirubin � 1.5 �
the upper limits of normal [ULN], AST and ALT � 3 � UNL, and
alkaline phosphatases � 3 � ULN or � 5 � ULN in case of liver
involvement), and renal function (creatinine � 130 �mol/L).
Surgical unresectability was defined by laparotomy or by multidisciplinary consultation looking at radiologic criteria as extrapancreatic disease or celiac or superior mesenteric artery involvement.
Written informed consent was required, and the ethical committee approved the study. Patients with CNS metastases, second
malignancies, and a history of chronic diarrhea, angina pectoris,
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria grade
greater than 1 peripheral neuropathy, or psychiatric disorders
were excluded.

**_Chemotherapy_**
Folfirinox consisted of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m[2] diluted in 5%
dextrose administered as a 2-hour intravenous infusion followed
by irinotecan 180 mg/m[2] administered as a 90-minute infusion in
dextrose 5% 500 mL or normal saline 1 hour after the end of
oxaliplatin infusion. The simplified LV5FU regimen was administered after the irinotecan infusion as follows: leucovorin 400
mg/m[2] over 2 hours followed by FU 400 mg/m[2] bolus, then FU
2,400 mg/m[2] was administered as a 46-hour continuous infusion.
Treatment cycles were repeated every 2 weeks.
Antiemetic prophylaxis was left to investigator’s discretion.
In case of severe cholinergic syndrome, preventive treatment with
atropine (0.25 mg subcutaneously) was to be administered at all
subsequent cycles. If patients experienced delayed diarrhea, early
high-dose loperamide was prescribed according to specific guidelines, and if diarrhea persisted more than 48 hours, prophylactic
oral fluoroquinolones were administered. In case of severe neutropenia and/or no recovery to grade less than 1 at day 14, further
cycles could be administered with a granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF).
Patients were assessed for toxicity before each cycle. Chemotherapy was delayed until recovery if neutrophils were less than
1.5 � 10[9]/L or platelets were less than 100 � 10[9]/L. Doses adjustments were made according to nadir values and time of recovery to
a grade � 1. Doses reductions were also recommended in case of
grade 3 to 4 diarrhea, stomatitis, hand and foot syndrome, and
vomiting and/or in case of grade 2 peripheral neuropathy. For any
other nonhematologic toxicity that occurred with grade � 2, a
maximum delay of treatment of 2 weeks was allowed to attempt
recovery to grade � 1. Once the dose was decreased, re-escalation
was not permitted. Patients went off study if they required more
than two dose reductions.
Treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal. Twelve cycles were recommended in responding patients, and patients were observed every
3 months until death or cutoff date.

**_Efficacy Assessment_**
The primary efficacy end point was response rate, which was
defined as the sum of CR and PR assessed according to WHO
criteria.[33] CR was defined as the complete disappearance of all
assessable disease, and PR was defined as a decrease of at least 50%
of the sum of the products of the diameters of measurable lesions.
Responses had to be confirmed by repeat assessments performed
no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met.


_www.jco.org_ **1229**


-----

Stable disease was defined as a decrease of less than 50% or an
increase of less than 25% in measurable lesions, and progressive
disease was defined as an increase of at least 25% in measurable
lesions or the appearance of new malignant lesion(s). Computed
tomography scan imaging was performed at baseline and then
every 6 weeks until disease progression. Patients who were withdrawn from study before the first evaluation were classified as
having experienced treatment failure. All computed tomography
scans were reviewed by an external response review committee
(ERRC), which was a panel of two independent radiologists not
involved in the study. Secondary efficacy end points included the
duration of response and stabilization, time to progression, and
overall survival. Time to progression was calculated from the start
of treatment to the first day of progression. Survival lasted from
the date of inclusion until death.

**_Safety Assessment_**
Patients who received at least one infusion were assessable for
safety. For hematologic and biologic parameters, at least one measure per cycle was required. Toxic effects (except paresthesias)
were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 1.0. Peripheral sensitive neuropathy was
graded according to Levi’s specific grading.[34]

**_QOL and Clinical Benefit Assessment_**
QOL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30
(EORTC QLQ-C30, version 3.0). The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30item questionnaire including five functional scales, three symptom scales, one QOL scale, and six single items on common
symptoms.[35] The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire was distributed to the patients before each cycle and at the end of the treatment. Questionnaires were scored according to the EORTC
instructions.[36] Baseline and last available questionnaires were
compared. The primary objective was to analyze changes in global
QOL, and secondary objectives were to describe changes in fatigue, pain, physical functioning, and emotional functioning.
These scales were chosen because they are the most deteriorated in
APA patients according to the EORTC reference values manual.[37]

Clinical benefit response was evaluated according to assessment of
consumption of pain-relieving drugs, weight trends, or evolution
of asthenia or anorexia.

**_Statistical Considerations_**
According to a Simon two-stage phase II optimal design[38] for
a goal of 25% true response rate with an �and �error probability
of .05 and .20, respectively, an accrual of at least 40 eligible patients
assessable for response was planned. Assuming that 15% of patients would be inassessable, 46 patients needed to be included. An
early termination of the study was required if less than three
responses were observed in the first 22 patients. Otherwise, recruitment continued. The 95% CI for response was calculated.
Time-related parameters, including median follow-up time, were
analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.[39,40]


tics of the 46 treated patients are listed in Table 1. The
median age was 56 years (range, 40 to 69 years), and 76% of
patients had stage IVb disease at diagnosis. Among 11 patients with locally advanced disease, two patients had celiac
artery involvement, one patient had local recurrence, and
eight patients had unresectable tumor assessed during explorative laparotomy. Thirty-four patients (74%) had an
impaired PS, and 39 patients (85%) were suffering at least
from one disease-related symptom at study entry.

**_Study Treatment and Drug Delivery_**
A total of 356 cycles were completed (median, eight
cycles per patient; range, one to 24 cycles). Doses reductions
were required in 50 cycles (14%), and the main reasons for
dose reduction were hematologic toxicity, neurotoxicity,
and diarrhea (Table 2). Short treatment delays (� 7 days)
occurred in 48 cycles (13%), and longer delays (� 7 days)
occurred in 66 cycles (19%). Those delays were mainly a

In 25 cycles (22%), delays were unrelated to study treatment. The delivered relative dose-intensity per patient was
82% for oxaliplatin, 84% for irinotecan, and 83% for FU.

**_Objective Response and Survival_**
Response rate was evaluated in all treated patients.
After the first 22 assessable patients were treated, four confirmed objective responses were observed and, thus, accrual
could continue. Overall results are listed in Table 3. Twelve
PRs (26%) and 18 stabilizations (39%) were observed by the
investigators, resulting in an overall response rate of 26%
(95% CI, 13% to 39%). Three (27.3%) of 11 patients with
local APA and nine of 35 patients with metastatic disease
achieved a confirmed response. This was confirmed by the
ERRC, with two CRs (4%), 10 PRs (22%), and 16 patients
with stable disease (35%). With a median follow-up of 33
months, the median response duration was 10.4 months
(95% CI, 9.0 to 15.2 months), and median progression-free

survival (PFS) was 5.6 months (95% CI, 3.4 to 9.0 months)
according to the investigators. According to the ERRC,
median response duration was 9.3 months (95% CI, 8.2 to
13.6 months), median PFS was 8.2 months (95% CI, 5.3 to
11.6 months), and median duration of stable disease was 7.5
months (95% CI, 5.1 to 15.1 months). When tumor progressed, 31 patients (67%) received a second-line treatment, including gemcitabine (n � 18), radiochemotherapy
(n � 4), Folfiri (irinotecan, bolus- and continuous-infusion
FU; n � 3), gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (n � 1), Folfox
(oxaliplatin, bolus- and continuous-infusion FU; n � 1),
and FU-leucovorin (n � 1). After having stopped chemotherapy, three patients who responded to Folfirinox received Folfirinox again when they progressed.
Median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI, 8.1
to 14.4 months); in metastatic patients, the median overall
survival was 9.5 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 13.7 months, and in
locally advanced patients, it was 15.7 months (95% CI, 8.9
to 43 months). The 1-year survival rate was 43% for the
whole group (Fig 1). Six patients (including three patients
with metastatic disease) are still alive, with a mean
follow-up of �30 months (range, �26 to �33 months).

**DISCUSSION**


APA remains an incurable disease, and weekly gemcitabine
has been widely adopted today as the standard of care in
first-line chemotherapy for APA, with median survival limited to the range of 4.6 to 6.6 months in randomized
studies.[7-10,12,14,15,42-45] Multivariate Cox regression analysis
identified prognostic factors for survival, mainly PS, extent
of disease (nonmetastatic v metastatic), albumin level, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatases, age, tumor differentiation, and appetite loss.[7,43,44,46] Until now, no
randomized trial has shown a significant QOL benefit or
overall survival superiority for any gemcitabine-based combination over gemcitabine alone.[7-15,43] Therefore, better
systemic therapies are warranted.
In this study, we offered Folfirinox for good PS patients
(Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS of 0 and 1). Patients with Karnofsky PS less than 70 have a short median
survival (eg, 2.4 months when treated with gemcitabine)[47]

and were not eligible for this potentially toxic regimen. In


this selected population, Folfirinox regimen seems promising and has a favorable tolerance profile. Despite a high rate
of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (52% of patients, 22% per
cycle), only two cases of febrile neutropenia occurred. Hematologic toxicities resulted in 9% of cycles with dose reduction and 21% delayed cycles. These results may be
improved with a larger use of G-CSF because only three
patients received prophylactic G-CSF. The other toxicities
were manageable, and no toxic deaths occurred.
Because of a frequent desmoplastic reaction in APA,
tumor response assessment is difficult, especially in locally
advanced disease. However, there was no major difference
between the investigators and the ERRC conclusions. The
encouraging response rate of 26% (CI 95%, 13% to 39%)
with Folfirinox was similar in locally advanced disease
(27.3%) and in metastatic disease (25.7%). In our study, all
responses were confirmed by a second assessment and were
independently reviewed. Two CRs, a rare event in APA,
were observed (durations of 11 and 12 months). The overall
response duration of 9.3 months (CI 95%, 8.2 to 13.6
months) is also encouraging. The overall tumor growth
control was 61%, with a duration of 9.3 months (CI 95%,
7.8 to 11.7 months). Although second-line chemotherapy is
often considered ineffective in APA, it was offered to 67% of
patients, and one can not completely rule out some clinical
impact resulting in an improved survival.

Patient QOL can be greatly reduced by side effects of
chemotherapy or symptoms of APA, which include severe
pain, depression, weight loss, loss of appetite, and fatigue.
QOL was measured in our study with the EORTC QLQC30. As in all studies, the major problem with QOL assessment was the compliance, and eight questionnaires were
lacking at baseline. However, the attrition rate was low, and
at the end of treatment, data were available for all patients
except two. All functional scales improved during treatment, except cognitive functioning. The greatest improvement in median scores was seen for role functioning, social
functioning, and global QOL. Responders had the greatest
improvement, with a median improvement of 25 points in
global QOL, which is a major change according to Osoba
criteria.[41] The median score of fatigue remained stable, and
pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, and constipation
were improved. The only item that deteriorated during
treatment was diarrhea.
Until now, few studies have demonstrated a QOL improvement with chemotherapy in APA. In 1996, Glimelius
et al[5] reported on 53 patients randomly assigned to receive
chemotherapy (FU and leucovorin with or without etoposide) plus BSC or BSC alone. Changes in EORTC QLQ-C30
were categorized by two assessors who were unaware of the
patient group assignment. Eleven patients (38%) were considered to have a favorable QOL outcome in the chemotherapy group compared with three patients (13%) in the BSC
group. However, the sample size was small, and the QOL
evaluation was limited to the first 4 months. Most of the
further studies showed a rapid degradation in QOL during
chemotherapy, probably mostly because of tumor progression. In only one study, global QOL at 24 weeks was
significantly superior to the pretreatment value with a FUmitomycin combination.[46] The pain and dyspnea scores
were also improved. Two studies have formally assessed
QOL during gemcitabine treatment. Results are contradictory, with improvement of QOL in one study[8] and worsening of QOL at 4 and 8 weeks in another.[44]

Other trials have assessed irinotecan or oxaliplatin in
APA. The combination of gemcitabine plus irinotecan is
active in APA.[48] A randomized phase III study comparing
gemcitabine alone to gemcitabine-irinotecan was recently
published.[12] The confirmed response rate was significantly
better in the two-drug regimen than with gemcitabine alone
(16.1% v 4.4%, respectively; P � .001). However, there was
no difference in PFS, overall survival, and QOL. The efficacy
of oxaliplatin was tested in a three-arm randomized phase II
study comparing oxaliplatin 130 mg/m[2], FU 1 g/m[2]/d continuous infusion for 4 days, and the two drugs combined;
the response rates were 0%, 0%, and 10% respectively.
Tolerance was excellent, and the median survival of 9
months in the oxaliplatin-FU arm was encouraging.[28]

Sixty-two patients were treated in a Groupe d’Etude et


de Recherche Clinique en Oncologie et Radiothérapie
(GERCOR) phase II study with a fixed dose-rate infusion of
gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m[2] as a 10 mg/m[2]/min infusion on
day 1 and oxaliplatin 100 mg/m[2] on day 2 every 2 weeks
(Gemox). The response rate was 30.6%.[49] Using 3-week
Gemox schedule, the North Central Cancer Treatment
Group[50] had a response rate of only 10.9%. The differences
in these results suggest that the manner in which the drugs
are administered influences the regimen’s efficacy. An ongoing three-arm phase III study by the Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group will better clarify both the benefits of the
fixed dose-rate infusion of gemcitabine and the added benefit of oxaliplatin. A randomized phase III study comparing
the GERCOR’s Gemox combination to standard weekly
gemcitabine was recently presented.[11] Of 313 eligible patients, the response rate according the investigators was
26.8% for the Gemox combination versus 17.3% for gemcitabine alone (P � .02); PFS was 5.8 and 3.7 months,
respectively (P � .038). However, no significant increase in
survival was observed, and QOL was not measured.
In conclusion, the Folfirinox regimen seems promising
for good PS patients. The objective response rate was 26%,
including two CRs, and tumor control was achieved in 61%
of patients. The median duration of response (9.3 months)
and the median survival (10.2 months) are encouraging.
Toxicity, which was mainly hematologic, was manageable,
and an improvement in almost all the EORTC QLQ-C30
QOL domains was observed. This investigational combination is now tested in an ongoing phase II to III trial versus
gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
