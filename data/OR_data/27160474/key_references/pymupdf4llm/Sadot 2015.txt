### Abstract

**Background—FOLFIRINOX therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has been**
reported to result in objective response rates that are 2–3 fold higher than other regimens. Our goal
was to assess response rates and resection rates in locally unresectable (stage III) patients initially
treated with induction FOLFIRINOX.


**Methods—The institutional cancer database was queried for patients treated with induction**
FOLFIRINOX therapy between 2010–2013. Patients were included if they were treated at our
institution for stage III PDAC (locally unresectable) that had been adjudicated at a weekly
multidisciplinary tumor board.


**Results—One hundred and one patients were identified. The median age was 64 years (range:**
37–81) and the median follow-up was 12 months (range:3–37). Patients received a median of six
cycles of induction FOLFIRINOX(range:1–20). No grade 4–5 toxicity was recorded. At initial
restaging(median of 3 months following diagnosis), 23 patients(23%) had developed distant
metastases, 15 patients(15%) underwent resection, and 63 patients(63%) proceeded to
chemoradiation. Within the group of 63patients who proceeded to chemoradiation(median of 9
months following diagnosis), an additional 16 patients(16%) underwent resection and 5(5%)
developed metastases. A partial radiographic response was observed in 29% of all patients, which
was associated with the ability to perform resection(p=0.004). The median overall survival within
the group who progressed on FOLFIRINOX and the group who did not progress were 11 and
26months, respectively.

### INTRODUCTION

A recently completed phase III randomized trial for stage IV PDAC identified
FOLFIRINOX to be superior to gemcitabine with respect to radiographic response along
with improved progression-free and overall survival[1]. Patients who received FOLFIRINOX
experienced a 32% objective response rate (ORR) compared to 9% in the gemcitabine arm,
which correlated with survival benefit (median overall survival and progression-free
survival: 11 and 6 months vs 7 and 3 months, respectively). Retrospective studies of patients
with both borderline resectable PDAC (stage I–II) and stage III patients(locally
unresectable) have also suggested an ORR of approximately 30% with FOLFIRINOX[2,3].
The reported ORR from non-FOLFIRINOX regimens has generally been in the range of
10%, including the results of a phase II study from our institution that demonstrated a 10%
ORR for resectable patients treated with preoperative gemcitabine and oxaliplatin therapy[4].


Conversion from unresectable to resectable disease with induction therapy is an important
therapeutic goal for stage III patients, which studies suggest is associated with improved
survival[5]. During the pre-FOLFIRINOX era, the conversion rates of stage III patients with
induction therapy ranged between 7–19%[6–13]. Currently, the resectability rates after
induction FOLFIRINOX for stage III PDAC are not established, as recent series assessing
FOLFIRINOX for non-metastatic patients have been either single-arm surgical series with a
denominator limited to selected patients who were taken to the operating room, or series
composed of a heterogonous population that included both resectable and locally
unresectable patients[14].

The current study design attempted to overcome these limitations by identifying all stage III
PDAC patients treated with induction FOLFIRINOX therapy at our institution, whether or
not their tumor was resected. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of
FOLFIRINOX induction therapy for all patients who presented with stage III PDAC (locally
unresectable) and were treated with induction FOLFIRINOX therapy at our institution
between 2010 and 2013. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the radiographic
response and resection rates after induction therapy with FOLFIRINOX.


### METHODS

**Study design**

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. A search of our institutional
cancer database for patients who initially presented with stage III PDAC and then were
treated with induction FOLFIRINOX therapy was performed. This search identified 106

patients who were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) between
2010–2013. Five patients were excluded by chart review, as three patients were considered
borderline resectable (encasement of the portal vein accompanied by marked
lymphadenopathy) and another two patients were excluded because subsequent biopsy
identified extra-regional nodal involvement. Treatment related variables were obtained from
the database and confirmed by chart review.

The classification of stage III disease was defined according to the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network definitions[15]. Only patients categorized as T4, any N, M0 were included.
No patients had extra-regional metastatic disease. Further description of findings consistent
with local unresectability included the following: greater than 180 degrees SMA
encasement, any celiac abutment, inferior vena cava, unreconstructable SMV/portal
occlusion, and aortic invasion or encasement. All patients who were included had an
unambiguous clinic note from the attending surgeon and/or the medical oncologist that
stated the disease was stage III according to the above mentioned definitions, which were
further verified by evaluation of the cross-sectional imaging reports. In addition, all patients
were reviewed at a multidisciplinary conference, where imaging was reviewed and treatment
strategy recommended. The treatment schema is presented in Figure 1A. FOLFIRINOX
induction therapy was administered with a starting dose intensity 80% from that used in the
PRODIGE/ACCORD trial[1]. Dose reductions or delays were instituted at the discretion of the
treating medical oncologist. Typically, restaging CT and CA 19-9 measurements were
performed to assess tumor response and resectability after 4 cycles. At this point, conversion
to resectable disease was reassessed at the multidisciplinary meeting. Decisions were made
on a case-by-case basis. Distant progression was defined as new distant metastases, which
was determined either by imaging or at surgical exploration. Patients who appeared to
convert to resectable disease underwent surgical exploration and patients with stable disease
were typically initiated with chemoradiotherapy(CRT). Similarly, all patients who appeared
to convert to resectable disease after CRT went on to surgical exploration. When distant
progression occurred under induction therapy or when disease remained unresectable after
completion of the protocol, patients typically continued with systemic therapy or were
managed with best supportive care.


Radiographic response was evaluated in a prospective manner by two radiologists. Response
was reported according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines
(RECIST, version 1.1)[16]. Objective response rate(ORR) was defined as the percentage of
patients who had a decrease >30% in the greatest dimension of the primary tumor or
complete disappearance of the primary tumor. Pathologic response was also recorded, and
the guidelines utilized for determining this response have been previously reported[5].

Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute criteria[17]. Only toxicities
above grade 1 were recorded. Operative morbidity is recorded and graded in the MSKCC
Surgical Events database[18], which uses a severity scale similar to others previously
published[19].

**Data analysis**

Descriptive and comparative statistics were performed using Statistical Software for the
Social Sciences(SPSS) version 22 software. Continuous variables were compared using the
Student t test or Mann-Whitney test, as appropriate by the type of distribution. Categorical
variables were compared using χ2 or the Fisher exact test depending on the number of
observations. A p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Survival distributions were
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Time to event was calculated from initiation date
of induction therapy with FOLFIRINOX to date of event. An event for progression-free
survival(PFS) was defined as distant progression, recurrence (for resected patients), or death.
Patients without the event of interest at last follow-up were censored.


### RESULTS


During the three-year study period (July 2010 to October 2013), 101 patients were identified
who were treated at our institution for stage III PDAC with induction FOLFIRINOX.
Demographics and pretreatment tumor characteristics are summarized in Table 1A. The
median age of all patients was 64 years (range:37–81 years), 52% were male, and 95% were
ECOG 0-1. The median pretreatment diameter of the primary tumor was 3.5cm (range:1.6–
8.9), which significantly decreased to a median diameter of 3cm (range:1.4–8; p<0.001) at
the completion of FOLFIRINOX therapy. The pattern of vascular involvement that
precluded resection differed between those who proceeded to resection and those who did
not(p<0.001). Celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery(SMA), and multiple vessel
involvement were more common in the group that did not proceed to resection whereas
hepatic artery and unreconstructable venous involvement were more common in the group
that experienced response and proceeded to resection. No difference between the groups was
noted for pretreatment regional lymph nodes status, CA 19-9, or CEA levels.

Induction therapy with FOLFIRINOX consisted of a median of six cycles(range:1–20)
lasting 13 weeks(range:2–43). Toxicity above grade 1 was recorded for 50% and the highest
toxicity grade was 3. No difference was noted between the groups who experienced response
and proceeded to resection and those who did not with respect to the grade of toxicity(Table
1B). Dose reductions or delays were required in 45% of the patients. Resectability was
associated with tumor size reduction >10%(p=0.006), and with greater than 50% reduction
in CA 19-9 (p=0.001) after FOLFIRINOX induction therapy(Table 1B and Figure 2).
Representative images from patients with response to FOLFIRINOX alone, are presented in
Figure 1B–C. Upon completion of the initial FOLFIRINOX induction course, 16 patients
underwent surgical exploration and 15(15%) underwent tumor resection(Figure 1A). Distant
progression developed in 23 patients (23%) and the remaining 63 patients underwent
chemoradiation. Within this group of 63 patients, five developed overt metastases following
chemoradiation, 16 underwent tumor resection, and 42 had stable unresectable disease.


Table 2 summarizes the results of all patients upon completion of FOLFIRINOX induction
therapy with or without chemoradiation. Resectability was associated with post-treatment
tumor size, nodal status, or decrease in CA 19-9 level. The ORR was 29%(20% without
chemoradiation) and approximately 50% of patients who achieved partial response(more
than 30% size reduction) underwent tumor resection. Overall, 31%(31 patients) underwent

tumor resection from which 55%(16 patients) achieved an R0 resection. Median duration of
systemic treatment and/or chemoradiation within the group of patients who underwent
resection was seven months (range:3–15months). Table 3 shows the characteristics of
patients who underwent tumor resection. The selective use of radiation therapy was
associated with lower R0 rates (33% vs. 79%, p=0.02), higher vascular resection rates (47%
vs. 7%, p=0.03), higher pN0 rate (80% vs. 28%, p=0.009), and higher rate of pathological
response greater than 50%(75% vs. 22%, p=0.03). No perioperative mortality occurred.

The median follow-up of our cohort was 12 months (range:3–37). Median overall survival
(OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 25 months (CI:19–31) and 16 months (CI:
14–18), respectively. Patients who progressed during induction FOLFIRINOX therapy
experienced a median OS of 11 months (CI:9–13) and patients who did not progress had a
median OS of 26 months (CI:20–32)(Figure S1). The median OS has not been reached in the
group of patients who underwent tumor resection. Within the group of patients who had
stable disease following systemic therapy and chemoradiation the median survival was 26
months (CI:18–33).


### DISCUSSION

The current study of FOLFIRINOX induction therapy in stage III PDAC patients was
associated with an objective response rate of 20%, which increased to 29% with the selective
use of radiation therapy. In addition, a high proportion (31%) of initially stage III (locally
unresectable) patients were converted to resectable disease. The ability to perform resection
was associated with either radiographic response or a reduction in serum CA19-9. The
safety profile of this regimen within this group of patients was encouraging with no grade 4–
5 toxicities. Only 14% of patients experienced grade 3 toxicity.


The present study was designed to evaluate only those patients who were deemed locally
unresectable (stage III) at the time of diagnosis. Patients with borderline resectable tumors
(stage I–II) were excluded. Defining the differences between borderline resectable and
locally unresectable tumors is challenging, especially in a retrospective study. In order to
minimize selection bias and possible inclusion of borderline resectable patients, the
institutional cancer database was queried for all stage III patients treated with
FOLFIRINOX. In addition, tumor stage was verified by medical chart and imaging report
review. Only patients with an unambiguous clinic note that defined locally unresectable
disease were included, and all of the included patients were reviewed at a multidisciplinary
conference.

Objective response rate (ORR) is often used as a surrogate for outcome. Conroy et al[1 ]


presented results from a randomized phase III trial of stage IV PDAC patients and reported a
superior ORR (32% vs 9%) for FOLFIRINOX compared with single-agent gemcitabine,
which was also associated with improved outcome. A recent phase II study from our
institution reported an ORR of 10% in stage I–II patients treated with preoperative
gemcitabine and oxaliplatin therapy[4]. Similarly, an ORR of 12% was reported by the group
from MD Anderson Cancer Center for borderline resectable patients treated with
gemcitabine based regimens[20]. Only two studies, which included a mix of borderline (stage

I–II) and locally unresectable (stage III) PDAC patients treated initially with FOLFIRINOX,
have reported the ORR of FOLFIRINOX in the non-metastatic setting. A recent report from
the MGH group[3] described 22 patients with an ORR of 27% and a French multicenter study
reported on 77 patients with an ORR of 28%[2]. Our findings of a 20% ORR (without
radiation) and a 29% ORR with selective radiation therapy are similar, and suggest that
response to FOLFIRINOX may be superior to other reported regimens. The above ORRs
display a consistent pattern, in which the ORR with FOLFIRINOX is at least two-fold
higher compared to non-FOLFIRINOX regimens[1,4]. It should be noted however, that a high
ORR(23%) was recently reported in stage IV PDAC patients in a phase III randomized trial
that evaluated a novel regimen of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine[21]. FOLFIRINOX and
gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel have not been compared in a randomized fashion in any disease
setting.

The primary aim of the current study included evaluation of the conversion rate from
unresectable to resectable disease. This therapeutic goal is of importance, as a previous
study by our group has suggested that patients who are able to undergo resection following
initial systemic treatment of stage III disease experience similar survival to those whose
tumors are initially resected[5]. Within the current study, 31% of patients initially deemed
unresectable eventually underwent resection. Similar rates of conversion have also been
reported from other institutions. The group from Pittsburgh[22] reported on 13 stage III PDAC
patients treated with FOLFIRINOX induction therapy, from which 2(15%) underwent
resection and the R0 rate was 50%(1 patient). Hosein et al[23] evaluated 14 stage III PDAC
patients treated with FOLFIRINOX induction therapy, from which 43%(6 patients) were
resected and 83%(5 patients) achieved R0 resection. Ferrone et al.[14] recently reported on 40
patients (both borderline (stage I–II) and locally unresectable (stage III) PDAC patients)
treated with preoperative FOLFIRINOX and concluded that after preoperative
FOLFIRINOX, imaging no longer predicts resectability. These results are interesting,
however since their study only looked at patients who were taken to the operating room it is
unclear what imaging factors were used for this selection in their report. The current study,
which included all patients treated with FOLFIRINOX for stage III PDAC patients found
that resectability was associated with either radiographic response or CA 19-9 reduction.


It does appear that resectability rates are higher following FOLFIRINOX then they are after
non-FOLFIRINOX regimens[6–13], in which the resectability rates for locally unresectable
(stage III) patients treated with induction therapy have ranged between 7%–19%. Small et
al.[9] reported a multi-institutional phase II study, which assessed the efficacy of gemcitabine
with concurrent radiation therapy in nonmetastatic PDAC patients. The authors found that
only 1(7%) of 14 patients who were initially diagnosed with locally unresectable tumor
(stage III) underwent resection after therapy. Although methodological limitations preclude
definitive conclusion, the current results, which identified a resection rate of 31% and a R0
resection rate of 55% in a homogenous group of 101 stage III PDAC patients, suggests that
the response evident after induction FOLFIRINOX therapy may be better than the previous,
primarily gemcitabine-based regimens.

As an observational study, this analysis has inherent selection limitations and the
generalizability of these outcome and toxicity results may well be restricted to selected

patients treated at specialized high volume centers. Therefore, causality cannot be
determined in a non-randomized trial and the selective use of radiation therapy further
compounds the direct effect of FOLFIRINOX treatment. A major advantage of this study is
the intention-to-treat analysis with a denominator that includes all stage III PDAC patients
(locally unresectable) treated with induction FOLFIRINOX therapy, whether or not their
tumor was resected. This is a homogeneous population treated with the same regimen.


### CONCLUSION

This study demonstrates that nearly a third of patients who had been initially identified to
have stage III pancreatic carcinoma and had been treated with FOLFIRINOX responded
radiographically and underwent tumor resection. Radiographic response and reduction in
serum CA19-9 were associated with this outcome. Prospective trials are needed to validate
these results and determine whether they will be translated into survival benefit.
