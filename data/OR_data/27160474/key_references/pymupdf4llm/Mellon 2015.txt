ABSTRACT

Purpose. Limited data are available to guide neoadjuvant treatment of borderline resectable (BRPC) and locally
advanced (LAPC) pancreatic cancer.
Material and methods. We updated our institutional outcomes with a neoadjuvant chemotherapy and stereotactic
body radiotherapy (SBRT) approach. An IRB-approved analysis was performed of all BRPC and LAPC patients treated
with our departmental treatment protocol. After staging, medically fi t patients underwent chemotherapy for 2 – 3 months,
with regimen at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist. Patients then received SBRT delivered in fi ve consecutive daily fractions with median total radiation doses of 30 Gy to tumor and 40 Gy dose painted to tumor-vessel
interfaces. This was followed by restaging imaging for possible resection. Overall survival (OS), event free survival
(EFS), and locoregional control (LRC) rates were estimated and compared by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods.
Results. We identifi ed 159 patients, 110 BRPC and 49 LAPC, with 14.0 months median overall follow-up. The resection and margin negative (R0) rate for BRPC patients who completed neoadjuvant therapy was 51% and 96%, respectively. Estimated median OS was 19.2 months for BRPC patients and 15.0 months for LAPC patients (p � 0.402). Median
OS was 34.2 months for surgically resected patients versus 14.0 months for unresected patients (p � 0.001). Five of 21
(24%) LAPC patients receiving FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy underwent R0 resection. In LAPC, FOLFIRINOX recipients underwent R0 resection more often than other chemotherapy recipients (5 of 21 vs. 0 of 28, p � 0.011). There was
a trend for improved survival in those resected LAPC patients (p � 0.09). For those not undergoing resection, one year
LRC was 78%. Any grade � 3 potentially radiation-related toxicity rate was 7%.
Conclusions. These data underscore the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of neoadjuvant SBRT and chemotherapy
for BRPC and LAPC.


ABSTRACT


Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause
of cancer death in the US [1]. For the most common
exocrine cancers, patients who undergo tumor resection have the best chance of cure, while unresectable
cancers are nearly uniformly fatal [2]. Novel techniques are required to improve the survival and quality of life of patients.
One emerging technique for the treatment of
pancreatic cancer is stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). SBRT is used by specialized centers to


deliver a high dose of precisely targeted radiation in
a short course of therapy [3]. Unresectable locally
advanced pancreatic cancers (LAPC) cause signifi cant pain, obstruction, and other morbidity due to
direct extension of the primary tumor [4]. Utilized
to slow tumor progression, some early SBRT experiences in LAPC of up to 85 patients have demonstrated local control (LC) rates over 80% at one year

[5 – 8]. Borderline resectable pancreatic cancers
(BRPC) involve nearby vasculature with elevated risk

for margin positive (R1) resection and are frequently
treated to improve resectability [9,10]. Neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and sequential SBRT with high dose
to the area of tumor-vessel interface have been
employed in BRPC with high rates of margin negative (R0) resection [11,12].
Evolving combination chemotherapies are also
improving outcomes in pancreatic cancer. Large
randomized trials of the oxaliplatin, irinotecan,
fl uorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX) or
the gemcitabine with nab-paclitaxel regimens
have demonstrated improved survival and radiographic response compared to single agent gemcitabine [13,14]. The gemcitabine, docetaxel, and
capecitabine (GTX) chemotherapy regimen has
also been associated with promising radiographic
responses [15].
These multi-agent chemotherapy regimens are
being applied to earlier stages of pancreatic cancer,
often in sequential fashion with radiotherapy. Initial
experiences with FOLFIRINOX and radiotherapy in
BRPC and LAPC have demonstrated encouraging
results [16 – 19]. The ongoing ALLIANCE-A021101
trial seeks to evaluate in BRPC the safety and outcomes of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX followed by
concurrent capecitabine and conventional radiation
prior to resection with adjuvant gemcitabine.
This report updates the outcomes and toxicity
using induction chemotherapy and SBRT for BRPC
and LAPC in our institutional experience of 159
patients. Several LAPC patients were able to undergo
surgical resection after treatment, and this outcome
was correlated with receipt of FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy.

**Material and methods**

_Initial staging and patients_

After institutional review board approval, an internal
database was queried to identify all patients who
received at least one dose of induction chemotherapy
and SBRT as part of our institutional protocol for
the treatment of BRPC or LAPC. These patients
were treated from 2009 to 2014 and had American
Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition stage IIA-III
adenosquamous or adenocarcinoma. Defi nitions of
anatomic resectability were applied from the 2009
expert consensus statement which were adopted by
the National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) [9].
Staging methods under this protocol have been
previously described [7]. In summary, patients typically undergo physical examination, standard blood
chemistries including CA19-9, multidetector thinslice pancreatic protocol computed tomography
(CT) scan, positron emission tomography (PET)


scan, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), specialist pathology review, and presentation at gastrointestional
tumor board. The highest stage identifi ed by any
imaging modality determined the clinical stage and
treatment. Included BRPC patients were initially
judged fi t to medically tolerate resection without
probable distant metastases. Three clinically T2-T3
classifi cation patients judged unlikely to ever tolerate
resection are included as LAPC patients.

_Chemotherapy treatment_

Patients fi rst received induction chemotherapy at the
discretion of the treating medical oncologist. For
BRPC, patients most commonly received induction
chemotherapy with three 21-day cycles of the GTX
regimen as gemcitabine 750 mg/m [2] and docetaxel
30 mg/m [2] intravenous (IV) on Days 4 and 11, and
capecitabine 750 mg/m [2] orally twice daily on Days 1
through 14. For LAPC, the most common induction
regimen was six 14-day cycles of FOLFIRINOX as
oxaliplatin 85 mg/m [2], folinic acid 400 mg/m [2], irinotecan 180 mg/m [2], fl uorouracil, 400 mg/m [2] IV bolus
Day 1, and fl uorouracil 1200 mg/m [2] /day IV continuous 46-hour infusion on Days 1 – 2. Gemcitabine
alone was most commonly given in three four-week
cycles at 1000 mg/m [2] IV on Days 1, 8 and 15. Several
patients received gemcitabine as above with the addition of nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m [2] IV.
Patients were identifi ed as receiving “ per protocol ” for purposes of this study if they received chemotherapy for at least the number of cycles listed
with less than one week of protocol interruption.
Dose reductions were allowed for toxicities.

_Radiation treatment and restaging_

Under EUS guidance, 2 – 4 fi ducial markers were
placed into the tumor [20]. A fl uoroscopic study was
then performed to gauge the amplitude of tumor
motion by tracking the markers during respiration
with an applied abdominal compression device. For
tumor motion  � 1 cm, radiation treatment utilized
respiratory gating by the Varian Real-Time Position
Management system (Varian Medical Systems Inc.,
Palo Alto, CA, USA). Patients were immobilized by
a BodyFix cradle (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden). Isocenter was then determined on non-contrast CT
simulation scan followed by repeat four-dimensional
CT with IV and oral contrast.
SBRT began at least seven days after last chemotherapy administration (median 20 days). Five consecutive daily fractions were delivered by Varian
Truebeam or Trilogy linear accelerator to gross tumor
volume (GTV) within the pancreas plus motion with
a 3 – 5mm planning tumor volume expansion. Intensity


-----

modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was utilized
to plan 28 – 30 Gy (median 30 Gy) to the planning
tumor volume with simultaneous dose painting to up
to 50 Gy (median 40 Gy) to areas of vessel involvement by tumor. Dose was limited by organs at risk as
follows: for each of duodenum, small bowel, and
stomach mean  � 20 Gy, volume receiving 30 Gy (V30)
� 2 cm [3], V35 Gy � 0.5 cm [3] ; each kidney mean  � 10
Gy, spinal cord maximum 20 Gy.
After completion of radiation treatment, patients
were restaged by repeat examination, pancreas protocol CT, PET/CT, and multidisclipinary tumor
board presentation. Patients were eligible for surgery
if there continued to be no imaging evidence of distant metastases, if they met criteria for resectable or
borderline resectability, and if they were judged to be
able to tolerate resection medically.

_Surgery and pathology_

Surgery was usually performed 1 – 2 months after
SBRT, and all patients except one underwent surgery
within three months after SBRT. Patients with tumors
of the pancreatic head underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. Tumors of the pancreatic body or tail
were removed by distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. Rare patients required total pancreatectomy
due to concerns of diffuse tumor infi ltration or
numerous intraductal mucinous papillary neoplasms.
A vascular surgeon was available when necessary for
repair or resection of the superior mesenteric vein
(SMV) or portal vein (PV).
Pathology was reported by pathologists with
expertise in gastrointestinal pathology. College of
American Pathology protocols were used for examination, including tumor response grade used for
response to neoadjuvant therapy [9]. Margin negative was defi ned as no tumor cells at the edge of the
specimen.

_Follow-up and analysis_

Patients were evaluated every 3 – 6 months for the
fi rst fi ve years and yearly thereafter. All charts were
reviewed to identify outcomes and potentially radiation-related toxicity. Acute side effects were defi ned
as those occurring within 90 days of radiation treatment. Side effects were graded according to version
4.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.
Statistical testing was performed with IBM SPSS
(IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0;
IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Overall survival
(OS), event free survival (EFS), and locoregional
control (LRC) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier
method and compared by the log-rank (Mantel-Cox)

test, with time starting at the date of diagnosing
biopsy. EFS was defi ned as freedom from disease
progression or death from any cause.

**Results**

A total of 159 patients, 110 BRPC and 49 LAPC,
have been treated with the induction chemotherapy
and SBRT protocol. Their characteristics are listed
in Table I. GTX chemotherapy was given to 89
(81%) BRPC patients, while FOLFIRINOX was
most common (21 patients, 43%) in the LAPC
group. Gemcitabine alone was prescribed to 17
(35%) LAPC patients, usually due to concerns
about the ability of individual patients to tolerate
the FOLFIRINOX regimen. Of the 110 BRPC
patients, 56 (51%) underwent curative intent resection, while 46 (42%) patients became unresectable
during neoadjuvant therapy due to local or distant
progression. Another eight (7%) patients suffered
decline in performance status that precluded resection. Of the 49 LAPC patients, seven (14%) underwent surgical exploration based on performance
status and imaging response suggestive of resectability, though two were found to be unresectable
at exploration.
Five (10%) LAPC patients underwent R0 resection. It was observed that all fi ve LAPC patients
undergoing complete resection received FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy per protocol (at least six,
two-week cycles received within 84 days). The fi ve
patients represent 24% of the 21 FOLFIRINOX
recipients and 36% of the 14 per protocol FOLFIRINOX recipients. Table II demonstrates that
when compared to other chemotherapy protocols,
receipt of FOLFIRINOX was statistically signifi cant
for resection in these LAPC patients (p  � 0.011).
Surgical and pathologic outcomes are displayed
in Table III. Vascular repair was required in 22 (36%)
patients, though positive margins were only obtained
in two (3%) patients. Despite clear evidence of disease regression on imaging, LAPC patients who successfully underwent resection were found to either
have moderate response (60%) or poor response
(40%) by tumor response grade. There were four
(7%) patients observed to have pathologic complete
response (pCR). None of these patients have yet
relapsed (EFS log-rank p  � 0.066 for pCR vs. any
other response).
Median follow-up was 14.0 months (range 4 – 46
months) with median OS and EFS estimated at 18.1
months and 12.7 months, respectively. Figure 1
shows OS and EFS for BRPC and LAPC. Median
OS and EFS were 19.2 months and 11.9 months in
the BRPC group and 15.0 months and 13.2 months
in the LAPC group (comparisons not signifi cant).

23.1 months for the curative intent surgery group
compared to median OS and EFS of 14.0 months
and 9.5 months for patients not undergoing curative
intent surgery. Median follow-up for patients undergoing surgery who have not died was 20.3 months
(range 6 – 46 months). The two patients with R1
resections remain without evidence of disease at 6.8

was reported in 83 (52%) patients. Fatigue was
most common (31%). Epigastric pain was reported
by 23 (14%) patients, though opiates were required
by only 12 (8%) patients. All toxicities are listed
in Supplementary Table I (available online at

**Discussion**

In the present study, we demonstrate outcomes of all
159 patients at our institution who received neoadju

vant chemotherapy and SBRT for the treatment of
BRPC and LAPC pancreatic adenocarcinoma with
median follow-up of 14 months. This represents the
largest series of SBRT in pancreatic cancer to date. Of
the 110 BRPC patients, 56 (51%) underwent curativeintent resection, with 96% R0 resection rate. Patients
undergoing resection lived signifi cantly longer than
patients not undergoing resection. Out of 49 LAPC
patients, fi ve responded suffi ciently on imaging to
undergo negative margin resection after neoadjuvant
treatment. These patients all received the FOLFIRINOX regimen, with superior resection rate compared to gemcitabine-based regimens. Patients who did
not undergo resection had a 78% LRC rate at one year.
Grade  � 3 toxicity potentially attributable to radiation
therapy was observed in only 11 (7%) of patients.

The data presented here compares similarly in
some respects to our earlier series of 73 patients
receiving induction chemotherapy and SBRT with
10.5 months of median follow-up, though there are
several signifi cant advancements [7]. The median
radiation doses to tumor and tumor-vessel abutment
escalated from 25 Gy and 35 Gy, to 30 Gy and
40 Gy, respectively, with minimal change in signifi cant toxicity rate. The prior series identifi ed no LAPC
patients undergoing resection after neoadjuvant treatment. Since that publication, the number of LAPC
patients tripled, with a higher proportion receiving
FOLFIRINOX. The median follow-up time is longer
in this study, and particularly the maximum follow-up
time in this study is nearly doubled to 46 months.
This particularly impacts median OS estimates for
the longest lived patients. Previously, the median OS
in the surgically resected group was estimated at 19.2
months, however, very few patients had follow-up to
that time, making the estimate inaccurate. Median
OS for the surgically resected patients is now estimated to be 34.2 months, which still has the potential
to be underestimated due to follow-up time.
This study is comparable in size and outcomes to
the 2008 report of BRPC by Katz et  al. which
included 125 patients who completed neoadjuvant
conventional chemoradiotherapy for BRPC, albeit
with a different defi nition for borderline resectability
than that used here [21]. In their study, 66 (53%)
patients underwent curative intent resection after
neoadjuvant treatment, with 94% R0 resection rate
and 6% pathologic complete response. Further, the
median OS in their series was 40 months for resected
patients, 13 months for patients not undergoing
resection, and 18 months for all patients. This is
similar to the results of the current study as follows:


34.2 months for resected patients, 11.3 months for
BRPC and LAPC patients not undergoing resection,
and 19.2 months for all BRPC patients.
Complete surgical resections of LAPC after neoadjuvant therapy with single agent chemotherapy
and radiation have been reported in only 1 – 5% of
LAPC patients in large series [22,23]. However, several recent publications have reported more frequent
downstaging of LAPC with FOLFIRINOX. Hosein
et al. recently published their series of 18 LAPC
patients receiving FOLFIRINOX [16]. At maximum
response or tolerability, fi ve underwent R0 resection.
Of the remainder, three patients later underwent R0
resection after further chemoradiotherapy for an
impressive 44% overall resection rate. Faris et  al. also
reported their initial experience of FOLFIRINOX
followed by conventional chemoradiotherapy in 22
LAPC patients and resection rate of 23% was
achieved. Here we demonstrate fi ve (24%) patients
resected after FOLFIRINOX and SBRT compared
with no resected LAPC patients of 28 treated
with gemcitabine-based regimens and SBRT. To our
knowledge, this work is the fi rst to suggest superiority of FOLFIRINOX compared to other chemotherapy regimens in converting LAPC to resectability.
Given the trend towards improved survival for surgically resected LAPC patients, prospective study
is warranted to evaluate the superiority of FOLFIRINOX compared to gemcitabine-based regimens
in the neoadjuvant setting.

**Conclusions**

The induction chemotherapy and SBRT protocol was
applied to the largest series to date (n  � 159) of BRPC
and LAPC patients with 51% resection rate for BRPC

patients and 24% resection rate for LAPC patients
who received FOLFIRINOX. The size and follow-up
rivals the largest single institution series of BRPC
patients receiving conventional neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. While patient numbers are limited in the
current study, FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy was
associated with a higher resection rate in LAPC than
gemcitabine-based regimens. At 14.0 months of
median follow-up, signifi cant OS benefi t was identifi ed for patients undergoing surgery, and trend for OS
was identifi ed for the subgroup of LAPC patients
undergoing surgery. One year LRC was 78% in those
patients not undergoing surgery. Grade  � 3 potentially radiation-related toxicity rate was only 7%. This
data underscores the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of SBRT-based regimens for BRPC and LAPC.
