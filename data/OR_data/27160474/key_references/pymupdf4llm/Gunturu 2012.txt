Abstract Although FOLFIRINOX significantly increases
survival in metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC) compared to
gemcitabine (Conroy et al. N Engl J Med 364:1817–1825,
2011), toxicities have tempered enthusiasm for its use in full
doses. To assess the impact of dose attenuations on toxicity
and efficacy, we reviewed our institution’s experience with
FOLFIRINOX in locally advanced pancreatic cancer
(LAPC) and MPC. We performed a retrospective review of
dose, toxicity, and efficacy of FOLFIRINOX in all patients
with LAPC and MPC treated between June 2010 and July
2011 at Yale. Toxicities in all patients and response rate (RR)
and survival in previously untreated MPC were compared to
data reported by Conroy. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival were estimated by Kaplan–Meier
method. Thirty-five patients were treated (16 LAPC; 19
MPC). Twenty-nine patients received dose attenuations with
the first cycle. Median relative doses of irinotecan and bolus
fluorouracil were less than those reported by Conroy (64 vs.
81 % and 66 vs. 82 %, respectively). RR was 50 % in LAPC
and 47 % in MPC, and the latter did not differ significantly
from the RR reported by Conroy (p = 0.19). OS at 6 and
12 months in MPC was comparable to OS reported by
Conroy. Grade 3/4 toxicities were less than reported by
Conroy, including fatigue (p = 0.009) and neutropenia
(p \ 0.0001). Nine patients experienced transient dysarthria
during irinotecan administration. Our findings validate

Introduction

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancerrelated death in men and women [1]. There were an estimated 43,920 new cases and 37,390 deaths from pancreatic
cancer in the United States in 2012, and the 5-year survival
for all patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma is \5 %

[2]. The vast majority of patients (80–90 %) present with
incurable metastatic or locally advanced unresectable disease. Gemcitabine has been the standard of care for treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer for over a decade
based on a randomized trial showing an improvement in
the one-year survival with gemcitabine compared to fluorouracil (FU) (18 vs. 2 %, p = 0.0001) [3]. Although well
tolerated, the efficacy of gemcitabine is marginal, with
reported response rates of less than 10 % and median
survivals of less than 7 months in patients with metastatic
disease. Despite promising phase II trials with gemcitabine-based combinations in advanced pancreatic cancer,
the addition of cytotoxic drugs (e.g., FU, capecitabine,
oxaliplatin, cisplatin, irinotecan) or targeted agents (bevacizumab, cetuixmab, erlotinib) to gemcitabine has yielded
no meaningful gains in overall survival in multiple randomized trials comparing gemcitabine doublets to gemcitabine alone, till recently [4–13].

Conroy et al. [14] first reported impressive efficacy and
acceptable tolerability of the combination regimen FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m[2] over 2 h, followed by irinotecan
180 mg/m[2] over 90 min and leucovorin 400 mg/m[2] over 2 h,
followed by FU 400 mg/m[2] bolus and 2,400 mg/m[2] 46 h
continuous infusion) in a phase II study in 46 patients with
unresectable pancreatic cancer (11 locally advanced, 35
metastatic). In this preliminary study, there were no toxic
deaths, and the confirmed response rate was 26 %, including
4 % complete response rate, and median overall survival was
10.2 months. Subsequently, FOLFIRINOX was compared to
gemcitabine in a randomized phase III trial in patients with
metastatic pancreatic cancer [15]. This study showed significant improvements in overall survival (11.1 vs. 6.8 mo),
progression-free survival (6.4 vs. 3.3 mo) and response rate
(31.6 vs. 9.4 %) with FOLFIRINOX compared to gemcitabine. However, FOLFIRINOX was associated with significantly more grade 3 and 4 toxicity than gemcitabine (diarrhea,
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and sensory neuropathy). Based on this study, FOLFIRINOX is
considered the most effective regimen for metastatic pancreatic cancer, and it is emerging as the new standard of care in
appropriate patients with a good performance status. However, given its toxicities, there has been a reluctance to use
FOLFIRINOX in full doses, despite the significant increase in
efficacy of this regimen compared to gemcitabine.
It is unknown whether the administration of attenuated
doses of FOLFIRINOX compromises its efficacy. Moreover, there is a paucity of data regarding the efficacy of
FOLFIRINOX in patients with non-metastatic locally
advanced pancreatic cancer. We conducted a retrospective
review of patients with metastatic or locally advanced
unresectable pancreatic cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX
at Yale’s Smilow Cancer Center to assess the efficacy and
the toxicities of this regimen as it is used in an academic
practice with routine dose attenuations.

Methods

Design

We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with
locally advanced unresectable and metastatic pancreatic
cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX at Yale’s Smilow Cancer
Center between June 2010 and July 2011. We evaluated
patient characteristics, toxicities, response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) based
on review of the patients’ medical records and imaging
studies. Toxicities in the entire Yale cohort (locally advanced
and metastatic patients), and patient characteristics and RR in
the metastatic cohort, were compared to the FOLFIRINOXtreated group as reported by Conroy et al. [15].

## 1 3


Treatment

Full dose FOLFIRINOX consisted of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m[2]

over 2 h, followed by irinotecan (IRI) 180 mg/m[2] over
90 minandleucovorin(LV)400 mg/m[2] over2 h,followedby
FU 400 mg/m[2] as a bolus and 2,400 mg/m[2] as a 46 h continuousinfusion.Dosemodificationsweremadeatthetreating
physician’s discretion. All patients received peg-filgrastim
with the first cycle and subsequent cycles in the absence of
severe leukocytosis. Patients routinely received palonosetron,
aprepitant, and dexamethasone for emesis prophylaxis.

Assessment

Patients were evaluated for toxicities at the start of each
cycle with history, examination, performance status, complete blood count, and metabolic panel. Response assessment imaging was obtained after every 4–6 cycles of
treatment. All scans were systematically reviewed by the
investigators (KSG, JRT) for response by RECIST.

Duration of treatment and follow-up

Treatment was discontinued at the discretion of the treating
physician for unacceptable toxicity, progression of disease,
or pursuit of alternative therapies, including surgical
resection or radiotherapy for locally advanced disease.
Patients were followed for PFS and OS.

Statistics

Toxicities in the entire Yale group were compared with the
toxicities in the FOLFIRINOX-treated group as reported by
Conroy et al. [15]. One-sample proportion test was used to
compare the proportion of grade 3 and 4 adverse events
(AEs). Patient characteristics and RR of the Yale metastatic
cohort were compared with the FOLFIRINOX-treated group
as reported by Conroy et al. [15]. One-sample Wilcoxon
signed rank test or Fisher’s exact test was used to compare
patient characteristics. One-sample proportion test was used
to compare the RR in previously untreated metastatic
patients. OS and PFS analyses were performed using Kaplan–Meier method. Two patients in the metastatic cohort
who had received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease
were excluded from RR and survival analysis.

Results

Patient characteristics

21Between June 2010 and July 2011, 35 patients with
advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma were treated with


-----

FOLFIRINOX at the Yale Smilow Cancer Center, including
16 with locally advanced unresectable disease and 19 with
metastatic disease. The demographics and disease characteristicsareshowninTable 1.Comparedtotheseriesreportedby
Conroy et al. [15] in previously untreated patients with metastatic disease who received FOLFIRINOX, more patients
with metastatic disease in our cohort were female (p = 0.006)
and had ECOG PS of 0 (p = 0.003). In our 19 patients with
metastatic disease, 2 had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy, 1 had received prior neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy,
and 2 had received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

Dose modifications and supportive care

Dose modifications were at the discretion of the treating
physician. Only 6 of 35 patients received full doses of each
drug of FOLFIRINOX with the first cycle. In the remaining
29 patients, dose attenuations with the first cycle were as
follows: IRI was reduced in 27 and omitted in 1, OX was
reduced in 10, bolus FU was reduced in 9 and omitted in 7,
LV was decreased in 11, infusional FU was reduced in 3.
The median number of cycles received was 11 (range
1–28). The median relative doses of each drug (in comparison with the median relative doses in FOLFIRINOXtreated patients reported by Conroy et al. [15]) were as
follows: OX 90 % (vs. 78 %), IRI 64 % (vs. 81 %), bolus
FU 66 % (vs. 82 %), and infusional FU 100 % (vs. 82 %).
34 of 35 patients received peg-filgrastim with the first cycle
and subsequent cycles, except in the event of severe leukocytosis, at the discretion of the treating physician.

Efficacy

Response

Response rates in patients with locally advanced and
metastatic disease are shown in Table 2. Two of 19 patients
with metastatic disease were excluded from the analysis, as
they had received prior chemotherapy for metastatic


disease. The RR (CR ? PR) in the entire group (locally
advanced and metastatic) was 48 %, with 1 CR and 15 PR
in 33 patients. In patients with metastatic disease, the RR
was 47 % and did not differ significantly from the RR of
32 % reported by Conroy et al. in FOLFIRINOX-treated
patients (p = 0.19). In patients with locally advanced disease, the RR was 50 %, and two patients were able to
undergo resection after 4 and 6 cycles. One of these
patients had a near pathologic complete response with
2 mm of residual tumor.

Progression-free and overall survival

The survival data are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 1. For the
entire cohort of patients (locally advanced and metastatic),
the median PFS was 16.1 months, and the median OS has
not been reached.
In patients with metastatic disease, the median PFS and
OS were 9.9 and 11.2 months, respectively. The PFS in the
metastatic cohort at 6 and 12 months was 76 and 35 %,
respectively, and the OS at 6 and 12 months was 82 and
50 %, respectively. By comparison, the OS at 6 and
12 months was 75.9 and 48.4 %, respectively, in the
FOLFIRINOX-treated patients as reported by Conroy et al.

[15].
In patients with locally advanced disease, the median
PFS and OS have not been reached. The PFS for locally
advanced disease at 6 and 12 months was 94 and 77 %,
respectively, and the OS at 6 and 12 months was 94 and
83 %, respectively.

Adverse events

Treatment-related grade 3 and 4 toxicities are summarized
in Table 4. There were no toxic deaths attributable to
FOLFIRINOX. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 fatigue (5.7
vs. 23.6 %, p = 0.009) and neutropenia (11.4 vs. 45.7 %,
p \ 0.0001) was significantly decreased in our cohort
compared to the FOLFIRINOX-treated patients as reported

by Conroy et al. [15]. There was a non-significant trend
toward a lower incidence of febrile neutropenia, anemia,
thrombocytopenia, vomiting, diarrhea, and neuropathy
compared to the FOLFIRINOX-treated patients as reported
by Conroy et al. [15]. Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea in our patient
population was just 2.9 % compared to 12.7 % in the
FOLFIRINOX-treated patients as reported by Conroy et al.

[15].
In our study, there were nine cases of acute onset of
dysarthria and other neurological symptoms during the
FOLFIRINOX infusion. These symptoms included dysarthric speech, facial or perioral paresthesias, leg cramps,
ataxia, and blepharospasm. In all cases, the onset of these
neurological symptoms was temporally associated with the
irinotecan infusion. The symptoms remitted with interruption of the irinotecan infusion, and in some cases,
recurred with re-challenge. In all cases, the symptoms
resolved completely without specific intervention other
than transient interruption of the irinotcan infusion and/or

## 1 3


administration of anticholinergic agents (atropine and/or
diphenhydramine). The first two patients in whom these
symptoms developed were hospitalized for neurological
work up to rule out a cerebral vascular event; subsequent
patients were managed as out-patients in the infusion
center. Dose reduction of irinotecan and/or pre-medication
with anticholinergics, at the discretion of the treating
physician, prevented or mitigated the severity of these
neurologic symptoms in subsequent cycles in all patients.

Discussion

Our single institution retrospective study validates the
efficacy of FOLFIRINOX in unselected patients with
locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer. The
majority of the patients treated at our institution received
attenuated doses of FOLFIRINOX with the first and subsequent cycles of treatment, and the median relative doses

of IRI and bolus FU were lower than those reported in the
FOLFIRINOX-treated group reported by Conroy et al.

[15]. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that the efficacy of
FOLFIRINOX was not compromised by these dose modifications. The RR of 47 % in our patients with metastatic
disease was not significantly different from the RR of 32 %
in the FOLFIRINOX-treated patients as reported by Conroy et al. [15]. Moreover, the observed PFS and OS at 6 and
12 months, as well as the median OS and PFS, in our
patients with metastatic disease were also comparable to
the survivals reported by Conroy et al. [15] in the FOLFIRINOX-treated patients.
Although FOLFIRINOX is associated with a significant
increase in response rate and overall survival in metastatic
pancreatic cancer compared to gemcitabine, the toxicities of
FOLFIRINOX have tempered enthusiasm for its use in full
doses in community and academic centers [15]. Our study
suggests that incorporation of modest dose attenuations of
IRI and bolus FU in the majority of patients, in conjunction
with routine use of growth factor support with the first and
subsequent cycles, is associated with less toxicity than
observed in the FOLFIRINOX-treated patients reported by
Conroy et al. [15]. We observed a significant decrease in the
incidence of grade 3 or 4 fatigue and neutropenia, and a trend
toward decreased incidence of febrile neutropenia, anemia,
thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, vomiting, and neuropathy in
our cohort compared to the FOLFIRINOX-treated patients
reported by Conroy et al. [15]. The improved tolerability of
FOLFIRINOX in our institution’s cohort of patients may be
related to the dose modifications, routine use of growth factor
support, or the use of aggressive anti-emetic and anti-diarrheal regimens. In addition, a higher percentage of our
patients had an ECOG PS of 0 compared to the FOLFIRINOX-treated patients reported by Conroy et al. [15]. Interestingly, 57 % of our patients had carcinoma of the head of
the pancreas, compared to 39 % of patients reported by
Conroy et al. Although 31 % of our patients had biliary stents
for obstruction, we observed only one case of cholangitis.


The optimum treatment of locally advanced unresectable
pancreatic cancer remains uncertain. Current therapeutic
options include chemoradiation or chemotherapy alone.
Meta-analyses comparing chemotherapy with chemoradiation showed no survival benefit and increased toxicity for
chemoradiotherapy compared to chemotherapy [16–18]. The
combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin was compared
with gemcitabine alone in locally advanced or metastatic
pancreatic cancer in the GERGOR/GISCAD randomized
trial.Despite anincreasedRRinlocallyadvanceddisease with
gemcitabine/oxaliplatin compared to gemcitabine (27 vs.
14 %), the overall survival was identical at 10.3 mo in both
arms [7]. In a subsequent randomized ECOG trial comparing
conventionalgemcitabine, gemcitabine fixed-doserate(FDR)
infusion, and gemcitabine/oxaliplatin in advanced pancreatic
cancer,therewasnodifferenceinRR,PFS,orOSbetweenany
of the regimens, and the median survival was just 9.2 months
in locally advanced disease [8].
Although FOLFIRINOX has superior efficacy compared
to gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, there are limited data regarding its efficacy and tolerability in locally advanced pancreatic cancer. In the initial
phase II trial of FOLFIRINOX, only 11 patients had locally
advanced disease, and in these patients, the RR was 27 %
and median OS was 15.7 mos [14]. In our cohort of 16
patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer treated
with FOLFIRINOX, we observed a response rate of 50 %
and a disease control rate of 94 %, confirming impressive
efficacy of FOLFIRINOX in locally advanced disease. The
RR in our cohort of locally advanced pancreatic cancer is
higher than that reported for gemcitabine-based regimens
and is similar to the RR reported by Conroy et al. [15] in
FOLFIRINOX-treated patients with metastatic disease.
The PFS for locally advanced disease at 6 and 12 months
was 94 and 77 %, respectively, and the OS at 6 and
12 month was 94 and 83 %, respectively. Two of our 16
patients with locally advanced disease were able to
undergo resection, and one patient had near complete

pathological response. Our findings suggest that the efficacy and tolerability of FOLFIRINOX in locally advanced
pancreatic cancer is similar to its efficacy in the metastatic
setting and support the use of FOLFIRINOX as initial
therapy in patients with locally advanced or borderline
disease.
We report nine cases of acute onset of dysarthria and other
neurological symptoms (facial or perioral paresthesias, leg
cramps, ataxia,and blepharospasm)duringthe FOLFIRINOX
infusion. The onset of these symptoms was temporally associated with the irinotecan infusion. In all cases, the symptoms
resolved completely without specific intervention other than
transient interruption of the irinotecan infusion and/or
administration of anticholinergic agents (atropine or diphenhydramine). In some cases, the symptoms recurred with reinitiation of the irinotecan infusion, but resolved with
administrationofanticholinergicagents.Neurotoxiceffectsof
irinotecan are uncommon, and only four cases have been
reported in the literature [19–22]. The mechanism by which
CNS toxicity occurs after irinotecan infusion is not well
understood. Harel et al. [23] proposed that irinotecan causes
increased cholinergic activity by binding to the active site of
acetylcholinesterase causing its functional inhibition. Cholinergic receptors are found more in the brainstem nuclei and
using cholinergic agents result in a surge of hypoglossal nerve
activity [24, 25], which might explain the dysarthria associatedwith irinotecantoxicity.This mechanism could berelated
to cholinergic oversensitivity of the neurons in the hypoglossal nerve nucleus. Atropine has not been shown to prevent
dysarthria, and all the reported cases showed that these
symptoms were reversible and severity did not worsen upon
re-challenging with irinotecan [26]. Since oxaliplatin is routinely administered prior to irinotecan in the FOLFIRINOX
regimen, we speculate that oxaliplatin may enhance the neurotoxic effects of irinotecan, thereby increasing the incidence
of this rare side effect of irinotecan.

Conclusions

In this single institution retrospective study, the routine use
of modest dose attenuations of FOLFIRINOX, in conjunction with growth factor support, was associated with
improved tolerability compared to full dose FOLFIRINOX
as reported by Conroy et al. Our findings suggest that these
modest dose attenuations do not reduce the efficacy of
FOLFIRINOX in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.
Moreover, the efficacy of FOLFIRINOX in locally
advanced disease was comparable to its efficacy in metastatic disease. Given the number of patients in our series
and the limitations of a retrospective study, our findings
require further substantiation. Prospective trials are needed
to validate the efficacy and tolerability of modifications of

FOLFIRINOX in metastatic pancreatic cancer. In patients
with locally advanced and borderline disease, we need to
better define the activity of FOLFIRINOX and its role and
safety in the neoadjuvant setting.
