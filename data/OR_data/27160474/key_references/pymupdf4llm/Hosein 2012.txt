Background
Pancreatic cancer carries a dismal prognosis with a 5year overall survival rate of 6 %. It is the fourth leading
cause of cancer death in the USA with an estimated
37,660 deaths in 2011 [1]. Surgery remains the best
chance for cure but only 10-20 % of patients will be candidates for curative resection at diagnosis. Up to 40 % of

newly diagnosed patients will present with locally
advanced, unresectable disease because of vascular encasement, and consensus criteria now exist to clearly define this group [2]. Up to one-third of patients who
initially have locally advanced, unresectable disease may
become resectable after neoadjuvant therapy [3]. These
patients can have comparable survival to those who were
initially resectable.
Systemic chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer has generally been disappointing. The traditional
gemcitabine-based therapies result in low response rates

and short survival times in the range of 6 months. Interest in systemic chemotherapy for this disease was recently rejuvenated with the advent of the FOLFIRINOX
combination (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and
oxaliplatin) [4]. In the randomized phase III ACCORD11 trial, FOLFIRINOX was shown to be superior to
single-agent gemcitabine in response rate (RR), progressionfree survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The RR in
the FOLFIRINOX arm was 32 % versus 9 % in the gemcitabine arm, and this translated into an improvement in
PFS to 6.4 months (versus 3.3 in the control arm, p
< 0.0001) and OS of 11.1 months (versus 6.8 months in
the control arm, p < 0.0001). This trial only enrolled
patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. In the setting
of LAPC, a good tumor response is a desirable goal since
tumor shrinkage away from vascular structures may lead
to resectability.
Radiation therapy may be beneficial in patients with
LAPC and combined chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) has
been tested in this population. Although 5-FU-based
CCRT is commonly used in this setting, gemcitabine-based
CCRT is safe and effective [5,6]. The best sequence of
treatment administration has not been established.
Prospective randomized trials are ongoing to evaluate
whether there is a survival benefit of CCRT versus
chemotherapy alone. Retrospective data suggest superiority of sequencing chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation [7]. The theoretical advantages of this approach
include eradicating micrometastatic disease early on, and
also identifying patients who progress early and develop
metastases during initial chemotherapy (an estimated
25-30 % of patients), thus avoiding morbidities associated with radiotherapy in this group of patients.
Our group at the University of Miami adopted the approach of induction chemotherapy followed by CCRT in
patients with unresectable or borderline resectable
LAPC. Although the phase III results supporting the use
of FOLFIRINOX in pancreatic cancer were only recently
presented in 2010, the initial FOLFIRINOX randomized
phase II trial (reported in 2007) showed a similarly high
RR [8]. After these promising results were presented, we
began using this regimen in patients with borderline resectable (BR) or unresectable (UR) LAPC. The aim of
this retrospective study was to define the efficacy and
toxicities of this regimen in LAPC, especially in patients
with pancreatic head tumors and biliary obstruction – a
group that was relatively underrepresented in the ACCORD-11 trial.

Patients and Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis at the University
of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and
Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida of all
patients with LAPC who received first-line treatment


with FOLFIRINOX. Patients were identified by searching
the pancreatic cancer database which was approved by
the University of Miami Institutional Review Board
(IRB). This IRB-approved database provided a waiver of
the requirement for informed consent for retrospective
studies and allowed for publication of de-identified data.
The medical, radiation and surgical oncologists in the
group developed an algorithm for uniform treatment of
this group of patients as follows. Patients were selected
for treatment with FOLFIRINOX if they had a histological or cytological diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Group performance
status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, adequate organ function,
and UR/BR LAPC. For patients who presented with biliary obstruction, adequate biliary drainage was required
prior to initiation of this chemotherapy. The determination of resectability was made by multidisciplinary review. Since there is currently no internationally agreedupon definition of borderline-resectable LAPC, we applied the American Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association/Society of Surgical Oncology/Society for Surgery
of the Alimentary Tract (AHPBA/SSO/SSAT) criteria

[2]. These criteria are summarized in Table 1. The data
used to determine resectability included pretreatment
contrast-enhanced CT scans (CECT's) and endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) in all patients and surgical exploration
when available.

Treatment with FOLFIRINOX proceeded with doses
identical to the ACCORD-11 trial [4]. On day 1 of every
14-day cycle, oxaliplatin was administered at a dose of
85 mg per square meter, irinotecan at 180 mg per square
meter, folinic acid at 400 mg per square meter, and 5fluoruracil (5-FU) as a bolus of 400 mg per square
meter. 5-FU was then administered as a continuous infusion of 2400 mg per square meter over 46 hours. Filgrastim was at the discretion of the treating physician.
Treatment continued until progression of disease, intolerable toxicity or maximum response. Toxicities were
assessed at every fortnightly visit and graded according
to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4 [9]. Criteria for
dose modification were similar to those described in the
ACCORD-11 trial. Response assessment by CECT's were
performed every 8 weeks on therapy or sooner if progression was suspected by symptoms or rising CA19-9.
After every CECT scan during treatment, each
patient’s case was reviewed at a multidisciplinary conference to determine whether the reason for defining the
patient as UR or BR had improved. Since size was not
the only criteria used in this evaluation, traditional response criteria (such as RECIST) were not employed.
For example, if a tumor was categorized as BR due to
abutment of the SMA up to 180°, the extent of abutment
was re-evaluated after every scan to determine if this
was improving and if the patient would now be a surgical candidate. If two consecutive scans during treatment
showed similar findings with no improvement, this was
considered to be the maximum response. Maximum tolerability was defined as the point when excessive toxicities warranted stopping FOLFIRINOX, even if a patient
had not achieved their maximum response. Because we
used an algorithm of real-time monitoring of response
and toxicity, there was no predefined minimum or maximum number of cycles.
At maximum response or tolerability, patients who
appeared to be resectable by imaging criteria were offered
surgical exploration and resection (within 6-8 weeks after
chemotherapy) followed by postoperative CCRT. Patients
who remained unresectable at maximum response or tolerability of FOLFIRINOX were offered CCRT. For radiation sensitization, patients received concurrent
gemcitabine at 600 mg per square meter per week. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was delivered in
a standard fashion to a total dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. At the end of CCRT, patients were re-evaluated
with CECT's to determine resectability. Post-CCRT treatment was left to the discretion of the treating physicians.
The primary endpoint for this analysis was the R0 resection rate. An R0 resection was defined as at least
1 mm free margins. An R1 resection was defined as
tumor within 1 mm from the closest margin. Secondary


endpoints included safety, tolerability, overall survival
and progression-free survival. All patients who received
at least one cycle of FOLFIRINOX were included in the
analysis. PFS and OS were calculated as follows; PFS was
defined as the duration in months from the date of the
first cycle of FOLFIRINOX until the date of documented
progression, recurrence or death, whichever was sooner.
OS was defined as the duration in months from the date
of the first cycle of FOLFIRINOX until the date of death
from any cause. Patients known to be alive were censored
at the time of last contact. PFS and OS were estimated by
the Kaplan–Meier method with corresponding two-sided
95 % CI's for survival proportions based on Greenwood's

variance and the log-transform method [10]. Descriptive
statistics were also used to summarize data.

Results
Between 5/2008 and 5/2011 we administered FOLFIRINOX to 18 treatment-naive patients with UR/BR LAPC.
The baseline characteristics of these patients are summarized in Table 2. One patient was defined as unresectable at
the time of exploratory laparotomy and the remaining
patients fulfilled criteria for UR/BR disease based on
CECT and EUS findings. One patient who had splenic
vein encasement was potentially resectable according to
the AHPBA/SSO/SSAT criteria but underwent neoadjuvant therapy because the tumor was large and ill defined
and the multidisciplinary group felt that the patient would
benefit from neoadjuvant therapy. Among the 11 patients
who had tumors at the head of the pancreas, 9 had metallic stents placed to relieve biliary obstruction and the
other 2 had double-bypass operations which included a
choledochojejunostomy. All patients who had stents or
bypass procedures achieved normalization of their serum
bilirubin levels prior to the start of chemotherapy.


Figure 1 shows the patient flow through the treatment
algorithm. After FOLFIRINOX therapy, 7 patients had
disease that was radiologically assessed as being potentially resectable. Five of these went on to have R0 resections, one R1 and one was grossly unresectable at
exploration. Among the remaining 11 patients, one
developed progression after 3 cycles and 10 went on to
receive CCRT. Among these 10 patients, 2 were ongoing
on CCRT at the time of this report; 5 remained with
unresectable disease; and 3 were radiologically assessed
as being potentially resectable after CCRT and all 3 went
on to have R0 resections. The overall R0 resection rate
was 8 out of 18 or 44 % (95 % CI 22-69 %) using this sequential combined modality approach. Among the 8
patients with successful R0 resections, the median number of FOLFIRINOX cycles delivered was 6 (range 5-17).
In these patients, the reasons for UR/BR at baseline were
SMV encasement in 2 patients, SMV/portal vein confluence encasement (2 patients), SMA encasement >180
degrees (1 patient), hepatic artery encasement (2
patients) and splenic vein encasement (1 patient).
With a median follow-up of 13.4 months, 2 patients
have died and 2 others are alive with progression of

disease. One of the patients who died had an R0 resection
and progressed 11 months after surgery. The KaplanMeier estimated median PFS and OS have not been
reached. The 1-year PFS was 83 % (95 % CI 59-96 %) and
the 1-year OS was 100 % (95 % CI 85-100 %). The estimated 1-year PFS was not significantly different for the
patients who achieved R0 resections (88 %; 95 % CI 47100 %) versus those who did not (80 %; 95 % CI 44-94 %,
p = 0.27). Figure 2 shows the Kaplan-Meier plots for PFS
and OS, including a stratification by resection status.
A total of 146 cycles of FOLFIRINOX were delivered
among the 18 patients treated, with a median of 8 cycles
per patient. Twenty-five cycles (17 %) were given at a
reduced dose, with 7 of these (5 %) being given without
irinotecan in one patient. Table 3 summarizes the treatment delivery. All patients experienced at least one


grade 1 or 2 adverse event and 8 patients (44 %) experienced at least one grade 3 or 4 adverse event. The adverse event profile is shown in Table 4. There were no
significant differences in the toxicity profile for patients
who had biliary stents versus those who did not. Filgrastim was used in 89 % of patients, and was started
prophylactically from cycle 1 in 50 %; in spite of this,
22 % of patients had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and 17 %
had neutropenic fever. No patient had to be taken off
FOLFIRINOX for toxicity. Ten patients (56 %) had a
treatment delay of at least one week due to toxicity
(most commonly for neutropenia or neutropenic fever).
There were no episodes of cholangitis during FOLFIRINOX in any of the 18 patients treated.
Among the 10 patients who went to surgery after
FOLFIRINOX, 3 experienced significant postoperative

complications. One patient developed C. Difficile colitis,
gastroparesis and a subhepatic collection; one had an
infected pancreatic bed collection requiring percutaneous drainage 3 times; and one had an infected splenic
bed collection requiring percutaneous drainage. None of
these patients received preoperative radiation. The median length of perioperative hospital stay for these 10
patients was 7 days (range 5 to 60).

Discussion
FOLFIRINOX can be considered a new standard of care
option in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with


a good performance status. In a survey of the prescribing
plans of American oncologists after the 2010 American
Society of Clinical Oncology meeting (during which the
ACCORD-11 phase III results were presented), 18 %
planned to offer FOLFIRINOX to good performance status patients, compared with 0 % in the same survey in
2009 [11]. However, FOLFIRINOX has not been readily
adopted by the oncology community in the US because
of concerns for the tolerability of this regimen and the
risk of cholangitis in patients with stents [12,13]. Some
of these concerns were quieted with the publication of
the full report of the ACCORD-11 trial, in which no
cholangitis was observed and the rate of febrile neutropenia was only 5.4 % [4].
The current study represents the first published series
of North American patients treated with FOLFIRINOX
with locally advanced pancreas cancer. The regimen’s
toxicity was for the most part reversible and manageable.
We selected relatively young patients with excellent performance status and little or no comorbidities. We believe that patient selection for FOLFIRINOX cannot be
overemphasized since we have anecdotally observed significantly poorer tolerability in older patients and those
with major comorbidities. Furthermore, we believe that
our practice of limiting the use of FOLFIRINOX to
patients who had adequate biliary drainage also helped
to lessen the toxicities since irinotecan depends on biliary elimination. Despite the use of prophylactic filgrastim in most patients, 3 (17 %) developed febrile
neutropenia, including 2 who had biliary stents in place.
The other common toxicities such as fatigue, nausea and
diarrhea were manageable, and no patient had to be

taken off chemotherapy due to intolerance. Although
the full dose of the regimen could be delivered in 85 %
of the administered cycles, treatment delays for toxicity
were common. In an attempt to attenuate the toxicities
of this regimen, the US cooperative groups are planning
FOLFIRINOX studies without the 5-FU bolus and with
mandatory prophylactic growth-factor support.
Our strategy of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX followed by
CCRT in patients with UR/BR LAPC resulted in an R0
resection rate of 44 %, with 2 patients in the denominator
still receiving CCRT. Although the follow-up is relatively
short, only 2 patients have died and 7 of the 8 patients
who underwent R0 resections remain progression-free at
a median follow-up of 14.9 months. For patients who
remained unresectable after FOLFIRINOX, CCRT was
able to convert 3 out of 10 (30 %) to resectability, and
may have provided some measure of disease control to
the others whose disease remained unresectable. Interestingly, a recently reported study of gemcitabine-based
CCRT (using the identical CCRT regimen used in our
series) reported resections in only 2 out of 28 (7 %)
patients [5]. Since our series is small and the event rate is
low, it is difficult to draw definite conclusions. Nonetheless, we hypothesize that the use of induction treatment
with FOLFIRINOX, followed by a non-cross resistant
chemotherapeutic agent as a radiation sensitizer (gemcitabine) might be an advantageous strategy to improve
response rates and resectability.

Conclusions
Neoadjuvant therapy with FOLFIRINOX in patients with
unresectable or borderline resectable locally advanced
pancreatic cancer appears to be feasible in selected
patients. Continued follow-up will determine if achieving
an R0 resection will translate into a survival advantage
in this group of patients. Further study of this sequential
combined modality approach is warranted.
