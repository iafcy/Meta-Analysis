ABSTRACT
Purpose. Limited data are available to guide neoadjuvant treatment of borderline resectable (BRPC) and locally
advanced (LAPC) pancreatic cancer.
Material and methods. We updated our institutional outcomes with a neoadjuvant chemotherapy and stereotactic
body radiotherapy (SBRT) approach. An IRB-approved analysis was performed of all BRPC and LAPC patients treated
with our departmental treatment protocol. After staging, medically fi t patients underwent chemotherapy for 2 – 3 months,
with regimen at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist. Patients then received SBRT delivered in fi ve con-
secutive daily fractions with median total radiation doses of 30 Gy to tumor and 40 Gy dose painted to tumor-vessel
interfaces. This was followed by restaging imaging for possible resection. Overall survival (OS), event free survival
(EFS), and locoregional control (LRC) rates were estimated and compared by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods.
Results. We identifi ed 159 patients, 110 BRPC and 49 LAPC, with 14.0 months median overall follow-up. The resec-
tion and margin negative (R0) rate for BRPC patients who completed neoadjuvant therapy was 51% and 96%, respec-
tively. Estimated median OS was 19.2 months for BRPC patients and 15.0 months for LAPC patients (p (cid:3) 0.402). Median
OS was 34.2 months for surgically resected patients versus 14.0 months for unresected patients (p (cid:4) 0.001). Five of 21
(24%) LAPC patients receiving FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy underwent R0 resection. In LAPC, FOLFIRINOX recip-
ients underwent R0 resection more often than other chemotherapy recipients (5 of 21 vs. 0 of 28, p (cid:3) 0.011). There was
a trend for improved survival in those resected LAPC patients (p (cid:3) 0.09). For those not undergoing resection, one year
LRC was 78%. Any grade (cid:5) 3 potentially radiation-related toxicity rate was 7%.
Conclusions. These data underscore the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of neoadjuvant SBRT and chemotherapy
for BRPC and LAPC.
