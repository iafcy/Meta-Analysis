Abstract
Purpose—On the basis of the ACCORD trial, FOLFIRINOX is effective in metastatic pancreatic
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), making it a rational choice for locally advanced PDAC (LA). Aims of
this study are to evaluate the accuracy of imaging in determining the resectability of PDAC and to
determine the surgical and clinicopathologic outcomes of pancreatic resections after neoadjuvant
FOLFIRINOX therapy.
Patients and Methods—Clinicopathologic data were retrospectively collected for surgical
PDAC patients receiving neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX or no neoadjuvant therapy between April
2011 and February 2014. Americas Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association/Society of Surgical
Oncology/Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract consensus guidelines defined LA and
borderline. Imaging was reviewed by a blinded senior pancreatic surgeon.
Results—Of 188 patients undergoing resection for PDAC, 40 LA/borderline received
FOLFIRINOX and 87 received no neoadjuvant therapy. FOLFIRINOX resulted in a significant
decrease in tumor size, yet 19 patients were still classified as LA and 9 as borderline. Despite post-
FOLFIRINOX imaging suggesting continued unresectability, 92% had an R0 resection. When
compared with no neoadjuvant therapy, FOLFIRINOX resulted in significantly longer operative
times (393 vs 300 minutes) and blood loss (600 vs 400 mL), but significantly lower operative

morbidity (36% vs 63%) and no postoperative pancreatic fistulas. Length of stay (6 vs 7 days),
readmissions (20% vs 30%), and mortality were equivalent (1% vs 0%). On final pathology, the
FOLFIRINOX group had a significant decrease in lymph node positivity (35% vs 79%) and
perineural invasion (72% vs 95%). Median follow-up was 11 months with a significant increase in
overall survival with FOLFIRINOX.
Conclusions—After neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX imaging no longer predicts unresectability.
Traditional pathologic predictors of survival are improved, and morbidity is decreased in
comparison to patients with clearly resectable cancers at the time of presentation.

The prevalence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) continues to increase. The American
Cancer Society predicts 46,420 new cases and 39,590 deaths in the United States in 2014.
The majority of patients present with metastatic disease, whereas 30% present with locally
advanced (LA) cancers.1 Unfortunately, overall survival (OS) of pancreatic cancer patients
remains low, with surgical resection offering the only chance for potential cure. However,
even then the OS is reported to be less than 20%.2–4 In the hopes of rendering LA PDAC
patients resectable, combination chemotherapy often followed by 50.4 Gy of radiation with
low-dose chemotherapy is administered.5,6
However, historically only 19% to 30% of patients are rendered resectable.7–10 If an R0
resection can be achieved, OS is similar to patients who are considered resectable at
presentation.9 Unfortunately, these heavily treated patients with LA PDAC have an
increased surgical morbidity and mortality.9,11
A significant breakthrough for patients with metastatic PDAC was achieved in 2011 with the
ACCORD trial.12 This trial demonstrated that the OS with fluorouracil, leucovorin,
oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRINOX) was improved when compared with gemcitabine
for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (6.8 vs 11.1 months, P < 0.001).12 On the
basis of these encouraging results, FOLFIRINOX became a rational choice to render
patients with LA PDAC resectable.13
Resectability of PDAC is determined by radiologic imaging. The most commonly used
imaging modality to stage PDAC is a triple-phase contrast-enhanced thin-slice
(multidetector row) helical computed tomography with 3-dimensional reconstructions.
Unfortunately, the definitions for LA and borderline lesions vary significantly. This
ambiguity prompted 4 guideline statements from the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the Americas Hepato-
Pancreato-Biliary Association (AHPBA)/Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO)/Society for
Surgery of the Alimentary Tract (SSAT).14–17 These guidelines address vascular
involvement, which is a major determinant of unresectability.

either LA or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer who received neoadjuvant
FOLFIRINOX were compared with resectable patients who underwent exploration without
neoadjuvant treatment. The first aim of this study is to critically evaluate the accuracy of
imaging in determining resectability after FOLFIRINOX with or without chemoradiation.
The second aim is to compare the surgical outcomes and clinicopathologic results of
pancreatic resections in this cohort of FOLFIRINOX-treated patients with patients who
received no neoadjuvant therapy.
Methods
With approval from the institutional review board, retrospective and prospectively collected
clinicopathologic data were collected for all patients who underwent resection for PDAC
between April 2011 and March 1, 2014, and for all patients who were surgically explored
after neoadjuvant treatment with FOLFIRINOX. Clinicopathologic factors evaluated
included age at operation, sex, race (grouped as white, Hispanic, and other), the Charlson
comorbidity index,18 body mass index (BMI) coded as underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal
(18.5–24.9 kg/m2), obese (25–35 kg/m2), and morbidly obese (>35 kg/m2) and previous
history of cancer. Baseline CA 19-9 level (U/mL), size and vascular involvement on
preoperative CT, estimated intraoperative blood loss, type of surgery (Whipple procedure,
distal or total pancreatectomy), hospital length of stay, postoperative complications
according to Clavien-Dindo classification,19 intraoperative radiation therapy, and
postoperative chemotherapy. Disease-free survival and OS were calculated from the date of
diagnosis. Date of death was obtained either from the medical records or from the Social
Security Death Index.
Histologic Characteristics
Pathologic data collected included tumor grade (classified as well, moderately, poorly
differentiated, and undifferentiated), tumor size, TNM classification, number of positive
nodes, resection margins, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and American Joint
Committee on Cancer stage.
A positive microscopic resection margin was defined as presence of tumor cells on any
surgical specimen margin as described by Staley et al.20 We recorded the pancreatic
transection, posterior retroperitoneal, uncinate, common bile duct, and enteric margins. A
gastrointestinal pathologist specialized in pancreatic cancer confirmed the histologic
diagnosis.
Radiologic Characteristics
Triple-phase contrast-enhanced thin-slice (multidetector row) helical CT with 3-dimensional
reconstruction and magnetic resonance images were reviewed. All patients were reviewed at
our gastrointestinal multidisciplinary meeting. This tumor board includes 2 or more
pancreatic surgeons, 1 or more gastrointestinal radiologist, 2 or more medical oncologists,
and 2 or more gastrointestinal radiation oncologists. LA and borderline lesions were defined
on the basis of the AHPBA/SSO/SSAT consensus guidelines.17 No patient had evidence of
metastases or distant nodal disease. Patients were considered LA if there was long segment

occlusion of the mesenteric vein/portal vein, more than 180-degree involvement of the
superior mesenteric artery (SMA) or involvement of the hepatic artery or celiac trunk.
Borderline resectable lesions included lesions with tumor abutment and short segment
occlusion of the mesenteric vein/portal vein, gastroduodenal artery encasement up to the
hepatic artery without extension to the celiac axis, or <180 degrees of tumor abutment of the
SMA.
A retrospective blinded review of the radiology before and after treatment with
FOLFIRINOX was performed by a senior pancreatic surgeon (A.L.W.).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software version 9.3 (Copyright 2010, SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Continuous data were expressed as median and range, whereas
categorical data were expressed as frequencies and percentages. Across neoadjuvant therapy
groups, the T test and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare normally and
nonnormally distributed continuous data, respectively, whereas the Fisher exact test was
used to compare categorical data. Comparisons over time within a neoadjuvant therapy
group were made with a paired T test for continuous data and the McNemar test for
categorical data. For OS, the Kaplan-Meier method was used. The difference in survival was
tested with log-rank test.
Results
Overall Cohort
A total of 188 patients underwent pancreatic resection for PDAC. Of these 188 patients, 40
received neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX with or without chemoradiation for LA or borderline
resectable PDAC, and 87 received no neoadjuvant therapy (Fig. 1). The patients who
received no neoadjuvant therapy were determined to have resectable cancers on preoperative
imaging and declined participation or did not qualify for other neoadjuvant protocols. These
2 groups are the basis of this report.
This study compares the best and worst “actors” by comparing patients with LA or
borderline cancers who received FOLFIRINOX with those patients who received no
neoadjuvant therapy because of the presence of what was believed to be a clearly resectable
lesion. The clinicopathologic factors of the study groups are listed in Table 1.
LA and borderline patients who received neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX were younger and had
a lower Charlson comorbidity score and better ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group) performance status when compared with the resectable patients who received no
neoadjuvant therapy. Patients receiving FOLFIRINOX also had a significantly lower BMI.
FOLFIRINOX Patients
A total of 47 patients underwent neoadjuvant treatment with FOLFIRINOX followed by
surgical exploration for attempted resection. The patients received a median of 8 complete
cycles (range 1–24), and only 3 patients (6.3%) developed severe treatment-related toxicity
resulting in disruption of therapy. Chemoradiation with 50.4 Gy and 5-FU (fluorouracil) was

administered to 24 patients who had no evidence of progressive disease after FOLFIRINOX
and before surgical exploration.
Patients receiving neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX had a decrease in pre- and posttreatment
median Ca19-9 from 169 to 16. This resulted in a Ca19-9 less than 40 U in 72% of patients
compared with only 31% of patients pretreatment. A significant decrease in tumor diameter
on CT from a median of 3.6 cm to 2.2 cm was also observed.
Of the 47 patients, 3 had metastatic disease and 4 were LA and unresectable. A
pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed in 34 patients and a distal pancreatectomy in 6
patients. Intraoperative radiation therapy administering a 7 to 12 Gy boost to the tumor bed
was performed in 12 patients who underwent resection of their PDAC.
Pre- and Post-FOLFIRINOX Staging
On the basis of the AHPBA/SSO/SSAT consensus guidelines, 25 patients were considered
LA and 15 were considered borderline at the time of diagnosis by the multidisciplinary
tumor board (see Table 2). Posttreatment review of the imaging by the tumor board
identified a complete response in 6 patients, a partial response in 30 patients, and stable
disease in 4 patients. No progression of disease was identified.
To obtain an objective assessment of preoperative tumor staging, all pre- and post-
FOLFIRINOX imaging was reviewed by a senior pancreatic surgeon (A.L.W.) who was
blinded to the patient's clinical history and the timing (pre- or post-FOLFIRINOX) of the
imaging. This individual did not participate in the care of any of these patients. After review
of the pretreatment imaging, 26 cancer patients were classified as LA and 14 as borderline.
After neoadjuvant treatment, 19 were classified as LA, 9 as borderline, and 12 as resectable
(Figs. 2A, B).
Operative Outcomes
Operative outcomes for the resectable patients were compared with the 40 resectable
patients who received FOLFIRINOX neoadjuvantly (Table 3). Pancreaticoduodenectomy
was the most common operation. Median operative time was significantly longer in the
FOLFIRINOX patients, when compared with the resectable group not receiving neoadjuvant
therapy. This increase in operative time was most likely due to the additional dissection of
critical vessels such as the SMA. Five venous resections were performed. These more
technically challenging operations resulted in a significant increase in blood loss. Despite
the longer operation and increased blood loss, overall postoperative morbidity was
decreased in the FOLFIRINOX group. Specifically, no patients in the FOLFIRINOX group
developed a pancreatic fistula. In addition, length of stay, mortality, and read-missions were
equivalent to those of the upfront resectable patients (Table 3).
Pathologic Results
Final pathology of the resected cancer demonstrated significant downstaging of the LA or
borderline cancer in patients treated with neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX with or without
chemoradiation. Only 35% of patients had positive lymph nodes, compared with 79% of

patients who went directly to the operating room (<0.001) (Table 4). Patients treated with
FOLFIRINOX also had significantly smaller tumors and lower rates of lymphovascular and
perineural invasion (Table 4). An R0 resection was achieved in 92% of patients, compared
with 86% of patients receiving no neoadjuvant therapy (P = NS). Four patients treated with
FOLFIRINOX had minimal (<1 mm) cancer and 2 no evidence of cancer on pathologic
examination, consistent with a complete response.
Disease-Free and Overall Survival
Median follow-up for the entire cohort was 11 months. For the patients receiving
neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX median follow-up was 13 months. Progression was documented
in 38% of patients receiving neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX, compared with 49% of patients
receiving no neoadjuvant therapy. Distant disease was the most common first site of
progression for both cohorts.
Patterns of progression are listed in Table 3. Median OS for the entire cohort was 34
months. Patients who received FOLFIRINOX and underwent surgical resection had a
significant increase in OS compared with the group of patients with clearly resectable
tumors who received no neoadjuvant therapy (P = 0.008) (Fig. 3). Both patients who had a
complete response are alive and free of disease at 8 months and 16 months.
Discussion
The majority of patients with PDAC present with metastatic or LA tumors. Historically
neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy rendered approximately one third of LA cancers
resectable.9,21 These patients, despite resection, recurred quickly with a median survival of
14 to 22 months.9,21 In the era of more effective chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX, there
has been a significant improvement in the median survival of patients with metastatic
disease, suggesting that this more aggressive approach may be useful in patients with LA
and borderline PDAC.
This study demonstrates that the historical criteria for determining resectability by cross-
sectional imaging are no longer appropriate in patients who receive FOLFIRINOX with or
without radiation therapy. This is the likely basis for the apparent persistence of criteria for
unresectability on imaging. A senior pancreatic surgeon blinded to the timing of the scans
deemed the majority of patients as still borderline or LA after therapy; however, the R0
resection rate was 92%. Despite a decrease in Ca19-9 levels and/or a decrease in the tumor
size, clear fat planes around critical vascular structures were not present on post-
FOLFIRINOX preoperative imaging. Pathologic analysis demonstrated no viable cancer, but
significant fibrosis from the therapy. Current radiologic imaging cannot distinguish between
fibrosis and viable cancer, which is the basis for the continued criteria for unresectability on
imaging. Our series suggests that despite the lack of historically accepted criteria for
resection on imaging, patients should be explored for attempted resection. Involved arterial
structures or narrowing of venous structures should be approached via serial frozen-section
biopsies before attempted resection. If biopsies are positive, resection should be abandoned
because an R1 or R2 resection is associated with a poor OS.22,23 Appropriate palliative
measures should be considered.

Patients who received FOLFIRINOX in this study were deemed either unresectable or
borderline. The FOLFIRINOX patients presented with more advanced cancers but were
younger and had a better ECOG performance score than patients who received an upfront
operation. However, despite the advanced nature of the cancers, the aggressive neoadjuvant
therapy, the prolonged operations, and increased intraoperative blood loss, patients treated
with FOLFIRINOX had a decreased postoperative morbidity compared with patients
presenting with clearly resectable disease. It is critical to note that no patients treated with
preoperative FOLFIRINOX experienced a pancreatic fistula, a major complication of
pancreatic cancer resections. A zero pancreatic fistula rate was also observed by Christians
et al.24 The technically more challenging operations in the FOLFIRINOX patients also did
not lead to increased mortality, length of stay, or 90-day readmission rates.
Imaging was unable to predict the encouraging pathologic results obtained in the patients
who received FOLFIRINOX with or without chemoradiation. A significant decrease in
lymphovascular and perineural invasion, as well as lymph node positivity, was identified
after FOLFIRINOX. Pathologic evidence of minimal to no tumor was demonstrated in 15%
of cases. Similar encouraging pathologic responses were described in the 12 borderline
patients resected by Christians et al.24 If traditional prognostic markers continue to be valid,
improvements in node positivity, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and R0
resection should translate into improved survival.
On the basis of early short-term follow-up, patients who presented with LA or borderline
resectable PDAC and received neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX with or without chemoradiation
had an improved OS when compared with patients who presented with resectable disease
and received no neoadjuvant therapy. A longer follow-up and more patients will be
necessary to confirm these results.
Conclusions
In summary, FOLFIRINOX with or without chemoradiation therapy has demonstrated
impressive improvements in patients with LA PDAC. Traditional imaging criteria for
resectability seem no longer to be accurate when evaluating posttreatment imaging. A more
aggressive surgical approach, which involves serial biopsies around involved vascular
structures before attempted resection, is justified by these findings. Because of the novelty
of this regimen, OS and disease-free survival data are still early, but the results are
encouraging. The improvement of traditional prognostic markers of survival and our early
survival data may translate into an increased long-term OS.
