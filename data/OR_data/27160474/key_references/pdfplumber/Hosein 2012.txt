Abstract
Background: 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) is superior to gemcitabinein
patients withmetastatic pancreatic cancer who have a good performancestatus. We investigated this combination
as neoadjuvanttherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).
Methods: In this retrospectiveseries,weincluded patients withunresectable LAPC who received neoadjuvant
FOLFIRINOX withgrowth factor support. The primary analysis endpoint was R0 resection rate.
Results: Eighteen treatment-naïve patients withunresectable or borderline resectable LAPC were treated with
neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX. The median age was 57.5 years and all had ECOG PS of0 or 1. Eleven (61 %)had tumors
inthe head of thepancreas and 9(50 %) had biliarystents placed prior to chemotherapy. A total of 146 cycles
were administered witha median of8 cycles (range 3-17) per patient. At maximum response or tolerability,7
(39 %)were converted to resectability byradiological criteria; 5 had R0 resections, 1had an R1resection, and 1 had
unresectable disease. Among the11 patients who remained unresectable after FOLFIRINOX, 3went onto have R0
resections after combinedchemoradiotherapy, giving an overall R0 resectionrate of 44 % (95 % CI 22–69 %). After
a median follow-up of 13.4 months, the1-year progression-free survival was 83 % (95 % CI 59-96 %)and the1-year
overall survival was 100 %(95 % CI 85-100 %). Grade 3/4 chemotherapy-related toxicities were neutropenia (22 %),
neutropenic fever (17 %), thrombocytopenia (11 %), fatigue (11 %), and diarrhea (11 %). Common grade 1/2
toxicities were neutropenia (33 %), anemia (72 %), thrombocytopenia (44 %), fatigue (78 %), nausea (50 %), diarrhea
(33 %)and neuropathy (33 %).
Conclusions: FOLFIRINOX followed by chemoradiotherapy is feasible as neoadjuvant therapy inpatientswith
unresectable LAPC. The R0 resectionrate of 44 % inthis population is promising. Further studies are warranted.
