Abstract
Background—Trials examining FOLFIRINOX in metastatic pancreatic cancer demonstrate
higher response rates compared to gemcitabine-based regimens. There is currently limited
experience with neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX in pancreatic cancer.
Methods—Retrospective review of outcomes of patients with borderline resectable or locally
unresectable pancreatic cancer who were recommended to undergo neoadjuvant treatment with
FOLFIRINOX.
Results—FOLFIRINOX was recommended for 25 patients with pancreatic cancer, 13 (52%)
unresectable and 12 (48%) borderline resectable. Four patients (16%) refused treatment or were
lost to follow up. 21 patients (84%) were treated with a median of 4.7 cycles. 6 patients (29%)
required dose reductions secondary to toxicity. 2 patients (9%) were unable to tolerate treatment
and 3 patients (14%) had disease progression on treatment. 7 patients (33%) underwent surgical
resection following treatment with FOLFIRINOX alone, 2 (10%) of which were initially
unresectable. 2 patients underwent resection following FOLFIRINOX + stereotactic body
radiation therapy (SBRT). The R0 resection rate for patients treated with FOLFIRINOX +/−
SBRT was 33% (55% borderline resectable, 10% unresectable). A total of 5 patients (24%)
demonstrated a significant pathologic response.
Conclusions—FOLFIRINOX is a biologically active regimen in borderline resectable and
locally unresectable pancreatic cancer with encouraging R0 resection and pathologic response
rates.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer accounts for only 3% of new cancer diagnoses but is the 4th leading cause
of cancer death and at current rates is suspected to become the 2nd leading cause of cancer
death by 2015[1]. Surgical resection offers the only hope for long term survival, however

nearly 80% of patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease[2]. A subset of
patients present with borderline resectable disease, for which neoadjuvant therapy has an
established role in obtaining an R0 surgical resection and improving long term survival[3-6].
Additionally, many patients present with locally advanced unresectable disease that with the
proper neoadjuvant treatment could potentially be downstaged to resectable disease [7-19].
In general, neoadjuvant treatment is becoming increasingly explored in hopes of improving
the prognosis of pancreatic cancer by treating micrometastases, reducing tumor volume and
increasing the likelihood of an R0 resection in locally advanced disease[20-22].
Traditionally, gemcitabine-based regimens have been utilized in the preoperative setting for
patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer[23]. However, neoadjuvant gemcitabine
based chemoradiation is associated with a relatively low R0 resection rate and few
significant histopathologic responses for borderline resectable and locally unresectable
disease[24]. Recently, the use of 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX)
has emerged as an alternative in pancreatic cancer. A randomized trial of FOLFIRINOX
versus gemcitabine in metastatic pancreatic cancer showed improved median survival from
6.8 to 11.1 months[25]. Further studies of FOLFIRINOX in advanced metastatic disease
have demonstrated improved response rates compared with gemcitabine and other historical
treatments while maintaining or improving quality of life[26-30]. Because of its efficacy in
advanced disease, there is interest in determining whether similar response rates can
influence the course of locally advanced disease. However, data is lacking regarding
FOLFIRINOX in the neoadjuvant setting for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
In this series, we retrospectively evaluate our experience with neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX in
patients with borderline resectable and unresectable pancreatic cancer. We specifically
evaluate the toxicity of the regimen, the impact of toxicity on delay in surgical resection and
postoperative complications and the outcome measures of CA 19-9 response, surgical
resection rate, R0 resection rate and histopathologic response to treatment.
Methods
Prior to initiation of the study, Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the
University of Pittsburgh (PRO12060156). A prospectively maintained multidisciplinary
pancreatic cancer clinic database was searched to identify patients with locally advanced
pancreatic cancer who were recommended to undergo treatment with FOLFIRINOX. Patient
demographics, chemotherapy response, operative and postoperative outcomes were
retrospectively reviewed. Resectability was defined per American Hepato-Pancreato-Billiary
Association/Society of surgical Oncology/ Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract
(AHPBA/SSO/SSAT) criteria[31]. Toxicity to chemotherapy was evaluated using the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. An R0 resection was defined as at least
1 mm of free margins[32]. Histopathologic response following treatment was graded
according to the criteria suggested by the College of American Pathologists[33]. Percentages
for outcomes following treatment are calculated based only on patients who initiated therapy
(21 overall; 10 unresectable, 11 borderline). Postoperative complications were evaluated
using the Clavien-Dindo method[34]. Pancreatic leaks were graded according to the
International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) definitions[35].
Because this was a retrospective study, there was no standardized protocol in place during
the course of treatment. Restaging typically consisted of a repeat CT scan and assessment of
the CA 19-9 level. The decision of when to restage was at the discretion of the treating
oncologist and varied based on individual patient factors. Treatment decisions were made by
a multi-disciplinary conference group that consisted of oncologists, surgeons, radiation
oncologists, radiologists and gastroenterologists. Patients who received radiation therapy

underwent fiducial placement by endoscopic ultrasound and were treated with stereotactic
body radiosurgery with 3 fractions of 12 Gy for a total of 36 Gy.
Results
FOLFIRINOX was recommended to twenty-five patients who were to undergo treatment for
locally advanced pancreatic cancer between February 2011 and October 2012. Median age
was 59 and 52% of patients were female (Table I). 13 patients (52%) had unresectable
disease and 12 patients (48%) were borderline resectable based on AHPBA/SSO/SSAT
criteria. Eighteen patients (72%) had proximal pancreatic tumors, while 7 patients (28%)
had distal pancreatic tumors. Four patients (16%) either refused treatment with
FOLFIRINOX or were lost to follow up prior to initiating treatment.
Patients received a mean of 5 cycles of FOLFIRINOX with most patients (57%) receiving
between 4-6 cycles (Table II). Patients who proceeded to surgery were treated with a mean
of 6 cycles. 6 patients (29%) required dose reductions during their course of treatment and 5
patients (24%) required temporary delay in treatment due to toxicity. The mean delay in
treatment was 1.5 weeks, with no delay longer than 2 weeks. Toxicity from treatment is
listed in Table III using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria grading. No patients were denied
surgery due to toxicity or side effects related to treatment. A flow chart for outcomes of
patients undergoing treatment for borderline resectable and unresectable disease is depicted
in Figure I. FOLFIRINOX was discontinued prior to surgical resection in 24% of those that
initiated treatment (5 patients). Reason for discontinuation of therapy included inability to
tolerate side effects (2 patients, 10%) and disease progression (3 patients, 14%). 5 patients
(24%) were treated with radiation therapy in addition to FOLFIRINOX. 4 patients (19%)
were treated with additional chemotherapy following FOLFIRINOX + SBRT.
Seven patients (33%) demonstrated a CA 19-9 response of at least 50% decrease following
treatment with FOLFIRINOX alone. Eleven patients (52%) who initiated treatment
underwent surgical exploration, 8 (73%) of the borderline resectable patients and 3 (30%) of
the unresectable patients. Of these, 1 patient from each group was found to have metastatic
disease, resulting in an overall resection rate of 43%, with 7 borderline resectable patients
(64%) and 2 unresectable patients (20%) undergoing surgical resection. The two
unresectable patients who were successfully resected had encasement of the superior
mesenteric and celiac arteries prior to initiation of treatment. The R0 resection rate overall
was 33%; with 55% of borderline resectable patients and 10% of unresectable patients
achieving R0 resection. Five patients (56% of those resected) required portal vein resection.
7 patients were resected after FOLFIRINOX alone (5 R0) and 2 patients were resected after
FOLFIRINOX + SBRT (2 R0). Histopathologic response to therapy was evaluated for all
patients undergoing resection. Grade 0, complete pathologic response with absence of viable
tumor cells, was seen in 1 patient (5%) after FOLFIRINOX alone. Grade 1, moderate
pathologic response, was seen in 4 patients (19%), 3 after FOLFIRINOX alone and 1 after
FOLFIRINOX + SBRT.
There was no perioperative mortality. Postoperative morbidity affected 77% of patients with
a majority of complications (60%) being Grade I or II. There was one grade IIIa
complication, (a peritoneal abscess requiring interventional radiology drainage) and one
grade IV complication (a small bowel perforation requiring exploration). Two patients
(15%) had pancreatic leaks, one grade A and one grade B.

Discussion
Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease, due in part to the fact that only 15% of patients
have resectable disease at presentation. For the significant number of patients with
borderline resectable and locally unresectable disease, surgical resection offers the best hope
for long-term survival and outcomes for those who are not ultimately resected are poor[36].
These patients have a significant potential to benefit from neoadjuvant therapy as they are
either not surgical candidates or at high risk for R1 resection.
Neoadjuvant treatment, including chemotherapy or chemoradiation for borderline resectable
and locally unresectable pancreatic cancer offers several advantages including: the potential
to downstage unresectable or borderline resectable tumors to enable surgical resection,
avoiding surgery in patients whose suffer disease progression while on neoadjuvant
treatment and circumventing the delay caused by postoperative recovery and surgical
complications in delivering adjuvant therapy[37]. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that
pancreatic cancer appears to be a systemic disease at the time of diagnosis. By the time most
pancreatic cancers are diagnosed, the primary tumor already contains clonal populations of
cells that are capable of giving rise to distant metastases[38]. Preclinical models have
demonstrated that circulating pancreatic cells are present even in animals with premalignant
pancreatic lesions, suggesting that pancreatic cancer is systemically disseminated even in its
early stages[39]. These data suggest a tremendous potential benefit to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, allowing for treatment of circulating cells prior to surgery and before they
have the opportunity to seed distant metastases. The benefits of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
are further supported by mathematical modeling, which suggests treatment with
chemotherapy prior to surgery will slow the growth rate of pancreatic cells and translate into
improved survival[40].
Despite the numerous proposed benefits to neoadjuvant treatment of borderline resectable
and locally unresectable, outcomes for regimens that are currently being utilized leave
significant room for improvement. A recently published meta-analysis of 111 studies
analyzing various neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens, a majority combined with
radiotherapy (94%), included a subset of patients with borderline resectable/unresectable
tumors. In these patients the resection rate following treatment was 33%, with an R0
resection rate of only 26%[41]. Another meta-analysis of 14 phase II clinical trials revealed
a resection rate of 32% with 20% R0 resection rate in locally advanced patients treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiation[42]. Gemcitabine-based
chemoradiation has been the historical treatment of choice for borderline resectable and
locally unresectable disease, however studies looking specifically at such regimens also
demonstrate a relatively low resection rate. A meta-analysis of preoperative gemcitabine
with or without chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer resulted
in 27% of patients being surgically resected and a R0 resection rate of 23%[24]. Another
recently published study of 215 patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation with
gemcitabine for locally advanced pancreatic cancer had a 26% resection rate with 10%
achieving a R0 resection[7]. Current neoadjuvant treatments have increased the number of
R0 resections for locally advanced disease, but many patients remain unresectable after
treatment and they may benefit from a more effective neoadjuvant regimen.
This retrospective study follows 25 patients with borderline resectable and locally
unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma through their course of treatment with
FOLFIRINOX in the preoperative setting. We demonstrate that neoadjuvant treatment with
FOLFIRINOX is safe, feasible, and has acceptable tolerability outside of a clinical trial.
84% of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who were offered the regimen
underwent treatment. No patients were denied surgery due to treatment toxicity and there

were no significant delays in surgical resection for patients who had a response to treatment,
an important outcome to consider with any neoadjuvant therapy. Additionally, postoperative
morbidity and the pancreatic leak rate for patients receiving FOLFIRINOX is historically
comparable to patients who were not treated with neoadjuvant therapy[43].
This series suggests that FOLFIRINOX is a highly active neoadjuvant regimen in borderline
resectable and locally unresectable pancreatic cancer. CA 19-9 response of >50%, which has
been linked to survival in studies evaluating response to treatment[44-46], was seen in 33%
of patients treated with FOLFIRINOX. Our overall resection rate of 43% and R0 rate of
33% are encouraging given the locally advanced disease in the patients evaluated. There
have been two series published evaluating FOLFIRINOX preoperatively for locally
advanced pancreatic cancer that demonstrated similar results to our findings. A study by
Hosein et al retrospectively evaluated 18 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer,
of which 78% were unresectable and 22% were borderline resectable[47]. Despite treating
with a median of 8 cycles, compared with 5 in our study, patients in their series had a similar
number of dose reductions (17%) and a similar toxicity profile. Their series demonstrated an
overall resection rate of 64% with overall R0 rate of 44%. For unresectable patients, the
resection rate was 43% with 36% achieving R0 resection. For the borderline resectable
patients, the resection rate was 75% with all of these patients achieving R0 resection. A
multi-institutional retrospective study of FOLFIRINOX in locally advanced and metastatic
pancreatic cancer demonstrated a 35% resection rate in the locally advanced cohort with no
mention of R0 resection rate[29]. 100% of borderline resections and 21% of unresectable
lesions made it to surgical resection. Our data, in conjunction with the previously published
using FOLFIRINOX in the neoadjuvant setting, suggest that the regimen may be at least as,
and likely more biologically active than other neoadjuvant regimens evaluated in the
literature and that neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX is a viable alternative to gemcitabine based
regimens currently being utilized. Additionally, it offers a platform to build upon that
utilizes non-overlapping chemotherapeutic agents to the historical gemcitabine standard.
Although FOLFIRINOX may represent an improvement when considered in the context of
historical controls, a majority of unresectable patients remained unresectable following
treatment leaving significant room for improvement in this devastating disease.
Our most encouraging finding is the rate of pathologic response to treatment (complete 5%,
19% moderate) following FOLFIRINOX alone. This is significantly higher than the
complete pathologic response rate with gemcitabine as reported in the literature, which is
around 2.5%[48, 49]. Furthermore, complete or near complete pathologic response has been
shown to translate into improved prognosis and survival, suggesting a possible survival
benefit to patients receiving FOLFIRINOX over gemcitabine-based regimens[48, 49].
In this retrospective study, 24% of patients received radiation therapy alone and 19% went
on to receive additional chemoradiation therapy following maximal anticipated effects of
FOLFIRINOX. The number of patients receiving radiation is somewhat lower than we
would expect in patients with locally advanced disease. Typically, patients were restaged
following chemotherapy and then presented at a multi-disciplinary conference where the
group made treatment decisions. Patients who had an adequate response to chemotherapy
alone proceeded directly to surgery and were not offered radiation. Radiation was typically
recommended to those who remained unresectable. While it is difficult to determine
retrospectively why patients did not undergo radiation therapy, it may be due to the
significant number of patients felt to have become resectable at restaging following
FOLFIRINOX treatment. The optimal treatment algorithm for use of neoadjuvant
FOLFIRINOX in conjuction with radiation and/or gemcitabine-based regimens has yet to be
determined and requires further research. These data also support a paradigm for future trials

delineating if particular subgroups of patients may benefit from a FOLFIRINOX compared
with a gemcitabine-based regimen.
This study is limited by its retrospective nature and by the small number of patients who
have received this therapy. Patients included in our series were young, with a median age of
59 and had good performance status. These patients are most likely to tolerate and benefit
from this aggressive regimen. Because of this selection bias, our results may not be typical
of the general pancreatic cancer population and at present FOLFIRINOX should be utilized
only in carefully selected patients. While we anticipate that the improved resection rate and
pathologic response rate demonstrated in our study may translate into improved survival, our
data is too immature for a thorough survival analysis, with a median follow up of <9
months. Additionally, the lack of a standardized protocol without a consistent treatment
algorithm makes interpretation of these results more challenging [50]. However, these data
are not intended to be the definitive evidence to utilize FOLFIRINOX in the neoadjuvant
setting, but rather to support the development of more definitive prospective randomized
trials of FOLFIRINOX. Despite these limitations, our study suggests that FOLFIRINOX
alone, or as part of multimodality approach, is a biologically active regimen in borderline
resectable and locally unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with encouraging R0
resection rates when considered in the context of historical treatment results. Further
research is needed to determine the utility of additional chemoradiotherapy with
FOLFIRINOX and to identify predictors of response in unresectable patients. Additionally,
randomized trials with FOLFIRINOX compared with gemcitabine alone or gemcitabine-
based regimens are necessary to determine the optimal neoadjuvant therapy in borderline
resectable and locally unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Synopsis
This study demonstrates neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX to be safe and biologically active in
borderline resectable and locally unresectable pancreatic cancer with an overall resection
rate of 43% and a 44% R0 resection rate. Additionally, there was a significant pathologic
response in 24% of patients.
