Abstract
The study aims were to determine the efficacy and toxicity of FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and
oxaliplatin) in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated at the Royal Marsden. Data from
49 patients treated with FOLFIRINOX between 2010 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Efficacy and
tolerabilityweresimilartothatreported inclinicaltrials.
Background:Pancreaticductaladenocarcinoma(PDA)hasaverypoorprognosis.TreatmentwithFOLFIRINOXhas
been shown to improve outcomes, but can be associated with significant toxicity. Materials and Methods:
A retrospective review was performed of all patients with locally advanced or metastatic PDA treated with FOLFIR-
INOXattheRoyal MarsdenbetweenNovember2010andNovember 2013.Efficacy,tolerability, andpotentialprog-
nostic factors were evaluated. Results: Twenty-seven patients with metastatic PDA and 22 patients with locally
advancedPDAweretreatedwithFOLFIRINOX.Patientsreceivedamedianof9cycles(range,1-26)ofFOLFIRINOX.
The overall response rate was 41% (20 patients), and a further 17 patients (35%) had stable disease. Thirty-five
patients (71%) received FOLFIRINOX in the first-line setting, with a median progression-free survival and overall
survival,respectively,of12.9monthsand18.4monthsforpatientswithlocallyadvanceddisease;and8.4monthsand
12.2monthsforpatientswithmetastaticdisease.ThemostfrequentlyoccurringGrade3/4toxicitieswereneutropenia

analysis, reduction in CA 19-9 of >50% (P < .001), normalization of CA19-9 (P < .001), surgery after FOLFIRINOX
(P ¼ .004), and use of prophylactic pegfilgrastim (P ¼ .005) were prognostic for overall survival. Conclusion: The
efficacy and tolerability of FOLFIRINOX for PDA at our institution is similar to that reported in clinical trials. Careful
selectionofpatientsandmonitoringofresponse(accordingtoCA19-9)andtoxicitiescanhelpmaximizeadvantagein
thispatientpopulation.

Subsequent Treatment After FOLFIRINOX
After completing treatment with FOLFIRINOX, 15 patients
(31%) received consolidation radiotherapy. Thirteen of these
patients received 54 Gy in 30 fractions with concomitant capeci-
tabine,1patientdiscontinuedchemoradiotherapyafter18fractions
because of the development of acute renal failure, and 1 patient
received CyberKnife (38 Gy in 3 fractions) to the pancreatic
surgicalbed.
Seven patients with LAPC underwent surgery (Table 5), with a
PFS of 29.9 months (95% CI, 1.3-58.7). One patient died
from liver failure after surgery, which was thought to be due to
an ischemic hepatic insult in the perioperative period on a back-
ground of steatohepatitis secondary to diabetes and prolonged
chemotherapy exposure. In addition, 2 patients with resectable
livermetastases underwent surgery, achieving R0 resections. These
2patientswerealiveanddisease-free at28months and8months,
