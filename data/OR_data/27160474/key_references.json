There is currently limited experience with neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX in pancreatic cancer.\n## METHODS\nRetrospective review of outcomes of patients with borderline resectable or locally unresectable pancreatic cancer who were recommended to undergo neoadjuvant treatment with FOLFIRINOX.\n## RESULTS\nFOLFIRINOX was recommended for 25 patients with pancreatic cancer, 13 (52%) unresectable and 12 (48%) borderline resectable. Four patients (16%) refused treatment or were lost to follow-up. Twenty-one patients (84%) were treated with a median of 4.7 cycles. Six patients (29%) required dose reductions secondary to toxicity. Two patients (9%) were unable to tolerate treatment and three patients (14%) had disease progression on treatment. Seven patients (33%) underwent surgical resection following treatment with FOLFIRINOX alone, 2 (10%) of which were initially unresectable. Two patients underwent resection following FOLFIRINOX\u2009+\u2009stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The R0 resection rate for patients treated with FOLFIRINOX\u2009\u00b1\u2009SBRT was 33% (55% borderline resectable, 10% unresectable). A total of five patients (24%) demonstrated a significant pathologic response.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFOLFIRINOX is a biologically active regimen in borderline resectable and locally unresectable pancreatic cancer with encouraging R0 resection and pathologic response rates.\n",

Quality of life (QOL) was assessed using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30).\n## RESULTS\nForty-seven patients were entered, and 46 received treatment. Thirty-five patients (76%) had metastatic disease. A total of 356 cycles were delivered, with a median of eight cycles per patient (range, one to 24 cycles). All patients were assessable for safety. No toxic death occurred. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 52% of patients, including two patients with febrile neutropenia. Other relevant toxicities included grade 3 to 4 nausea (20%), vomiting (17%), and diarrhea (17%) and grade 3 neuropathy (15%; Levi's scale). The confirmed response rate was 26% (95% CI, 13% to 39%), including 4% complete responses. Median time to progression was 8.2 months (95% CI, 5.3 to 11.6 months), and median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 14.4 months). Between baseline and end of treatment, patients had improvement in all functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30, except cognitive functioning. Responders had major improvement in global QOL.\n## CONCLUSION\nWith a good safety profile, a promising response rate, and an improvement in QOL, Folfirinox will be further assessed in a phase III trial.\n",

Patients with LAPC treated with FOLFIRINOX were identified via the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center pharmacy database. Demographic information, clinical characteristics, and safety/tolerability data were compiled. Formal radiographic review was performed to determine overall response rates (ORRs). Twenty-two patients with LAPC began treatment with FOLFIRINOX between July 2010 and February 2012. The ORR was 27.3%, and the median progression-free survival was 11.7 months. Five of 22 patients were able to undergo R0 resections following neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX and chemoradiation. Three of the five patients have experienced distant recurrence within 5 months. Thirty-two percent of patients required at least one emergency department visit or hospitalization while being treated with FOLFIRINOX. FOLFIRINOX possesses substantial activity in patients with LAPC. The use of FOLFIRINOX was associated with conversion to resectability in >20% of patients. However, the recurrences following R0 resection in three of five patients and the toxicities observed with the use of this regimen raise important questions about how to best treat patients with LAPC.\n",

            "abstract": "## PURPOSE\nOn the basis of the ACCORD trial, FOLFIRINOX is effective in metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), making it a rational choice for locally advanced PDAC (LA). Aims of this study are to evaluate the accuracy of imaging in determining the resectability of PDAC and to determine the surgical and clinicopathologic outcomes of pancreatic resections after neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX therapy.\n## PATIENTS AND METHODS\nClinicopathologic data were retrospectively collected for surgical PDAC patients receiving neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX or no neoadjuvant therapy between April 2011 and February 2014. Americas Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association/Society of Surgical Oncology/Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract consensus guidelines defined LA and borderline. Imaging was reviewed by a blinded senior pancreatic surgeon.\n## RESULTS\nOf 188 patients undergoing resection for PDAC, 40 LA/borderline received FOLFIRINOX and 87 received no neoadjuvant therapy. FOLFIRINOX resulted in a significant decrease in tumor size, yet 19 patients were still classified as LA and 9 as borderline. Despite post-FOLFIRINOX imaging suggesting continued unresectability, 92% had an R0 resection. When compared with no neoadjuvant therapy, FOLFIRINOX resulted in significantly longer operative times (393 vs 300 minutes) and blood loss (600 vs 400 mL), but significantly lower operative morbidity (36% vs 63%) and no postoperative pancreatic fistulas. Length of stay (6 vs 7 days), readmissions (20% vs 30%), and mortality were equivalent (1% vs 0%). On final pathology, the FOLFIRINOX group had a significant decrease in lymph node positivity (35% vs 79%) and perineural invasion (72% vs 95%). Median follow-up was 11 months with a significant increase in overall survival with FOLFIRINOX.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAfter neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX imaging no longer predicts unresectability. Traditional pathologic predictors of survival are improved, and morbidity is decreased in comparison to patients with clearly resectable cancers at the time of presentation.\n",

N Engl J Med 364:1817-1825, 2011), toxicities have tempered enthusiasm for its use in full doses. To assess the impact of dose attenuations on toxicity and efficacy, we reviewed our institution's experience with FOLFIRINOX in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) and MPC. We performed a retrospective review of dose, toxicity, and efficacy of FOLFIRINOX in all patients with LAPC and MPC treated between June 2010 and July 2011 at Yale. Toxicities in all patients and response rate (RR) and survival in previously untreated MPC were compared to data reported by Conroy. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Thirty-five patients were treated (16 LAPC; 19 MPC). Twenty-nine patients received dose attenuations with the first cycle. Median relative doses of irinotecan and bolus fluorouracil were less than those reported by Conroy (64 vs. 81 % and 66 vs. 82 %, respectively). RR was 50 % in LAPC and 47 % in MPC, and the latter did not differ significantly from the RR reported by Conroy (p = 0.19). OS at 6 and 12 months in MPC was comparable to OS reported by Conroy. Grade 3/4 toxicities were less than reported by Conroy, including fatigue (p = 0.009) and neutropenia (p < 0.0001). Nine patients experienced transient dysarthria during irinotecan administration. Our findings validate the efficacy and tolerability of FOLFIRINOX in LAPC and MPC and suggest that dose attenuations of irinotecan and bolus fluorouracil improve tolerability without compromising efficacy.\n",

            "abstract": "FOLFIRINOX is a highly active regimen for the treatment of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. However, treatment with FOLFIRINOX is associated with relevant toxicity and predictors for response to therapy are warranted. We retrospectively analyzed 49 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX in order to evaluate a possible predictive role of clinical parameters and tumor characteristics for response to chemotherapy. Tumor samples were characterized histopathologically before treatment and expression of p53 and Ki67 was analyzed using automated immunohistochemistry. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The overall objective response rate was 55.1%, the disease control rate was 70.6%. Female gender was associated with a significantly higher disease control rate of 91.7 compared to 48.0% in male patients (p=0.001) which reached 100% in female patients when primarily treated compared to treatment after surgical resection and relapse (77.8%, p=0.057). For all patients median PFS was 3.5 months (95% CI, 2.7-4.3 months) and median OS was 13 months (95% CI, 9.4-16.6 months). Female patients showed a tendency towards a longer median PFS (5.0 months, 95% CI, 3.6-6.4 months) compared to males (3.0 months, 95% CI, 2.4-3.6 months) (p=0.099). Serum levels of CA19.9 and CEA were significantly higher in female patients compared to male patients (p=0.037, p=0.05). Tumors of patients with response to FOLFIRINOX showed a higher expression level of p53 and Ki67 as well as higher serum levels of CA19.9 compared to non-responders, which was statistically not significant. Our study indicates that female gender is a positive predictor for therapy response to FOLFIRINOX in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Female gender in turn was associated with increased levels of tumor markers CEA and CA19.9 and patients with higher serum levels of CA19.9 were more responsive to FOLFIRINOX.\n",

The primary analysis endpoint was R0 resection rate.\n## RESULTS\nEighteen treatment-na\u00efve patients with unresectable or borderline resectable LAPC were treated with neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX. The median age was 57.5\u2009years and all had ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Eleven (61\u2009%) had tumors in the head of the pancreas and 9 (50\u2009%) had biliary stents placed prior to chemotherapy. A total of 146 cycles were administered with a median of 8 cycles (range 3-17) per patient. At maximum response or tolerability, 7 (39\u2009%) were converted to resectability by radiological criteria; 5 had R0 resections, 1 had an R1 resection, and 1 had unresectable disease.
