Objective: To study the effects of a lifestyle physical activity counseling program with feedback of a pedometer during pulmonary 
rehabilitation. 
Methods: Twenty-one chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients were randomized to an experimental group that followed a 
regular rehabilitation program plus the counseling intervention or to a control group that only followed rehabilitation. The primary outcome 
was daily physical activity assessed by pedometers. Secondary outcomes were physical ﬁtness, health-related quality of life, activities of daily 
living, depression and self-efﬁcacy. 
Results: The experimental group showed an increase of 1430 steps/day (+69% from baseline), whereas the control group showed an increase 
of 455 steps/day (+19%) ( p = 0.11 for group (cid:1) time interaction). The secondary outcomes showed no differences. 
Conclusion and practice implications: This study showed that the use of the pedometer, in combination with exercise counseling and the 
stimulation of lifestyle physical activity, is a feasible addition to pulmonary rehabilitation which may improve outcome and maintenance of 
rehabilitation results.

A major symptom experienced by patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is dyspnea during 
exertion. This symptom often leads to lower physical 
activity levels, which in turn may lead to deconditioning and 
a reduction in health-related quality of life. 
Pulmonary rehabilitation has proved to being able to 
reverse this process, and the effects are well documented 
[1–3]. However, long-term effects are less clearly deﬁned. 
Studies that have followed patients for a longer period show 
that beneﬁts diminish after about 1 year [4,5]. Ries et al. [5] 
hypothesized that due to the unstable nature of their disease,

COPD patients may easily return to the spiral of inactivity 
and deconditioning when an intensive maintenance strategy 
is absent after the rehabilitation. Interestingly, home-based 
pulmonary rehabilitation programs have proven to provide 
long lasting effects, even after 5 years. One important feature 
of these programs was the use of normal life style activities 
[6–8]. 
We hypothesize that a physically active lifestyle of 
patients with COPD is essential for maintaining the beneﬁts 
after rehabilitation. This can be achieved through lifestyle 
physical activities like walking, cycling, stair-climbing and 
gardening. By incorporating these activities during pul- 
monary rehabilitation, daily physical activity levels may 
remain higher after 
rehabilitation and the beneﬁts of 
rehabilitation may last longer. The Dutch Norms for Healthy 
Physical Activity (DNHPA), which is derived from the

norms of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) 
[9–11], serve as reference for the effects of lifestyle physical 
activities on health. 
In this study, we tried to enhance daily physical activity in 
patients with COPD by using a lifestyle physical activity 
counseling program with feedback of a pedometer. Such a 
program might be relevant for these patients because lifestyle 
physical activity programs turn out to be very effective in 
improving physical activity in healthy adults [12–14]. 
Because intensity and duration are interchangeable concern- 
ing energy expenditure in physical activity [15], lifestyle 
physical activities of moderate intensity with longer duration 
can replace high intensive physical activities of shorter 
duration. Low to moderate intensity activities are more 
appropriate for patients with COPD because of their low 
exercise tolerance, which is due to ventilator limitation and 
oxygen-uptake problems [16]. Furthermore, exercise coun- 
seling interventions have shown to be effective in increasing 
physical activity [17,18] and are of interest in maintaining 
physical activity [19], because they can be tailored to the 
needs and circumstances of the individual [17,19]. Finally, 
pedometers have proved to accurately detect steps taken, as an 
indication of volume of physical activity [20–22], and the 
feedback of the pedometer can be an important resource in 
increasing physical activity behaviors [23]. Pedometers offer 
new perspectives in changing physical activity behavior 
because patients can monitor themselves and can set concrete 
goals for increasing physical activity. Up to now, several 
studies have shown that pedometers are successful 
in 
increasing physical activity in healthy adults [24,25] and in 
various patient groups [26–30]. Scho¨nhofer et al. [31] 
demonstrated that pedometers are feasible to assess the level 
of physical activity in patients with COPD. 
Consequently, a lifestyle physical activity counseling 
program with continuous monitoring and feedback from a 
pedometer may be a suitable strategy for increasing and 
maintaining physical activity in patients with COPD. Until 
now, no intervention studies have been carried out that used a 
lifestyle physical activity counseling program with feedback 
of a pedometer in patients with COPD. Before long-term 
effects of this method can be measured, ﬁrst the short-term 
effects must be mapped out. Therefore, the purpose of this 
study was to investigate the short-term effects of a lifestyle 
physical activity counseling program with feedback of a 
pedometer during a standard pulmonary rehabilitation on 
daily physical activity. Secondary effects on physical ﬁtness, 
health-related quality of life, activities of daily living, 
depression and self-efﬁcacy were also measured. 


Patients who were referred for pulmonary rehabilitation 
were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control 
group. Patients in the experimental group followed a 
lifestyle physical activity counseling program with feedback 
of a pedometer next to a regular pulmonary rehabilitation 
program. The control group participated only in a regular 
pulmonary rehabilitation program. Patients in both groups 
to the pulmonary rehabilitation 
were examined prior 
(pretest) and after 9 weeks of rehabilitation (posttest). 
Descriptive characteristics and pulmonary function at 
baseline were assessed during a standard intake investigation 
prior to rehabilitation, and were carried out by the clinical 
staff, who was blinded for group assignment. 
In the control group, patients wore the pedometer 1 week 
prior to the rehabilitation and 1 week during week 9 of their 
rehabilitation. Patients in the experimental group wore the 
pedometer for 10 weeks (1 week prior to rehabilitation and 9 
weeks during rehabilitation). Patients were instructed to 
wear the pedometer over the course of the entire day until 
going to bed, and to record daily step counts in a diary. 
Patients also recorded in their diary at which time they put 
the pedometer on and at which time they put the pedometer 
off. 

Thirty patients entering pulmonary rehabilitation at the 
Groningen University Center 
for Rehabilitation were 
eligible. Twenty-nine patients agreed to take part in this 
pilot study and signed a written informed consent. Criteria 
for inclusion were diagnosis of COPD (Stages I–IV) [33], 
aged between 40 and 85 years, and being able to read and 
write in Dutch. Patients were excluded if they used a 
wheelchair, if they had signiﬁcant co-morbidity interfering 
with rehabilitation, and if they were assigned to rehabilita- 
tion modules other than the physical modules. 

Patients in both the experimental and control groups 
followed a regular pulmonary rehabilitation program 
according to evidence-based guidelines from the American 
College of Chest Physicians and the American Association 
of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation [2]. The 
rehabilitation program contained exercise training, dietary 
intervention and psycho-educational modules. 
The experimental group followed a lifestyle physical 
activity counseling program with feedback of a pedometer 
next to the regular pulmonary rehabilitation program. The 
aim of this intervention was to stimulate patients to increase 
their daily physical activity level by incorporating lifestyle 
physical activities into daily life. Patients received exercise 
counseling in order to motivate them to enhance physical 
activity in daily life and wore a pedometer in order to 
monitor changes 
in physical activity behavior. The 
pedometer was used as a motivational and feedback tool 
[29,30]. Lifestyle physical activities are physical activities 
that belong to the daily activity pattern (e.g. walking, 


cycling, stair-climbing and gardening). Physical therapists 
carried out the exercise counseling after being trained. The 
counselors followed the principles of motivational interview 
technique [34,35]. Four individually exercise counseling 
sessions were carried out during the course of the study. 
Each session took approximately 30 min. The ﬁrst 
counseling session was carried out 2 weeks prior to rehabili- 
tation and dealt with motivation for increasing physical 
activity. In this session, the pedometer with user instructions 
were given to the patient. The second counseling session was 
carried out in week 1 of the rehabilitation and dealt with 
goal-setting. The third counseling session was carried out in 
week 5 of 
the rehabilitation and dealt with shifting 
boundaries. Mean steps/day were evaluated and patients 
were asked to set a goal for seeking their maximal physical 
activity limit once (measured in numbers of steps). The 
fourth counseling session was carried out in week 7 of 
the rehabilitation and dealt with consolidation of physical 
activity behavior. Patients were asked to set a goal for their 
personal physical activity norm, which should be between 
their mean steps/day until then and their maximal number 
of steps. 

The primary outcome measure was daily physical activity 
and was measured by the Yamax Digi-Walker SW-200 
(Tokyo, Japan). In controlled laboratory settings, the Yamax 
SW series pedometers have consistently been shown to be 
among the most accurate. The SW-701 (which has the same 
step count mechanism as the SW-200) consistently gave 
values within 3% of actual steps taken during a self-paced 
walk, on an individual basis (Cronbach’s a 0.99) [21]. 
Subsequently, the SW-200 pedometer was found to be 1 of 
the 4 models (among 13) that accurately measures steps 
taken during free-living physical activity [22]. Finally, the 
SW-200 pedometer was found to have similar accuracy in 
normal-weight, overweight and moderately obese indivi- 
duals [36]. The SW-200 pedometer is easy to use. It is worn 
on the belt or waistband and responds 
to vertical 
accelerations of the hip during gait cycles. 
Secondary outcome measures were physical ﬁtness, 
health-related quality of life, activities of daily living, 
depression and self-efﬁcacy. Physical ﬁtness was measured 
by the ‘chair stand test’ (reliability: test–retest correlation r 
0.80), ‘the arm curl test’ (reliability: r 0.81), the ‘8-foot up- 
and-go test’ (reliability: r 0.95) and the ‘2-min step test’ 
(reliability: r 0.90) [37,38]. The 2-min step test 
is an 
alternative for the 6-min walk test, which is more space- and 
time-consuming. The rate of perceived exertion (RPE) 
during the 2-min step test is comparable to the RPE during 
the 6-min walk test, 13.9 and 13.6, respectively, suggesting 
that the exercise intensity of these two aerobic endurance 
tests is similar [38]. 
Two instruments were used to measure health-related 
life, namely the St. George’s Respiratory 

Questionnaire (SGRQ) [39], a disease-speciﬁc health status 
questionnaire, and the RAND-36 [40], a generic health 
status questionnaire. The SGRQ consists of 76 items that 
measure 3 components: ‘symptoms’ (problems caused by 
speciﬁc respiratory symptoms), ‘activity’ (restriction of 
activities by dyspnea) and ‘impacts’ (impact on everyday 
life caused by the disease) (reliability: test–retest correlation 
r 0.92) [39]. The RAND-36, which is a Dutch translation of 
the MOS 36-item Short-Form Health Survey [41], consists 
of nine subscales. In this study, ﬁve subscales were used: 
physical functioning (reliability: Cronbach’s a 0.92), vitality 
(Cronbach’s a 0.82), bodily pain (Cronbach’s a 0.88), 
general health perceptions (Cronbach’s a 0.81) and change 
in health status (an one item subscale: no a available) [40]. 
Two instruments were used to measure activities of daily 
living. Independent functioning in daily living was measured 
by the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale (GARS) and 
consists of 18 items about personal hygiene and household 
activities of daily living (reliability: reported Cronbach’s a 
range from 0.82 to 0.94) [42]. The Dutch Exertion Fatigue 
Scale (DEFS) measured exertion fatigue in the spheres of 
household, personal hygiene and social life. Exertion fatigue 
is deﬁned as fatigue that is directly related to activity. A low 
score relates to less exertion fatigue in activities of daily 
living (reliability: Cronbach’s a 0.91) [43]. 
Manifestations of depression were measured by the Beck 
Depression Inventory (BDI) [44]. The BDI is a self- 
administered 21-item self-report scale. The total score of the 
BDI indicates levels of depression, 0–4: possible denial of 
depression, 5–9: normal, 10–18: mild to moderate depres- 
sion, 19–29: moderate to severe depression and 30–63: 
severe depression (reliability: Cronbach’s a 0.81 for non- 
psychiatric populations) [45]. 
Self-efﬁcacy in physical abilities was measured by the 
LIVAS [46], which is a Dutch version of the Perceived 
Physical Ability Subscale of the Physical Self-Efﬁcacy 
Scale [47] (reliability: Cronbach’s a 0.70) [46]. 
Fat-free mass was measured by a bio-electrical impe- 
dance meter (Bodystat 1500). Fat-free mass index (FFMI) 
was calculated by dividing fat-free mass (in kg) by the 
square of height (in m2). Pulmonary function tests were 
performed following accepted standards [48], using a 
spirometer 
(Jaeger MS-IOS) and bodybox (Masterlab 
version 4.52i). 

Means and standard deviations (S.D.) were calculated for 
most descriptive characteristics at baseline. The Mann– 
Whitney test was used for interval and ratio data, 
the 
Chi-square test for nominal and ordinal data to test for 
signiﬁcant differences between experimental and control 
groups at baseline. 
The primary outcome measure of daily physical activity 
was mean steps/day for 7 days (a complete week) including 
rehabilitation activity (7Rplus). Patients attended our clinic 


3 days a week. The days of the week vary depending on the 
module that the patients follow; (a) Monday, Wednesday and 
Friday; (b) Monday, Wednesday and Thursday; (c) Tuesday, 
Thursday and Friday. The remaining 4 days without 
rehabilitation, 
including 1 weekend, formed the second 
step-count variable: 4Rmin. The third step variable was 
calculated by computing the weekend before pretest and 
posttest to 4Rmin. This variable thus consists of mean steps/ 
day for 6 days without rehabilitation, including 2 weekends 
(6Rmin). 
Means and S.D.s as well as 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) 
were calculated for most outcome measures. To facilitate 
the interpretation of results, effect sizes (d), calculated 
according to the method of Cohen [49], are also reported. An 
effect size of 0.2 is regarded as a small effect, 0.5 as a 
medium-sized effect, and 0.8 as a large effect [49]. 
Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test 
signiﬁcant group (cid:1) time interactions between the 
for 
experimental group and the control group, i.e. the effect 
of the counseling intervention. Besides, the power was 
calculated. This indicates the change to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant 
result, when there is an effect in the population indeed. 
Assumption of normality was tested with the Shapiro– 
Wilk test. Assumption of equality of covariance matrices 
was tested with the Box’s test. Statistical analysis was 
performed with the Scientiﬁc Package of Social Sciences 
(SPSS) version 11.5. A p-value < 0.05 (two-sided) was 
considered statistically signiﬁcant. 

Twenty-nine patients agreed to participate in this pilot 
study. Eight patients did not meet the inclusion criteria: ﬁve 
patients were excluded because they had no COPD and three 
patients because of the assignment to a rehabilitation module 
other than the physical modules. So, 21 patients were 
randomized to either the experimental or the control group. 
Five patients dropped out during the 9 weeks. Complete data 
sets were obtained from 16 patients (Fig. 1, ﬂow chart). 
Descriptive characteristics at baseline are shown in 
Table 1. There were no signiﬁcant differences in descriptive 
characteristics between both groups at baseline. 

The compliance of recording daily step counts in the dairy 
turned out to be very high; 91.7% during pretest and posttest in 
experimental and control group and 95.5% during the 10 
weeks that the experimental group wore the pedometer. There 
were no signiﬁcant differences in the mean time of wearing 
the pedometer during the day between experimental group 
(13.1 h/day) and control group (13.8 h/day). 

As shown in Table 2, the experimental group increased 
their mean steps/day by 1787 steps/day (+84% from

baseline) for 7 days including rehabilitation (7Rplus) and by 
1430 steps/day (+69%) for 6 days without rehabilitation 
(6Rmin). This in contrast with the control group, in which 
mean steps/day were increased by 1220 steps/day (+52%) 
for 7Rplus and by 455 steps/day (+19%) for 6Rmin. Effect 
sizes within the groups were large (>0.80) 
in the 
experimental group for 7Rplus, 4Rmin and 6Rmin and 
were smaller in the control group, especially for 4Rmin 
and 6Rmin. The effect of the lifestyle physical activity 
counseling program with feedback of a pedometer was not 
statistically signiﬁcant, but the between-groups effect size 
was large (>0.80) for 6Rmin. The power was 37%. 

Table 2 showed that there was a signiﬁcant effect of the 
intervention for the ‘8-foot up-and-go test’, but assumptions 
were violated. The effect of the intervention was borderline 
signiﬁcant for the ‘2-min step test’ with a large between- 
groups effect size (>0.80). No signiﬁcant effects of the 
intervention were found for the two other items of physical 
ﬁtness or 
life (HRQoL), 
activities of daily living (ADL), depression and self-efﬁcacy. 
Most effect sizes were small to medium. 



This study examined the effects of a lifestyle physical 
activity counseling program with feedback of a pedometer 
during 9 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation. The experi- 
mental group increased their mean steps/day by 1430 steps/ 
day (+69%) for 6 days without rehabilitation (6Rmin), 
whereas the control group showed an increase of 455 steps/ 
day (+19%). The difference in pretest and posttest between 
the experimental and control groups was clinically relevant, 
with an effect size >0.80. However, this was not statistically 
signiﬁcant. 
According to Tudor-Locke and Myers [50], older adults 
and those living with chronic diseases typically walk 
between 3500 and 5500 steps/day and would be classiﬁed as 
sedentary (<5000 steps/day) according to the preliminary 
classiﬁcation of pedometer-determined physical activity in 
healthy adults [23]. It is also noticed that this classiﬁcation 
might not be sustainable for older adults and those living 
with chronic diseases. There are a few studies that measured 
daily physical activity in patients with COPD with an 
accelerometer [51–53] and with a pedometer [31]. Patients 
in the latter study took approximately 3700 steps/day. In our 
study, patients took approximately 2200 steps/day at base- 
line and approximately 3400 steps/day at posttest. This is far 
less than Tudor-Locke and Myers [50] found in older adults 
and individuals with a chronic disease. It is also less than 
Scho¨nhofer et al. [31] found for patients with COPD. The 
included patients in that study were on average younger 
(56 (cid:2) 12 years) but had approximately the same lung 
function (FEV1 47 (cid:2) 9% predicted) than the patients in our 
study. This suggests that a reason for the low step count in 
our study is the higher age of our patients. In this respect, it 
has already been known that older adults take less steps/day 
[23]. Another reason for the lower steps/day score can be 
seasonal 
inﬂuences on daily physical activity. Energy 
expenditure in daily physical activity and leisure-time 
physical activity is signiﬁcantly higher in spring and summer 
[54–56]. Scho¨nhofer et al. [31] do not describe in which 
season they carried out their study. Our study was carried out 
in autumn and winter. 
No study has been carried out yet that uses a pedometer as 
a motivational and feedback tool together with exercise 
counseling in order to increase daily physical activity in 
patients with COPD. 
In two studies, healthy adults 
signiﬁcantly increase their daily steps from 8565 at baseline 
to 10,538 (+23%) after an 8-week pedometer-based lifestyle 
physical activity intervention [25], and from 4753 at 
baseline to 7949 (+67%) after an 8-week pedometer-based 
physical activity program [24]. The relative increases in 
number of steps/day in our study were more pronounced. 
This can be explained by the lower baseline score in our 
study: it is easier to gain a relative increase from a low 
starting-point than a high starting-point. But it could also be 
explained by the additional value of exercise counseling. 
Pedometer-based interventions are already successfully 
used to increase physical activity in various other patient 
groups as well [26–28]. The First Step Program (FSP) of 
Tudor-Locke et al. [29,30] for individuals with type-II 
diabetes is a pedometer-based lifestyle physical activity

intervention that corresponds largely with our lifestyle 
physical activity counseling program with feedback of a 
pedometer. A controlled outcome evaluation of the FSP 
showed that 
individuals with type-II diabetes in the 
experimental group increased their physical activity pattern, 
relative to the control group, with >3000 steps/day [30]. 
There were a number of factors in this study that caused 
methodological bias. The sample size of the study was small 
and the S.D.s of steps/day were large which resulted in a low 
power. In the same line, the low power probably accounts for 
the non-signiﬁcant 
results on the secondary outcome 
measures. Five patients dropped out during the study. An 
intention to treat analysis was not performed, because of the 
reasons. Finally, one disadvantage of using 
drop-out 
pedometers is that they are not sensitive to non-ambulatory 
activities (e.g. cycling, swimming, weight-training). Never- 
theless, walking is one of the most common forms of 
activity, and aggregate evidence provides abundant support 
for using pedometers to assess physical activity [57]. For 
future research, 
to develop step 
it would be helpful 
equivalents for the non-ambulatory activities, so that these 
activities can be taken into account. 

In summary, this study showed that the number of steps/ 
day increase after 9 weeks of rehabilitation. The additional 
lifestyle physical activity counseling program with feedback 
of a pedometer showed a clinically relevant increase in steps/ 
day, although not statistically signiﬁcant, on top of the 
this method is in 
rehabilitation effect. We expect 
particular of beneﬁt in maintaining the results of rehabilita- 
tion. A trial on long-term effects would therefore be 
desirable. However, further studies with larger patient 
groups and longer follow-up periods are needed to establish 
these preliminary results. 







The pedometer is a device that has become very popular 
in daily use as well as in science. They are simple in use, 
affordable, 
is 
extremely user-friendly [23] and accurately detects steps 
taken, as an indication of volume of physical activity [20– 
22]. This pilot study showed that the use of the pedometer, in 
combination with exercise counseling and the stimulation of 
lifestyle physical activity, 
is a feasible addition to the 
present-day pulmonary rehabilitation. The costs of imple- 
mentation and carrying out 
this program are minimal. 
Moreover, this program can easily be adopted in different 
settings. The patients who followed this lifestyle physical 
activity counseling program with feedback of a pedometer 
were very positive about this method and would recommend 
it to other patients. Also the physiotherapist who carried out 
the counseling sessions were enthusiast about this program. 
In sequel to this pilot study, a trial on long-term effects 
would be desirable. We think that this lifestyle physical 
activity counseling program with feedback of a pedometer is 
of use in chronic patients such as COPD in adopting a more 
physical active lifestyle.
