Background and objective: In patients with COPD, this 
study evaluated the effect on health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL) of adding ongoing feedback to a 12-month 
unsupervised maintenance walking programme. 
Methods: Participants were randomized to either an 
intervention group (IG) or control group (CG). Both 
groups completed the same 2-month supervised, walk- 
ing training programme followed by a 12-month unsu- 
pervised maintenance walking programme. During the 
maintenance programme, the IG received ongoing feed- 
back (telephone calls, biofeedback and progressive goal 
setting) and the CG received no feedback. 
Results: A total of 75 participants completed the study 
(mean (SD): age 69 (8) years; forced expiratory volume 
in 1 s (FEV1) 43 (15) % predicted). There was no 
between-group differences in the magnitude of change 
in HRQoL when data collected on completion of the 12- 
month maintenance programme were compared with 
that collected either before the 2-month supervised pro- 
gramme (mean between-group difference (MD) in total 
St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire change scores: 
1 point, 95% CI: −9 to 7) or on completion of the 2- 
month supervised programme (MD: 4 points, 95% CI −2 
to 10). 
Conclusion: Following a 2-month supervised walking 
training programme, ongoing feedback was no more 
effective than no feedback in maintaining HRQoL dur- 
ing a 12-month unsupervised walking programme.

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is signiﬁ- 
cantly reduced compared with healthy individuals1 and 
better HRQoL has been related to reduced hospital admis- 
sions.2 Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has been shown to

Ongoing feedback (telephone calls and biofeedback) 
was no more effective than no feedback during a 
12-month unsupervised walking programme that 
followed a short-term supervised walking pro- 
gramme. Based on these ﬁndings, further research 
is needed to investigate the optimal design of unsu- 
pervised maintenance programmes 
in patients 
with COPD. 



improve HRQoL3 as well as improve exercise capacity and 
reduce hospital admissions in patients with COPD.4–6 Fol- 
lowing completion of short-term (6–12 weeks) PR pro- 
grammes, the positive effects on HRQoL and exercise 
capacity3 have been shown to decline within 1–2 years.7–9 
Maintenance exercise programmes aim to encourage 
long-term adherence to exercise in order to preserve the 
beneﬁts achieved during short-term programmes. While a 
recent systematic review concluded that maintenance pro- 
grammes with supervised exercise sessions, conducted at 
least once per week can maintain exercise capacity for up 
to 6 months in patients with COPD,10 many PR pro- 
grammes lack the capacity to offer long-term supervised 
maintenance exercise programmes.11–13 

investigating 
unsupervised maintenance programmes have shown 
little effect on maintaining HRQoL and exercise capac- 
ity, despite using strategies to encourage adherence 
such as telephone support with or without monthly 
supervised exercise sessions.7,14,15 When biofeedback 
strategies have been added to telephone support, 
maintenance of effects has been shown.16,17 However, 
these previous ﬁndings should be interpreted with cau- 
tion due to limitations arising from very small sample 
size17 and short durations of follow-up.16,17 As such, the 
effectiveness of telephone support combined with bio- 
feedback to maintain HRQoL and exercise capacity dur- 
ing an unsupervised maintenance walking programme 
over a longer time period remains unknown. 
The primary aim of this study was to evaluate, in 
patients with COPD, the effect on HRQoL of adding 
ongoing feedback (telephone calls, biofeedback via 
pedometer and progressive goal setting) compared 
with no feedback during a 12-month unsupervised 
maintenance walking programme, which followed a 
supervised walking training programme. The hypothe- 
sis was that, at study completion, participants who 
received the ongoing feedback would have better 
HRQoL compared with those who did not receive the 
ongoing feedback. The secondary aim of the study was 
to evaluate the effects of the ongoing feedback on exer- 
cise capacity and adherence to the maintenance walk- 
ing programme. 

The study was a long-term, prospective, assessor- 
blinded, multicentre (ﬁve sites), RCT with concealed 
allocation. Participants were randomized prior to com- 
mencing a 2-month supervised walking training pro- 
gramme (i.e. baseline) via an independent telephone 
randomization service using computerized random 
number generator sequencing into two groups: an 
intervention group (IG) and a control group (CG). 
Before commencing the 12-month maintenance pro- 
gramme, both groups received the same 2-month inter- 
vention of a supervised, walking training programme, 
two to three times per week. The ﬁndings of the 2- 
month study have been previously reported, comparing 
the effects of supervised walking training (combined IG 
and CG) to a group who received usual medical care 
and did not participate in any exercise training.18 The 
intervention for participants in the IG and CG only 
differed once they entered the 12-month maintenance 
phase. Randomization was stratiﬁed according to lung 
function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) < or 
≥40% predicted), HRQoL measures using the St 
George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (total score 
< or ≥45), exercise capacity (6-min walk distance 
(6MWD) < or ≥70% predicted) and trial centre. 
Participants were recruited from outpatient PR pro- 
grammes in two cities within Australia between May 
2009 and June 2012. Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
have been previously described.18 Written informed 
consent was obtained from all participants. The study 
was approved by the ethics committees of Sydney 
South West Area Health Service (Sydney, Australia), 
The University of Sydney (Sydney, Australia), Curtin 
University (Perth, Australia), Sir Charles Gairdner Hos- 
pital (Nedlands, Australia) and Bentley Hospital (Perth, 
Australia). 
Following completion of the short-term supervised 
programme, both the IG and CG were instructed to 
perform unsupervised maintenance walking exercise, 
3 days a week for 12 months starting at the same dura- 
tion achieved in the ﬁnal week of supervised training 
and at a pace which elicited a dyspnoea score of three 
to four on a modiﬁed 0–10 point category-ratio dys- 
pnoea scale.19 In addition, the IG received telephone 
calls, biofeedback provided via a pedometer (G-Sensor 
accelerometer, Pedometers Australia, Cannington, 
Australia) and progressive goal setting (based on 
pedometer data). Diaries were provided for participants 
in both groups to record details of completed walking 
sessions. Further details of the intervention and the tel- 
ephone script can be found in Appendices S1 and S2 
(Supplementary Information). 
Assessment protocol and measurements 
Participants were assessed on four occasions over a 14- 
month period as follows: (i) prior to commencing the 
2-month supervised walking 
training programme 
(baseline assessment), (ii) at the end of the 2-month 
supervised walking training programme which marked 
the commencement of 
the maintenance phase (2- 
month assessment), (iii) after 6 months of maintenance 
(8-month assessment) and (iv) after 12 months of 
maintenance (14-month assessment). During the base- 
line assessment, age, height, weight, gender, co-morbid 
conditions and medication use were recorded. Levels 
of anxiety and depression were measured by the Hos- 
pital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).20 At all four 
assessment time points, participants completed mea- 
sures of HRQoL, exercise capacity and spirometric lung 
function over two visits within a 7-day period. FEV1 
and forced vital capacity (FVC) were collected using a 
calibrated portable spirometer (EasyOne spirometer, 
ndd Medical Technologies Inc., Andover, MA, USA) 
according to standard procedures. Lung volumes (body 
plethysmography) and single-breath diffusing capacity 
of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were meas- 
ured at baseline only, according to standard protocols. 
Measures obtained were compared with normative 
data.21–23 Disease severity was classiﬁed according to 
the Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, 
and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 
(GOLD) spirometric criteria.24 



Health-related quality of life 
The primary outcome was HRQoL measured by the 
SGRQ.25 The interviewer-administered Chronic Respi- 
ratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ), with the indivi- 
dualized dyspnoea domain, was also completed.26 
Exercise capacity 
Functional exercise capacity was measured by the 6- 
min walk test (6MWT), peak exercise capacity by the 
incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) and endurance 
exercise capacity by the endurance shuttle walk test 
(ESWT).27 Procedures for the walk tests have been pre- 
viously described.18 
Adherence to unsupervised maintenance 
walking programme 
Adherence in both groups was determined using data 
from diaries and also, for the IG, by reviewing tele- 
phone transcripts. At 
the 8-month and 14-month 
assessments, the number of returned diaries in both 
groups was recorded, as well as the number of com- 
pleted telephone transcripts in the IG. 

Sample size and data analysis 
The sample size was based on detection of a clinical 
meaningful difference in total SGRQ score between the 
IG and CG at the 14-month assessment. Eighty-six par- 
ticipants were sufﬁcient to provide 80% power to detect 
a between-group difference in SGRQ total score of at 
least 7.7 points, which is greater than the minimum 
clinically important difference (α = 0.05, two-sided).28 
This assumed an SD of 12.7 points in total SGRQ score 
as previously reported.29 To allow for a 10% dropout, 
95 participants were required. Data were analysed 
using SPSS software (Version 20 for Windows, IBM Inc, 
Armonk, NY, USA). Intention to treat analysis was con- 
ducted with no imputation of missing data. Descriptive 
statistics are presented as raw mean values and SD 
unless otherwise stated. Linear mixed models (LMM) 
were used to determine signiﬁcance between groups 
across all time points using the sample that was availa- 
ble at each time point. An estimate of the within-group 
effect on three comparisons, baseline to 2 months; 
baseline to 14 months; and 2 to 14 months, was deter- 
mined for each group using the least signiﬁcant differ- 
ence (pairwise comparison) and is reported as mean 
differences and 95% CI from the predicted values of 
the LMM. To evaluate the between-group treatment

determined by simple subtraction of the within-group 
effect and differences in the change scores were com- 
pared using independent t-tests. 

Participant ﬂow is presented in Figure 1. Baseline charac- 
teristics of participants were similar between groups 
(Table 1). Participants had moderate to severe COPD 
(FEV1: 45 (15) % predicted),24 reduced HRQoL (SGRQ 
total score: 46 (17)), reduced exercise capacity (6MWD: 
74 (13) % predicted) and symptoms of anxiety and 
depression that were within normal range (0–7 points on 
HADS20). Participants completed an average of 17 (7) out 
of a possible 24 supervised walking training sessions prior 
to commencement of the maintenance programme. Of 
the 95 participants who commenced the 2-month super- 
vised walking training programme, 20 participants (21%) 
did not complete any of the 14-month outcome measures. 
No adverse events were reported during the study. 
Health-related quality of life 
The SGRQ outcomes are presented in Tables 2–4 and 
Figure 2A. Both the IG and CG signiﬁcantly improved 
SGRQ total score at the end of the 2-month supervised 
walking training programme. Between-group analyses 
demonstrated no signiﬁcant differences in the change 
in SGRQ from baseline to 14 months or from 2 to 
14 months (Fig. 2A). The results from the CRQ are pre- 
sented in Tables S1–S3 (Supplementary Information). 
Exercise capacity 
The exercise capacity outcomes are presented in 
Tables 2–4 and Figure 2B. Both the IG and CG signiﬁ- 
cantly improved exercise capacity measured by the ESWT 
with the IG also signiﬁcantly improving on the ISWT and 
6MWT at the end of the 2-month supervised walking pro- 
gramme. Between-group analyses demonstrated no sig- 
niﬁcant differences in change in exercise capacity from 
baseline to 14 months or from 2 to 14 months. 
Adherence to unsupervised maintenance 
walking programme 
Reported levels of adherence to unsupervised mainte- 
nance walking exercise sessions are presented in 
Table S4 (Supplementary Information). Between-group 
analyses of adherence levels were not possible due to 
lack of data in the CG. 

This large, multicentre, RCT was designed to determine 
the effects on HRQoL of adding ongoing feedback to a 
12-month unsupervised maintenance walking pro- 
gramme that followed a 2-month, supervised, walking 
training programme in patients with COPD. Although 
produced signiﬁcant

improvements in HRQoL in both groups, when all 
assessment time points were considered, there were no

no difference between groups in the SGRQ during a 
12-month unsupervised maintenance exercise pro- 
gramme despite the IG receiving monthly supervised 
sessions.7 However, some evidence of the effectiveness 
of the ongoing feedback in the IG was demonstrated by 
score being maintained from 2 to 
SGRQ total 
14 months and remaining signiﬁcantly better 
than 
baseline in the IG by the end of the study. In contrast, 
in the CG, there was a signiﬁcant decline in SGRQ total 
score from 2 to 14 months and this had returned to 
baseline levels by the end of the study. 
The ESWT is an outcome which represents endur- 
ance walking capacity and is particularly sensitive to 
the effects of short-term training in COPD.27 Both 
groups had signiﬁcant improvements in ESWT time fol- 
lowing the short-term training. In the IG, there was a 
non-signiﬁcant decline in ESWT time from 2 to 
14 months which remained signiﬁcantly better at 
14 months compared with baseline. In contrast, the CG 
had a signiﬁcant decline in ESWT time from 2 to 
14 months and this had returned to baseline levels by 
the end of the study, demonstrating no maintenance of 
endurance walking capacity in this group. There were, 
however, no between-group differences in ESWT time 
when changes from baseline to 14 months or 2 to 
14 months were compared. This ﬁnding is in contrast 
to previous RCTs or studies that demonstrated mainte- 
nance of functional exercise capacity during unsuper- 
vised maintenance 
that 
walking 
investigated a similar combination of telephone sup- 
port with biofeedback.16,17 However, 
these previous 
studies were limited by lack of blinded assessment,16 
small sample size17 and short follow-up periods of 316 
and 617 months. In addition, participants in these previ- 
ous studies16,17 were randomized following completion 
of short-term PR whereas in our study, randomization 
occurred at commencement of the supervised walking 
training. Participants who complete PR may be more

adherence of 52% to the prescribed walking exercise

that reported in other studies7,31,32 and may be a more

COPD than that collected via diaries. A further explana- 
tion for the lack of between-group difference may be 
that both groups were instructed to do walking exercise 
during the maintenance programme, thus potentially 
reducing the between-group differences. This contrasts 
with a previous maintenance study17 in which the com- 
parison group did not do maintenance exercise and the 
use of telephone calls and pedometers was effective at 
producing between-group differences in HRQoL at 
6 months following completion of the initial training 
programme, mainly due to a decline in HRQoL in 
the CG.17 
A limitation of the study was the relatively large loss 
to follow-up (21%) during the maintenance phase 
which meant that the target of 86 participants complet- 
ing the study was not reached. This dropout rate is 
consistent with 
in 
COPD.7,15,17,33 A larger sample size would have been 
unlikely to change the between-group differences as 
the P-values were not close to being signiﬁcant and the 
magnitude of the differences were less than the mini- 
mum clinically important differences so unlikely to be 
important. A second limitation of the study was that a

Data was determined from the predicted means from Linear 
Mixed Model (LMM). ESWT: endurance shuttle walk test; ISWT:

compliant with exercise and be more motivated to par- 
ticipate in long-term exercise training, which could 
have contributed to the positive effects on exercise 
capacity.16,17 We chose to randomize participants prior 
to commencing a short-term PR programme as this is 
more representative of 
the patient population and 
patient journey. 
While HRQoL and ESWT were maintained in the IG, 
this did not translate into between-group differences 
which may have been a consequence of a number of 
factors, in particular, that the changes were small in 
relation to the variability in measurements. The small 
effect of the intervention may have resulted from the 
relatively poor adherence to the unsupervised walking 
programme, which was somewhat surprising as we 
hypothesized that the regular feedback and ongoing 
support using health coaching principles30 would have 
resulted in improved adherence during the mainte- 
nance phase. It appears from our ﬁndings that this 
level of support was not sufﬁcient or appropriately tar- 
geted to change exercise behaviour and encourage 
adherence in patients with COPD in order to maintain 
a signiﬁcantly greater HRQoL and exercise capacity 
than those not receiving such interventions. Adherence 
remains difﬁcult to objectively measure and hence self- 
reported diaries are often used; however, our results 
demonstrated limited engagement in the use of diaries. 
While adherence levels in the CG appeared to be 
higher than in the IG, this only reﬂected the low num- 
ber of diaries returned in the CG rather than greater 
adherence. A greater amount of data was available on 
the level of adherence in the IG due to information col- 
telephone calls. The IG 
lected during the regular 






per-protocol analysis was not possible as there were 
insufﬁcient data to determine accurate adherence to 
the maintenance walking programme, due to the 
inadequacies of diary use. 
In future studies, more 
objective measures of adherence would help inform 
clinicians about the true effect of unsupervised mainte- 
nance interventions in adherent participants. Despite 
these limitations, the strength of this study was the 
robust methodological design using intention-to-treat 
analysis with participants recruited prior to short-term 
thus reﬂecting real-life 
supervised exercise training, 
clinical practice. 
In conclusion, this study investigated the effects on 
HRQoL of adding ongoing feedback to a 12-month 
unsupervised maintenance walking programme that 
followed a 2-month supervised walking training pro- 
gramme in patients with COPD. There were no 
between-group differences in the magnitude of change 
in HRQoL from baseline to 14 months or from 2 to 
14 months. Based on these ﬁndings, ongoing feedback 
was no more effective than no feedback in maintaining 
the gains of short-term supervised walking programme. 
As long-term supervised maintenance exercise pro- 
grammes are not always an option following PR, fur- 
ther research is needed to investigate the optimal 
design of unsupervised maintenance programmes in 
patients with COPD.
