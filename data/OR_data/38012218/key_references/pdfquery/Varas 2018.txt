physical activity level of COPD patients is low, and it is not modified with the classic 
PR programmes. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a community‐ 

Methods: 
Stable COPD patients were assigned to either an experimental group (EG, 
n = 17) who followed a community‐based 8‐week programme consisting of exercise train- 









[1,553, 5,118]), and Baecke scores (1.6 [0.2, 3.1], p < 0.01). SGRQ scores decreased 
(−5.4 [−8.6, −2.4], p < 0.01). These results remained evident after 3 and 12 months 



Conclusions: A community‐based programme of exercise training through walking 
and increased physical activity, using pedometers as feedback, produces short‐ and 
long‐term improvements in exercise capacity, physical activity level, and quality of life 












improved through pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Nevertheless, despite 
the well‐known benefits provided by PR programmes (McCarthy et al., 
2015; Spruit et al., 2013), their implementation is limited (Rochester 
et al., 2015). Self‐administered programmes are an interesting option

Moreover, the duration of the effects of PR is limited, with decline 
beginning after 6–12 months (Spruit et al., 2013). For this reason,

total number of steps by 10–20% in relation to the previous 
checking for confounding factors. For the analysis of the normality 
of the variables, we used the Shapiro–Wilk test. 
In all of the 
analyses, we assumed a level of confidence (1 − α) of 0.95 (level 
of significance α = 0.05). The program used was SPSS® Statistics

of the total daily training time and its distribution in cycles. The goal of 
number of steps that each subject had to reach in each walking cycle is 
detailed in the column on the right, where “n” is the number of steps taken 
in 1‐min walking at the speed of the last level completed on the incremen- 
tal shuttle test and “t” is the duration of each cycle. Achieving this goal 
meant that they had walked at optimal speed for most of the time in each 
walking cycle.

nity‐based programmes, which primarily aim to increase PAL in COPD 
patients and even fewer that combine self‐administered exercise 









The benefits obtained in exercise capacity and quality of life indi- 
cate that this type of programme both produced a short‐term training 

patients autonomously adopted the regular practice of physical exer- 
cise. The programme was based on so‐called critical speed, which is 

period of time and which corresponds to 90% of VO2max (Casas et al., 
2005). It is a simple and objective system that, employing a pedome- 

quently, it is easy to apply, which is a key factor in ensuring that 
people stick to the programme in the long term. High‐speed walking 

fully in previous studies (Liu et al., 2008; Mitchell et al., 2014). More- 
over, the use of feedback systems—such as a musical programme, 

(Pradella et al., 2015) or the level of dyspnoea (de Sousa Pinto, Martín 
Nogueras, Calvo Arenillas, & Ramos González, 2014)—also obtained 
good results. In contrast, Dias et al. 
(2013) found no changes in 
exercise capacity in a high‐speed walking plan with no specific speed 












(Altenburg et al., 2015; Moy et al., 2016). This could be due to the 
fact that reduced symptoms—associated with increased exercise 
capacity—enable patients to initiate more activity on their own, 












been useful 
in motivating patients to walk more. A recent study 
found no differences in the number of steps after PR—based on 
cyclo‐ergometer training—between those subjects who also received
