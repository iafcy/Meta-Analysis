Background and Objective: Limited evidence on long-term effects of physical activity 
programs in COPD is available. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of a three- 
month program combining physical activity counselling and pedometer-based feedback in 
addition to usual care, followed by a nine-month unsupervised observation period as 
compared to usual care in participants with severe to very severe COPD. 
Methods: Participants were randomized to either a control group receiving usual care or an 
intervention group receiving motivational support, an activity diary with an individual step 
count goal (ie, an increase of ≥15% from baseline) and a pedometer in addition to usual care. 
The intervention ended after three months and an unsupervised observational period fol- 
lowed until twelve months. Primary outcome was daily step count after one year. 
Results: Seventy-four participants were included, 61 (82%) completed the study. Linear regres- 
sion modelling, adjusted for baseline step count, showed no significant difference in change in step 
count after 12 months between the groups (Β = 547.33, 95% CI = −243.55/1338.20). 
Conclusion: A three-month program combining physical activity counselling and ped- 
ometer-based feedback in addition to usual care does not attenuate the declining course of 
physical activity in participants with severe and very severe COPD during a long term 
follow-up of one year as compared to usual care. This result was primarily determined by the 
low intervention response rates to the combined program.

Plain Language Summary 
Combined physical activity counselling and pedometer-based feedback is a promising inter- 
vention towards physical activity enhancement in participants with COPD. However, scarce 
long-term data on its effects are available. In this study, we investigated the effects of three 
months combined physical activity counselling and pedometer-based feedback, followed by 
a nine-month unsupervised observation period as compared to usual care in participants with 
severe to very severe COPD. We found that the three-month combined program was not 
superior to usual care in preserving physical activity after one year. Interestingly, a similar 
number of participants in both groups managed to improve their physical activity.

Introduction 
Physical activity (PA) is an important predictor and prognostic factor of health 
status in apparently healthy populations.1 It is well recognized that changes in PA

behavior ameliorate health outcomes.1 In chronic obstruc- 
tive pulmonary disease (COPD), low PA levels are com- 
mon and a known risk factor for worsening disease status 
(ie, increased risk of COPD-related hospitalization and 
mortality),2 while peripheral muscle dysfunction progres- 
sively exacerbates the deficiency.3 Despite this, access to 
and uptake of multimodal rehabilitation is low4–6 and may 
only partially recover PA impairment.2 
Considering the broad applicability and relatively low 
cost of PA programs makes them appealing for implemen- 
tation in the COPD population. Accordingly, programs 
targeting PA directly are a promising treatment option. 
However, a recent Cochrane review found conflicting evi- 
dence regarding the effectiveness of various interventions 
aiming to increase PA in COPD.7 The included studies 
used a wide range of different interventions, devices and 
outcomes, hampering comparison.7 Among the various 
interventions 
investigated, combining PA counselling 
with pedometer-based feedback showed the most promis- 
ing results.8 There is consensus that the measurement of 
PA needs continuous and accurate monitoring to provide 
valuable feedback, which state-of-the-art pedometers and 
accelerometers can achieve nowadays. In addition, they 
have become widely available and affordable, enabling 
broad application in clinical practice. Looking at the avail- 
able evidence on combined PA counselling and ped- 
in detail, participants with 
ometer-based 
a baseline PA of less than 10ʹ000 steps per day seem to 
profit most.9 Furthermore, limited evidence on the long- 
term effects of such programs is available.2,10 Building on 
these findings, the combined program may be suitable for 
participants with more severe COPD, commonly experien- 
cing more pronounced PA impairment and more severely 
impaired participation in activities of daily living. 

Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of a three- 
month program combining PA counselling and pedometer- 
based feedback in addition to usual care, followed by 
a nine-month unsupervised observation period as com- 
pared to usual care in participants with severe to very 
severe COPD. Furthermore, we aimed to explore predic- 
tors enabling these participants to accomplish an increase 
in PA. 
Materials and Methods 
Study Subjects 
Data collection ran between May 2017 and May 2020. 
Participants aged 40 years or older with confirmed severe 
and very severe COPD (ie, FEV1 <50% pred.) according 
to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung 
Disease (GOLD)-guidelines11 were assessed for eligibility 
out of outpatient pulmonary clinic patient pools and 
approached during outpatient visits or via 
letter. 
Participants with diagnosed mental or physical disability 
precluding informed consent or compliance with the pro- 
tocol, experiencing acute or recent (ie, within the last 6 
weeks) exacerbation of COPD, attending pulmonary reha- 
bilitation within the last 6 months and pregnant partici- 
pants were not included. 
Study Design 
A single-center parallel group, randomized controlled trial 
was performed at 
the Department of Pulmonology, 
University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. Randomization 
was performed on a 1:1 ratio using sealed envelopes. 
The study was conducted in accordance with the 
declaration of Helsinki and all subjects provided written 
informed consent. The Ethics Committee of the Canton of 
Zurich approved the study (EK-ZH-NR: 2016-00151), and 
the study 
registered on www.ClinicalTrials.gov, 
is 
NCT03114241. 
Methods 
Experimental Design 
Participants were randomized to either a control group 
receiving usual care or an intervention group receiving 
PA counselling and pedometer-based feedback in addition 
to usual care (ie, regular visits at their respiratory 
physician). 


intervention group 
to 
received a pedometer (HJ-325-EB, Omron Healthcare 
Co., Kyoto, Japan) and used it as a motivational and 
feedback tool. Furthermore, they were provided an activity 
diary concerning their daily activities, step counts and 
factors influencing their PA. PA counselling consisted of 
a familiarization session and individually determined daily 
PA goal setting (ie, an increase in step count of 15% 
compared to the baseline value).12 Thereafter, monthly 
telephone calls were performed until the three-month fol- 
low-up visit. The calls were of motivational nature; 
addressing the diary of the previous month, encouraging 
protocol compliance and supporting participants in identi- 
fying and coping with barriers towards enhanced PA. 
Sessions and phone calls were performed by the same 
investigator, a respiratory physiotherapist, ensuring consis- 
tency. The PA counselling program ended after three 






months. Following the study visit, participants kept their 
pedometer and were encouraged to sustain their increased 
level of PA until the end of the study at 12 months. No 
further motivational calls or support were provided. 
Daily Physical Activity 
The number of steps per day, an indicator for PA, was 
measured through a validated, triaxial accelerometer of 
a multisensory activity monitor (SenseWear Pro™; 
Bodymedia Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA).13 The monitor 
was worn on the upper left arm for seven consecutive 
days at baseline, at three and at 12 months (end of study) 
by both groups. Participants were instructed to wear the 
device for 24 hours a day, except while showering or 
swimming. The threshold for valid data from the armband 
was set at a usage time of 4 days with a minimum of 22.5 
hours per day.2 Seasonality was assessed by the season 
during which the visit took place (ie, summer, autumn, 
winter, and spring). 
Respiratory Variables 
All participants underwent pulmonary function testing 
according to the American Thoracic Society and European 
Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines to measure 
forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced 
vital capacity (FVC), and lung diffusion capacity of carbon 
monoxide (TLCO).14,15 Values were obtained after short- 
acting bronchodilator application. The tests were performed 
by pulmonary function laboratory staff being unaware of the 
study protocol and blinded to group allocation. 
Exacerbations 
Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) were defined as 
increases in dyspnea, cough and/or sputum production 
leading to the prescription of antibiotics and/or corticos- 
teroids. AECOPD requiring hospital admission were 
defined as 
severe acute exacerbations of COPD 
(SAECOPD). Data on AECOPD and SAECOPD during 
the study was acquired through the comparison of partici- 
pant reports and medical records from the general practi- 
tioner, pulmonologist and hospital. 
COPD-Specific Health Status 
Subjective health status capturing COPD symptom burden 
was recorded by the COPD assessment test (CAT), a valid 
and reliable questionnaire for the COPD population.16 
chair without armrest and a seat height of 46 cm. For 
safety reasons, the chair was positioned against a wall. 
Participants were instructed to stand-up and sit-down as 
often as possible at a self-chosen speed during one minute 
and the number of sit-to-stand repetitions was counted. 
Participants were told to place their hands at the hips and 
were not allowed to use them to assist movement. Verbal 
encouragement was not provided during the test, except 
the information when 15s were left until the test termi- 
nated after 60s.17–20 
Analysis 
All results are shown as mean (SD) unless otherwise stated, 
normal distribution of the variables was determined visually 
using quantile-quantile plots. A two-sided p-value of <0.05 
was considered to be statistically significant. Data were 
analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. 
The primary outcome of the study was change in daily 
step count, an indicator for PA, from baseline to 12 months 
after inclusion. Sample size calculation was planned to 
detect a difference in daily step count of 725 (1000) 
steps per day between the groups at study end and is 
based on data from our previous cohort.21 Calculation 
determined 37 participants per group to be sufficient, 
yielding at a power of 80%, setting α to 0.05 and account- 
ing for a dropout rate of 15%. 
For the analysis of the primary outcome, a linear 
regression model containing the change in daily step 
count between baseline and 12-month follow-up as the 
dependent variable and group allocation as an independent 
variable was fitted. The model was adjusted for differences 
in baseline step count between the study groups. The same 
model was applied to the sample when stratified according 
to an increase in PA by ≥15% at 3 months. 
Predictors towards an increase in PA by ≥15% were 
analyzed using a linear regression model containing the 
change in daily step count between baseline and 3-month 
follow-up as the dependent variable and group allocation, 
age, sex, body-mass-index, smoking status, pack years, 
FEV1, CAT-score, seasonality, and number of exacerba- 
tions as independent variables. 
Statistical analysis was performed using R (R Core 
Team 2019, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 
Vienna, Austria). 
Functional Exercise Capacity 
The 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1MSTS) was performed 
using a standardized protocol17–19 on a conventional 
Results 
Seventy-four participants were included, of whom 61 
(82%) completed the study, see Figure 1. The sample 






had a mean age of 66 (9) years, was mainly male (68%) 
and diagnosed with severe COPD (FEV1% pred. 35.04 
[9.92] %). There were no apparent differences in baseline 
characteristics between the groups regarding age, sex, 
body-mass index, smoking status, pack years and airflow 
obstruction, for complete baseline patient characteristics 
see Table 1. The intervention group showed clinically 
relevant higher mean daily step counts and repetitions in 
the 1MSTS at baseline compared to the control group. 
Participants discontinuing the study did not differ from 
study completers in terms of baseline characteristics listed 
in Table 1. 
Mean step count at baseline in the intervention group 
was 3708 (3601) steps, and 2451 (1819) in the control 
group, respectively. After three months 4462 (4955) steps 
in the intervention, and 2883 (2547) in the control group, 
respectively. At the primary endpoint after 12 months, step 
count was 4101 (3997) steps in the intervention, and 2137 
(2547) in the control group, respectively (see Figure 2). The 
absolute change in step count after 12 months was −108 
(1057) steps in the intervention, and −480 (1703) steps in 
the control group, respectively. The changes in step count 
according to group allocation are shown in Figure 3. Linear 
regression modelling, adjusted for baseline step count, 
showed no significant difference in change in step count 
after 12 months between the groups (Β=547.33, 95% CI= 
−243.55/1338.20, p = 0.171). Results of linear regression 
modelling are displayed in Table 2.

Stratifying the participants according to their change in 
PA of ≥15% or <15% until the three-month follow-up 
showed that equal amounts of participants per group 
increased their baseline step count ≥15% (13 in the inter- 
vention vs 14 in the control group). A majority of partici- 
pants in both groups did not increase their step count 
above the threshold (20 in the intervention vs 19 in the 
control group). 
A statistically significant and clinically relevant differ- 
ence in change in step count after 12 months, adjusted for 
baseline step count, was observed when stratifying the sam- 
ple according to an increase ≥15% in PA at 3 months 
(Β=1105.58, 95% CI=376.87/1834.30, p = 0.004). The abso- 
lute change in step count after 12 months was 303 (1170) 
steps in the ones increasing PA ≥15%, and −742 (1472) steps 
in the ones not doing so, respectively. The course of step 
count according to PA change is shown in Figure 4. The 
identified younger age as 
linear 
a significant predictor (Β=−111.92, 95% CI=−212.34/- 
11.50, p = 0.03) towards a positive response (ie, increase in 
daily step count ≥15% from baseline) in the control group. 
Regarding the responders in the intervention group, the 
model identified a higher baseline step count (Β=0.31, 95% 
CI=0.13/0.48, p = 0.001) as a significant predictor. Results of 

linear regression modelling assessing predictor variables is 
shown in Table 3. Severity of airflow obstruction overall 
declined by −0.09 (0.17) l during one year. 
Regarding secondary outcomes, CAT-score differences 
from baseline to 12 months were not clinically relevant 
with −1.6 (8.3) in the intervention, and −1.3 (7.5) points in 
the control group, respectively. The 1MSTS repetition 
differences were −0.5 (6.9) in the intervention, and 1.0 
(7.2) repetitions 
the control group, respectively. 
Absolute differences in primary and secondary outcomes 
are displayed in Table 4. 

Discussion 
Our study found no relevant difference regarding the 
change in step count after one year between a group 
receiving a three-month program combining PA counsel- 
ling and pedometer-based feedback in addition to usual 
care, followed by a nine-month unsupervised period in 
comparison to a control group receiving usual care. 
A comparable number of participants in both groups 
increased their step count by ≥15% up to three months 
after baseline. 
Our findings do not support the application of the 
described intervention in participants with severe and very 
severe COPD. The design consisted of limited counselling 
contacts and easy-to-handle pedometers aiming to provide 
a widely accessible and implementable program at scalable 
cost. Similar approaches were previously applied in two 
studies including participants with mild to moderate 
COPD.8,9 Of which one found promising short-term 
results.8 The second found matching long-term results to 
ours in the subgroup recruited from primary care.9 Regular 
phone calls and activity diaries have previously been shown 
to increase short-term PA in severe COPD.22 However, they 
used more frequent phone calls during a very short interven- 
tion period (ie, two weeks).22 It remains to be studied if 
a similar intervention to ours with more frequent counselling 
via phone would alter the results. However, interventions 
providing feedback, motivational support and diaries in an 
internet-based manner found matching results to our 
investigation.23,24 The more frequent and easily accessible 
feedback accordingly does not seem to enhance response to 
the physical activity intervention. 
Interestingly, a comparable number of participants in 
both groups increased their step count to or above the cut- 
off. The consequent stratified analysis showed statistically 
and clinically relevant lower changes in daily step count 
after 12 months in participants having increased their PA

≥15% at three months, suggesting that this threshold is 
effective in terms of preserving PA over one year. 
Comparing the observed preservation of PA to an observa- 
tional study, a benefit of >1600 steps per day upon response 
is assumed.21 On the one hand, our findings suggest a low 
response rate or adherence to the intervention under inves- 
tigation. On the other hand, they indicate that a certain 
phenotype of participants might be responsive. More speci- 
fically, 14 participants in the control group responded to the 
usual care setting (ie, information from the treating physi- 
cian that increased PA is beneficial) with an increase in PA 
to or above the defined threshold. Aiming to identify pre- 
dictors towards this beneficial behavior, our linear regression 
model suggested that younger age and higher baseline PA 
enable a response towards increased PA. 
Participants with severe and very severe COPD experi- 
ence impairment in multiple dimensions, such as PA, 
exercise capacity, and health-related quality-of-life. Our 
findings are in line with previous investigations,10 suggest- 
ing that a one-dimensional target might not be sufficient to 
achieve relevant and sustained PA changes in this popula- 
tion. However, in some very specific patient groups simple 
PA counselling may be sufficient, while others do not 
respond to a combined intervention (ie, PA counselling 
and pedometer-based feedback). We suggest to adapt PA 
interventions more closely to various phenotypes which 
have to be investigated in further studies. Considering the 
high behavioral contribution towards a change in PA,10 
a multidimensional and possibly repeated intervention 
might be required in severely diseased participants. 
Additionally, a certain threshold of exercise tolerance

seems necessary to improve PA.10,25 Since pulmonary 
rehabilitation is effective in terms of increasing exercise 
tolerance,26 further studies may investigate PA counselling 
programs including pedometer-based feedback implemen- 
ted or subsequent to such. 
This study has some limitations, while pedometers 
are known to accurately measure step counts, precision 
attenuates in slow walkers.27 Participants with severe 
COPD may be severely impaired in walking and our 
PA measure might therefore underestimate their step 
count. However, we used a validated device in the 
outcome. 
COPD 





Furthermore, 
towards 
a behavioral change might be a predictor towards treat- 
ment response, which we did not systematically assess. 
However, engaging 
in a PA study already forms 
a motivational statement. Complementing this, enrol- 
ment was low with 831 participants not responding to 
a participation request. We may only speculate about the 
reasons therefore. Our inclusion criteria with a rather 
strict attempt to control for effects resulting from 
exacerbation and pulmonary rehabilitation might restrict 
eligible participants. In addition, the long follow-up 
period might reduce excitement for participation. The 
dropout rate of 13 participants surpassed the assumed 
rate of 15% by 3%. However, participants who discon- 
tinued the study were not different in terms of baseline 
characteristics as compared to the ones finishing the 
study. 
Conclusions 
In conclusion, a three-month program combining PA coun- 
selling and pedometer-based feedback in addition to usual 
care has no impact on the course of PA in participants with 
severe and very severe COPD during a long term follow- 
up of one year as compared to usual care. This result was 
primarily determined by the low intervention response 
rates to the combined program. Our results suggest that 
low-frequency PA counselling in combination with ped- 
ometer-based feedback should not be implemented into 
clinical practice of participants with severe to very severe 
COPD. Future research might integrate more recent 
advances (such as web-platforms, home-monitoring) in 
targeting PA impairment in COPD.
