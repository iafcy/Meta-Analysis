Abstract 
This multi-centred, randomised controlled trial explored the effects of adding ongoing feedback to a 12-month unsupervised 
maintenance walking program, on daily physical activity (PA) in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Partici- 
pants were randomised to either an intervention group (IG) or a usual care group (UCG). During the maintenance program, 
the IG received ongoing feedback (telephone calls, biofeedback provided via pedometer and progressive goal setting) and 
the UCG received no feedback. The SenseWear® Pro3 Armband was used to measure PA. Of the 86 participants {IG = 42, 
(mean [SD]: age 70 [7] years; FEV1 43 [16] % predicted); UCG = 44, (age 69 [9] years; FEV1 44 [15] % predicted)} included 
at baseline, 43 had sufficient data to be included in the final analysis. There were no between-group differences in any of the 
PA variables from baseline to completion of the program (all p > 0.05). Ongoing feedback was no more effective than no 
feedback in improving PA during a 12-month unsupervised walking program. 
Trial Registration: The trial was registered in the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry 
(ACTRN12609000472279). 


In people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), increasing participation in physical activity (PA) 
is considered important with higher levels of daily PA asso- 
ciated with reduced hospital utilisation and mortality [1, 2]. 
One intervention that offers promise to increase PA is pul- 
monary rehabilitation (PR) [3–5]. This is because PR, with 
the core component being supervised exercise training, has 
been shown to improve exercise capacity and reduce symp- 
toms of dyspnoea and fatigue [6]. Where access to compre- 
hensive PR is poor [7–9], a simple program of ground-based 
walking training (GBWT) may be an alternative strategy 
for the provision of exercise training and has previously 
been shown to increase exercise capacity and health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) [10]. Nevertheless, there is little

evidence that gains made after a comprehensive PR program 
translate into an increase in participation in PA [3, 11]. In 
a recent meta-analysis, a significant increase in PA com- 
pared to usual care [4] [standardised mean difference (95% 
CI): 0.84 (0.44–1.25)] was demonstrated following exercise 
training but this finding was in contrast to an earlier review 
of uncontrolled studies which showed only a small, signifi- 
cant increase in PA following training (overall mean effect 
size = 0.12; p = 0.01) [3]. 
As walking is the most common form of PA undertaken 
during daily life, it was hypothesised that a simple program 
of supervised GBWT would translate into an increase in 
participation in PA but this was not the case in the short- 
term [12]. As studies in this area often assess the immediate 
or short-term impact of PR, it is conceivable that improve- 
ments in PA may take longer to attain, and may be achieved 
during a subsequent maintenance program that specifically 
includes interventions designed to encourage adherence to 
ongoing exercise training. Therefore, the aim of this study 
was, in people who had completed a program of GBWT, 
to evaluate the effects on PA of adding ongoing feedback 
(telephone calls, biofeedback via pedometer and progressive 
goal setting) to a 12-month unsupervised maintenance walk- 
ing program compared to no feedback in people with COPD. 

This brief report presents longitudinal PA data from a 
long-term, prospective, assessor-blinded, multi-centre 
randomised controlled trial (RCT) [13]. Participants with 
COPD were recruited from referrals to seven outpatient PR 
programs in two cities in Australia. The trial was registered 
in the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry 
(ACTRN12609000472279). Details of inclusion and exclu- 
sion criteria, randomisation and stratification have previ- 
ously been described [13]. Participants were randomised to 
either an intervention group (IG) or usual care group (UCG). 
Before commencing the 12-month maintenance period, both 
groups received the same 2-month intervention of super- 
vised GBWT, two or three times per week with effects on 
exercise capacity, HRQoL and PA being previously reported 
[10, 12]. In the maintenance period, both groups were 
instructed to perform unsupervised walking training, 3 days 
a week for 12 months. In addition, the IG received telephone 
calls, feedback provided via a pedometer (G-Sensor acceler- 
ometer, Pedometers Australia, Cannington, WA, Australia) 
and progressive goal setting (based on pedometer data) as 
previously described [13]. 
Physical activity was measured using the SenseWear® 
Pro3 Armband (SWA) (Bodymedia Inc, SenseWear Pro- 
fessional version 6.1, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) worn by par- 
ticipants for 7 days on three occasions over a 14-month 

period as follows: T1 (baseline assessment), T2 (2 month 
assessment end of GBWT) and T3 (end of 12-month main- 
tenance period). Measures of PA were expressed as daily 
energy expenditure (kcal), daily step count and time spent 
in sedentary activities [1.0 to < 1.5 metabolic equivalents 
(METs)], light intensity PA (1.5 to < 3.0 METs), moderate 
intensity PA (3.0 to < 6.0 METs) and vigorous intensity PA 
(time spent at ≥ 6.0 METs). To be included in the analyses, 
participants needed to contribute SWA data over a minimum 
of 3 days for at least 20 h each day. At all time points par- 
ticipants completed measures of HRQoL, exercise capacity 
and spirometric lung function as previously described [13]. 

As the primary aim of the original study was to evaluate 
the effect of the intervention on HRQoL [13], sample size 
calculations were undertaken to ensure adequate power to 
detect a meaningful between-group difference in the mean 
total St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire score between 
the IG and CG at T3. These calculations determined that a 
sample size of 88 participants was required. Regarding the 
analyses presented on the longitudinal PA data, a sample of 
88 participants would be sufficient to detect a between-group 
difference in average daily step count of 1200 steps assum- 
ing a SD of 2000 steps (two-sided α of 0.05, power of 80%) 
[14]. Data were analysed using SPSS software (Version 20 
for Windows, SPSS Inc, Chicago, ILL, USA). Linear mixed 
models were used to determine significance between groups 
across all time points using the sample that was available at 
each time point. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted 
with no imputation of missing values. A p value < 0.05 was 
considered significant. 

Eighty-six participants {(IG = 42 (30 males; mean [SD]: 
age 70 [7] years; FEV1 43 [16] % predicted); UCG = 44 (23 
males; age 69 [9] years; FEV1 44 [15] % predicted)} com- 
menced the maintenance study. At T2, 62 participants (IG: 
33, UCG: 29) and at T3, 43 participants (IG: 23, UCG: 20) 
had sufficient SWA data to be included in the analysis. The 
SWA was worn on average for six days (at least 23 h per day) 
in both groups at each time point. Results of the PA analyses 
are presented in Table 1 with change in average daily steps in 
both groups presented in Fig. 1. On completion of the main- 
tenance period, no significant between-group differences 
were demonstrated in the change in average daily energy 
expenditure, step count or time spent in sedentary, light, 
moderate or vigorous PA from T1 to T3 or from T2 to T3.

This study is one of only a few rigorous RCTs that have 
investigated the effects of a maintenance exercise training 
program on PA in COPD. We hypothesised that although 
short-term supervised GBWT did not result in an immedi- 
ate change in PA [12] it may have taken longer for changes 
in PA to occur. In standard clinical practice, it is costly to 
provide ongoing supervision following completion of short- 
term supervised exercise training programs. In this study, it 
was hypothesised that a telephone intervention providing 
ongoing feedback (biofeedback via pedometer and progres- 
sive goal setting) would result in improvements in PA as 
previous literature has demonstrated that with the addition 
of biofeedback strategies to telephone support, maintenance 
of effects of short-term programs on HRQoL and exercise 
capacity have been shown [15, 16]. Since both groups had 
the capability to do more, as evidenced by improved exercise 
capacity at the end of the 2-month supervised walking train- 
ing [10], improvements in PA might have been expected, 
especially in the IG. This study has not confirmed our 
hypothesis. The lack of effect on PA in the IG may be attrib- 
uted to the fact that the participants were only instructed to 
wear the pedometers during their walking training sessions 
and not instructed to use them to monitor participation in 
daily PA. Consequently, the ongoing feedback provided by 
the pedometer was to encourage participants in the IG to 
walk at an appropriate intensity during their regular exercise 
sessions rather than specifically to walk more in daily life. 
The main limitation in this study was the lack of available 
PA data at the T3 time point which was attributed to both 
a 21% loss to follow-up in the maintenance study and only 
43 participants having available SWA data at T3. Although 
this lack of data creates uncertainty around the accuracy of 
the results, a power calculation of our final sample demon- 
strated that 43 participants at T3 would have been sufficient 
to detect a larger between-group difference in average daily 
step count of 1700 steps. 
In conclusion, this study investigated the effects of ongo- 
ing feedback on PA during a 12-month unsupervised main- 
tenance walking program compared to no feedback. Despite 
the hypothesis that ongoing feedback would improve PA lev- 
els during a maintenance program, there were no between- 
group differences in any PA variables from T1 to T3 or from 
T2 to T3. Further studies are required to determine effec- 
tive methods of facilitating improvements in PA levels to 
take advantage of improvements in exercise capacity that 
are evident after a supervised exercise program in people 
with COPD.
