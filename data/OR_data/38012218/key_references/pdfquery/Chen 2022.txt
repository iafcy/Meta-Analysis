Abstract: Background and objectives: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
suffer from impaired pulmonary function and dyspnea, which result in limited levels of physical 
activity, and impaired quality of life. Exercise and regular physical activity have been proven to 
break the vicious circle. The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the effects of a walking program 
on exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with COPD. Materials and Methods: Patients with 
COPD were randomly assigned to a pedometer group (PG) or control group (CON). Subjects in the 
PG walked target steps daily with a pedometer for six weeks. Before and after the program, the 
following measurements were performed: pulmonary function test (PFT), daily steps, Six-Minute 
Walk Test (6 MWT), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), and quality of life questionnaire (SF-12). Results: 
After this walking program, PG (n = 15) signiﬁcantly improved their daily steps from 4768.4 ± 2643.3 
steps to 7042.7 ± 4281.9 steps (p = 0.01). Forced vital capacity (FVC) increased from 2.5 ± 0.7 L to 
2.8 ± 0.9 L (p = 0.02). CAT scores decreased from 14.9 ± 8.8 points to 11.5 ± 7.5 points (p = 0.03). In 
the control group (n = 11), there were no differences in any outcomes after this daily walking program. 
Conclusions: For patients with COPD, a daily walking program with a pedometer is beneﬁcial in the 
improvement of pulmonary function, daily steps, and quality of life. 


Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a leading cause of mortality and 
morbidity worldwide, is projected to rise from 5.4 million in 2005 to 8.3 million in 2030 [1–3]. 
In the United States, COPD was the third most common cause of death and the only disease 
among the top 10 that continued to increase in prevalence [4,5]. An international guideline 
states that regular physical activity is beneﬁcial for COPD patients by improving symptoms, 
functional independence, and quality of life [1]. 
However, physical inactivity is a major clinical feature of COPD. As the disease 
progresses, COPD causes breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance, resulting in the 
reduction of physical activity levels. Decreased physical activity levels are often associated 
with poor lung function, muscle strength decline, impaired quality of life, and frequency of 
hospitalization [6,7]. 
Interventions to increase the physical activity level of COPD patients are essential 
for the improvement of prognosis. Inpatient and/or outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation

programs have been proven to improve exercise capacity and quality of life in patients 
with COPD [8]. Guidelines for the management of COPD have suggested that pulmonary 
rehabilitation including exercise should be provided [8]. However, there are barriers for 
COPD patients participating in hospital-based pulmonary rehabilitation programs, such as 
transportation requirements, geographic distance from the hospital, and adherence to the 
pulmonary rehabilitation program [9,10]. Thus, there is a need to ﬁnd a convenient and 
effective intervention to promote physical activity for COPD. 
Walking is a common physical activity and is essential for the independence of per- 
forming activities in daily life. Daily steps and time spent on the steps have been suggested 
as indicators of functional capacity [11]. Pedometers are easy to use and can provide 
feedback to individuals about their daily activities. Studies showed that pedometers are 
an effective tool to monitor and increase physical activity in healthy populations [12]. 
However, it is unclear whether the use of pedometers has similar beneﬁts in COPD popula- 
tions. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a pedometer-based 
home walking program on the levels of physical activity. The secondary outcome was to 
determine its effects on pulmonary function, symptoms, and quality of life. 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Study Participants 
This was a prospective, randomized study. We recruited patients with a clinical di- 
agnosis of COPD referred to the pulmonary rehabilitation program from the pulmonary 
outpatient department of the Tao-Yuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Wel- 
fare, Taiwan, if they met the following criteria: (1) diagnosed with COPD according to 
the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria [13]; (2) in a 
medically stable condition (i.e., at least four weeks since the last exacerbation), (3) able 
to walk unassisted, and (4) ≥40 years of age. The exclusion criteria were receiving home 
oxygen therapy, hemodynamic instability, other pulmonary diseases, and comorbidities 
that affect physical activities in daily life such as severe neurological, musculoskeletal, or 
cardiovascular conditions. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration 
of Helsinki and was approved by the hospital’s institutional review board (TYGH106081). 
Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to inclusion. Basic data such 
as demographics, anthropometrics, and diagnoses were recorded at the time of admission 
to the study. 

The subjects were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group according to 
a computer-generated algorithm. Subjects were randomly assigned to either the pedometer 
group (PG) or control group (CON). 
In the pedometer group, patients received a pedometer and the task of walking at home 
for six weeks. They attached a pedometer (which shows the number of steps) on their wrist 
for approximately 12 h (from awakening until going to bed) each day, seven days/week for 
six weeks. They were also asked to walk at home as much as possible to try to reach the 
target daily steps. The target steps were set as 100–110% of their average daily steps from 
the previous week, with the ﬁrst week’s target derived from the baseline measurement, 
eventually up to 10,000 steps. The investigators asked for patients’ subjective responses 
and checked the patients’ pedometers during weekly visits. The investigators then reset 
the target step for the following week according to the patients’ responses and pedometer 
daily step count. In the control group, patients received counseling during weekly visits 
for six weeks. Patients were encouraged to be active at home and walk ≥ 30 min per day 
without any supervision. Both groups received the same standard medical care from their 
chest physician, which consisted of standard monitoring and self-referral consultation if 
any symptoms worsened. 



At the beginning and end of the study, the following were assessed: 
Pulmonary function was assessed as forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory 
volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, and % FEV1 measured by a spirometer following 
the method reported by the ATS recommendations [14]. 
The subjective sensation of breathlessness was assessed using the modiﬁed Medical 
Research Council (mMRC) scale. The mMRC dyspnea scale contains ﬁve statements that 
patients rate on a scale of 0–4 reﬂecting minimal (e.g., “I only get breathless with strenuous 
exertion”) to severe symptoms (e.g., “I am too breathless to leave the house”) [15]. 
Exercise capacity was measured by a 6 min walking test and expressed as the 6 min 
walk distance (6 MWD). The test was performed by a well-trained respiratory therapist 
according to the ATS recommendations [16]. 
The level of physical activity was assessed as the number of daily steps, deﬁned as 
the average step count of seven days obtained by the pedometer. At a week before and 
after completion of the study, all subjects were asked to wear wore the pedometer for seven 
continuous days. The investigators them collected pedometer and recorded the average 
daily steps from the pedometer data. 
Quality of life status was assessed using the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and short 
form 12 (SF-12) questionnaires. The CAT questionnaire is a disease-speciﬁc quality of 
life questionnaire. It has eight items related to symptoms, energy, sleep, and activity. 
According to the CAT, the degree of impact from diseases can be classiﬁed into four 
levels: slight impact (score 0–10), medium impact (score 11–20), high impact (score 21–30), 
and very high impact (score > 30) [17]. The SF-12 questionnaire is a short version of 
the Short Form 36 questionnaire, which is a generic quality of life questionnaire and has 
been applied to both healthy populations and patients with chronic diseases. The SF-12 
questionnaire contains 12 items on two scales: physical (PCS) and mental health component 
scale (MCS) [12]. The SF-12 explains the majority of the variance (80–85%) of the SF-36. The 
outcomes range from 0 (worst conceivable QOL) to 100 (best conceivable QOL) [18]. 

The primary outcome of the study was a change in daily step count, an indicator of 
PA. The sample size was calculated based on observations from a previous study, assuming 
a mean difference in daily step count of 725 steps per day between the groups [19]. A 
sample size of 31 subjects per group would be needed, yielding an analysis power of 
80%, setting α to 0.05. The analysis was conducted using SPSS v.18 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, 
USA). The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to examine the normality of distribution. The 
results were expressed as the mean ± SD for nominal distributions and as median and 
interquartile range. (25–75 percentiles) for nonparametric distributions. Student’s t-test 
or Mann–Whitney U test was used when appropriate to examine the baseline differences 
between groups and paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to examine within- 
group differences. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.05. 

Fifty-nine consecutive eligible patients were screened from March 2018 to March 2019 
(Figure 1). Fourteen patients were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria 
(n = 14). Thus, 45 subjects were randomized into both the pedometer group (PG, n = 21) and 
control group (CG, n = 24). During the study period, six subjects in the PG and 13 subjects 
in the CG dropped out of the study due to comorbidities (musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, 
and the common cold) or lack of motivation, leaving 15 subjects in the PG and 11 subjects 
in the CG for analysis (Figure 1). 


Table 1 presents a summary of the demographic and clinical characteristics of the par- 
ticipants. No signiﬁcant differences existed between the groups in terms of age (73.5 ± 8.2 
vs. 71.9 ± 11.1 years, p = 0.678), and BMI (0.2 ± 4.4 vs. 1.0 ± 2.3 kg/m2, p = 0.443). The 
majority of subjects in both groups were diagnosed with COPD GOLD stage II (53.3% in 
PG and 63.6% in CG). There were no signiﬁcant differences in the baseline characteristics 
between the PG and CG except the % of predicted 6 min walking distance. 
In the PG, there was a signiﬁcant improvement in pulmonary function, daily steps, 
dyspnea scale, and quality of life at the end of the study. The predicted % of FVC sig- 
niﬁcantly increased from 81.0 ± 14.3% to 90.6 ± 23.4% (p = 0.021) (Table 2). The daily 
steps increased from 4768.4 ± 2643.3 steps to 7042.7 ± 4281.9 steps (p = 0.01) (Figure 2A). 
Post-CAT scores (11.5 ± 7.5) were signiﬁcantly lower than those in the pre-CAT scores 
(14.9 ± 8.8) (Figure 2B). In the control group, there were no signiﬁcant differences in the 
measurement of pulmonary function, 6 min walking distance, dyspnea scale, and quality 
of life score between pre-and post-measurements. The number of daily steps decreased 
from 4468.08 ± 3783.9 steps to 4385.1 ± 3692.6 steps (p > 0.05) (Figure 2A). 














 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After the study, subjects in the PG showed a signiﬁcant improvement in the daily steps 
(2274.3 ± 3014.2 steps) compared with those in the CG (−83.68 ± 923.30 steps) (p = 0.011) 
(Table 3). There was also a signiﬁcant difference in the changes in CAT scores between the 
PG (−4.80 ± 6.6) and CG (1.55 ± 6.5) (p = 0.022) (Table 3). No signiﬁcant difference was 
found in the changes in pulmonary function, 6 min walking distance, and dyspnea scale 
between the PG and CG at the end of the study (Table 3).

The relationship between changes in the parameters is presented in Table 4. Changes 
in daily steps were signiﬁcantly correlated with changes in the MRC scale (r = 0.385, 
p = 0.047) and CAT scores (r = 0.505, p = 0.010). A greater increase in daily steps was 
associated with greater improvement in the dyspnea scale and symptom-related quality of 
life questionnaire scores.

The main ﬁnding of this randomized controlled trial demonstrated that in patients 
with COPD, a step target using a pedometer-based home program produced a signiﬁcant 
increase in daily steps. This daily walking program also resulted in improvement of 
pulmonary function and perception of health status. However, no signiﬁcant improvement 
was observed in exercise capacity. 
In our study, subjects in the PG had signiﬁcantly increases in FVC and FVC% after 
the intervention, whereas subjects in CG showed no signiﬁcant differences (Table 2). In 
addition, although it was not statistically signiﬁcant, the changes in % predicted FEV1 
in PG showed a tendency of increase, whereas a tendency of decrease was found in CG 
(Tables 2 and 3). In a study examining the effects of a self-monitored, home-based exercise 
training program on patients with moderate COPD, subjects in the intervention group 
demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement in FEV1%, whereas subjects in the control group 
showed a tendency of decrease in FEV1% after the 3-month program [20]. A meta-analysis 
of 21 randomized, controlled trials reported that exercise training was associated with a 
small but signiﬁcant increase in spirometry results (e.g., FEV1, FVC) [21]. During walking, 
regular and frequent body movements induce deep breathing, enhance chest expansion, 
increase pulmonary ventilation, and may result in the improvement of pulmonary function. 
The results of our study are consistent with those of a previous study that showed that 
physical activity is associated with the improvement or maintenance of lung function in 
COPD patients. 
The level of physical activity is often decreased in patients with COPD due to exertion 
dyspnea and exercise intolerance, leading to further deconditioning. In our study, the daily 
steps in the PG signiﬁcantly increased from 4768.4 ± 2643.3 steps/day to 
7042.7 ± 4281.9 steps/day after a 6-week intervention. The improvement in daily steps 
in the PG was also signiﬁcantly higher than that in the CG. Mendoza et al. evaluated 
the effects of a 3-month pedometer-based program on the level of physical activity in 
patients with COPD [22]. They found that the PG had signiﬁcantly greater improvement 
in daily steps than the patients in the control group [22]. Kawagoshi et al. demonstrated 
a signiﬁcantly higher daily walking time in COPD patients who participated in a home- 
based pedometer program than in the CG [23]. The commercialized pedometer, which 
provides immediate visual feedback, may increase subjects’ motivation and compliance to 
accomplish the set goal. With a pedometer, subjects become aware of their current number 
of steps and increase their efforts to change their behavior [24]. Our results appear to 
support previous ﬁndings which suggest the beneﬁts of pedometer-based programs on the 
improvement in the level of physical activities. 
The effects of a pedometer-based program among COPD patients have been proposed 
in previous studies. Moy et al. set the goal of daily steps to be an increase of 600 steps/week 
and reported an improvement of 447 steps/day (about 13%) after a 16-week home pro- 
gram [25]. In another study, the goal of daily steps was set to increase 15%/month in 
the experimental group and the subjects have a mean change in 1114 steps (36%) after a 
12-week intervention [26]. Compared to previous studies [25,26], our study achieved a 
higher increase of daily steps (2274 steps, about 47%) with a shorter duration (6 weeks). 
Physiological capacity is increased by physical training stimulus on a regular basis. To 
build a new adaptation, the training stimulus must be increased to maintain overload [27]. 
The prescription of the overloading dose is also essential for the improvement of capacity. 
Either too small or too high overloading dose could lead to no improvement or, even worth, 
tissue damage. In our study, the target of daily steps was set individually (an increase 
of 10% of the subject’s average daily steps from the previous week) which may be more 
precisely ﬁt patients’ capacity and lead to improvement of daily steps with better efﬁciency. 
In our study, quality of life was assessed using CAT and SF12 questionnaires. The pa- 
tients in the PG demonstrated signiﬁcant improvements in CAT scores after the intervention 
program. The changes in CAT levels in the PG were signiﬁcantly higher than those in the 
CG. In addition, an increase in the number of daily steps was associated with improvement 


in dyspnea level (mMRC scale) and quality of life (CAT scores). Widyastutia et al. reported 
that COPD patients demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement in daily steps and mMRC 
and CAT scores after six weeks of a home pedometer-based walking program [28]. In a 
study examining the effects of a pedometer-based program on COPD patients, Mendoza 
et al. found that the experimental group showed increased improvement in daily steps 
and CAT scores [22]. The results of our study are consistent with those previous studies 
and suggested that a pedometer-based program can improve the level of daily activity and 
quality of life in COPD patients. Regular and sustained participation in physical activity 
(PA) can assist in the prevention and/or slow down the progress of several chronic diseases 
in relation to both primary and secondary prevention [29]. PA improves peripheral muscle 
function in patients with COPD [28]. It also reduces the number of hospital admissions, 
which have been shown to impair QoL [30]. The results of our study were consistent with 
those of previous studies that showed that COPD patients who maintain or increase their 
levels of daily activity may break the vicious cycle of inactivity and improve their QoL. 
A pulmonary rehabilitation program that includes exercise has been recommended 
for patients with COPD to improve level of physical activity and quality of life [8]. Many 
traditional pulmonary rehabilitation programs are held in hospitals and could be difﬁcult 
for patients to access considering the transportation requirements and distance from the 
hospitals. Over the last two years, the world has been consumed by the COVID-19 pan- 
demic. Despite great efforts to control the pandemic, the infection rates are still high and 
the healthcare system face enormous challenge around the world. Barriers for patients with 
COPD to effective pulmonary rehabilitation existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and 
were exacerbated by the pandemic because of the need for social distancing, widespread 
lockdowns, and overload on health care systems. The pedometer-based program in our 
study can be followed at home and thus may lower the risk of contagion during the trans- 
portation to hospital. This program may be considered to be an alternative program for 
patients to maintain their physical function during epidemic conditions. 
In a previous study, COPD patients with a mean disease severity of GOLD level 
2.2 demonstrated signiﬁcant improvement in 6 min walking distance (6 MWD) from 
404 ± 148 m to 467 ± 157 m after participating in a walking program with a pedometer for 
feedback [23]. However, in our study, no signiﬁcant changes in 6 MWD (450.5 ± 102.4 m 
vs. 450.0 ± 108.4 m) were found after the intervention program in the PG. This could be 
due to the ceiling effect as the majority of subjects were classiﬁed as GOLD II. Spruit et al. 
performed 6 min walking test for thousands of COPD patients and reported that the mean 
6 MWD was 409 ± 112 m [31]. In our study, the mean 6 MWD of the PG at baseline 
was 450.5 ± 102.4 m, which was much higher than that in the previous study. The % of 
predicted 6 MWD at baseline (115.2 ± 25.9%) was already over 100% in the PG, which may 
result in the ceiling effect and thus may not be able to gain additional improvement in the 
performance of 6 min walking test. 

This study had several limitations. First, the self-efﬁcacy of the subjects in this study 
was not evaluated. Second, subjects were not blinded to their group, which may have 
inﬂuenced the motivation of the subjects in the CG. However, both groups received the 
same amount of face-to-face contact, meaning that differences between groups were not 
due to different levels of input from health professionals but rather were related to the 
speciﬁc nature of the intervention. Third, the small sample size and high number of drop 
off in our study may have affected the statistical power of detecting the differences of the 
results. The small sample size may also limit the representative ability of COPD. Further 
studies with larger sample sizes should be carried out. 

In conclusion, the study ﬁndings indicate that the pedometer-based, step target home 
program enhances the quality of life and the level of physical activity by increasing daily 


steps in patients with COPD. These novel data provide signiﬁcant insights for developing 
an appropriate home rehabilitation program for COPD patients by healthcare providers 
with the assistance of commercial devices such as pedometers. Overall, our results support 
the use of speciﬁc programs that include the use of monitoring devices and goal setting to 
promote positive outcomes in patients with COPD.
