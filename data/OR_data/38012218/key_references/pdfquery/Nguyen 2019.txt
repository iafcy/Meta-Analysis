Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United 
States.1 Observational studies2-8 consistently show that physical inactivity is associated with 
increased hospitalizations and death. Moreover, it has previously been shown that hospitalized 
patients with COPD who engaged in physical activity (PA) before the index admission had a 34% 
lower risk of 30-day readmission compared with inactive patients.9 

centered outcomes,10,11 participation remains dismal at approximately 5%12,13 due to persistent 
barriers.14,15 Health systems need alternative approaches to achieve more patient-centered care, 
with better outcomes at lower cost, for the majority of patients who are not able to participate in PR, 
especially in light of current national PA guidelines16 and continued pressure to reduce 
readmissions.17 Small studies18-24 of PA interventions showed positive short-term to medium-term 
improvements in PA. The real-world and long-term effectiveness of interventions to increase PA and 





sample of patients with a history of COPD exacerbations. The WO intervention was designed based 
on learnings from a series of collective studies24-27 by members of the investigative team that were 
informed by early and deep engagement with patient stakeholders and was grounded in social 
cognitive28 and self-regulation29,30 theories and core principles of motivational interviewing.31 We 
hypothesized that the WO intervention would increase PA and consequently reduce future acute 


Study Design and Setting 
This pragmatic randomized clinical trial compared the effectiveness of a 12-month PA intervention 

patients who were randomized to the WO intervention. The research question, design, and methods 
are aligned with methodological standards for pragmatic trials.32,33 This study was approved by the 
Kaiser Permanente Southern California Institutional Review Board. The study took place at 8 medical 








Study Population 
English-speaking and Spanish-speaking patients with a COPD-related hospitalization, emergency 


data showed that they had the following characteristics: they were younger than 40 years; they had 
a forced expiratory volume/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio exceeding 0.70; they were 
discharged to hospice or to another acute, postacute, or long-term care facility; they were 






Randomization 
A total of 2707 eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to the WO intervention or SC, stratified by 
medical center, time from COPD acute care event (<6 vs (cid:2)6 months), self-reported PA obtained from 
the exercise vital sign34 (inactive vs active), and median age (<72 vs (cid:2)72 years) by random permuted 
block randomization. Patients randomized to WO received a recruitment letter and study brochure 

existing clinical staff (respiratory therapists who served as the PA coaches) to assess their interest in 
WO. Following a single-consent, encouragement design,35,36 only those assigned to WO were 
approached for written consent to participate in intervention activities. Therefore, 2 groups were 

not contacted about the study except for a random subgroup who were invited to complete surveys 
during 12 months. Detailed study methods and implementation learnings have been published.37,38 
The trial protocol, including the scientific rationale for the study design, is available in Supplement 1. 
Study Interventions 
The WO intervention included collaborative monitoring of PA step counts, semiautomated step goal 



patients with COPD engage in are ambulatory in nature and walking is a safe and accessible form 
of PA.39 




















Comparison Group 
The SC patients continued to receive their routine care and had access to all health services in 



Study Outcomes 
The primary outcome was a composite binary measure of any all-cause hospitalizations, observation 

care use, cardiometabolic markers (blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, and lipids), and self- 
reported PA.34 Follow-up time was 12 months from the date of randomization. These outcomes were 
available for all patients from the EMRs. Additional secondary outcomes included the following: 
symptoms (COPD Assessment Test),40 depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 8),41 anxiety 
(Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7),42 health-related quality of life (Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System 10 [PROMIS-10]),43 and satisfaction with the program for a subset 
of the sample. These data were obtained from mailed surveys for all WO participants and a randomly 

Sample Size and Statistical Analysis 
Sample size was calculated based on estimates of acute care use and death from previous 
studies9,44-46 and with the assumption that approximately 50% of the patients assigned to WO 
would participate in the intervention. Allowing for a 15% disenrollment from the health plan and 




















on primary outcomes after randomization. For the as-treated analysis, stabilized (standardized 
difference, <0.1) propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting47 was used to balance 
baseline characteristics between patients who participated in WO and the SC group. The propensity 













Patient Flow and Baseline Characteristics 
A total of 2707 patients (baseline mean [SD] age, 72 [10] years; 53.7% female; 74.3% of white race/ 
ethnicity; and baseline mean [SD] forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration (FEV1%) 
predicted, 61.0 [22.5]) were identified from the EMRs and randomized to WO (n = 1358) or SC 










WO Intervention Process Measures, PA, and Satisfaction 
Approximately 83.3% (264 of 317) of WO participants completed at least 4 reinforcement telephone 










Step counts from any of the 3 activity sensors during 12 months showed that participants with 
higher step counts at baseline ((cid:2)5000 steps per day) tended to decline, whereas those with lower 
step counts at baseline (<5000 steps per day) remained steady (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). 





Primary ITT Findings for Acute Care Use and Death 
For all randomized patients, there was no significant difference in the primary composite outcome of

The null results from our ITT analyses are not very different from those of 2 recent, 
multicomponent COPD self-management studies.48,49 While both studies showed short-term 
reductions in COPD-related hospitalizations and/or emergency department visits at 6 months, 
neither showed a persistent effect at 12 months. Moreover, neither intervention had a significant 
influence on all-cause hospitalizations or death at 6 or 12 months. These 2 studies48,49 also differed 
from our study in several ways. Our study was focused on increasing PA and prioritizing 

previous 12 months, with few exclusions, relying solely on EMR data without performing medical 
record reviews. In contrast, these 2 efficacy studies48,49 conducted extensive medical record reviews 
and screenings before recruiting patients, while they were still hospitalized, and ultimately enrolled

when contrasted with participation in PR by Medicare beneficiaries (4%) with COPD13 or among 
those who had a recent COPD hospital discharge (2.7%)12 or among patients exposed to lighter- 
touch no-cost behavioral programs (2%).50 Nonetheless, health systems need to weigh the 
resources associated with broad outreach efforts and the yield in patient engagement, especially in 
response to the recent PA guidelines recommending that all older adults and those with chronic 
conditions engage in some level of PA.16 When contacted, approximately 34.6% (471 of 1358) of

improvements in PA in the as-treated analyses but not in the ITT analyses. In addition, there were

An earlier observational study52 examining PA intensity and duration using accelerometer data 
found that low-intensity PA had a protective effect on risk of COPD hospitalization, with no benefit 
from high-intensity PA. In fact, for every 1000-step increase in low-intensity PA, there was a 20% risk 
reduction in COPD hospitalizations.52 In our study, although the risk estimate for the as-treated 
analysis of COPD-related acute care use was in a favorable direction, the significant finding with
