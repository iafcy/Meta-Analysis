Objective: To investigate whether a 12-week pedometer-based exercise counseling strategy is feasible 
and effectively enhances daily physical activity in outclinic Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
(COPD) patients who do not participate in a rehabilitation program in a controlled way. 
Methods: 35 outclinic COPD patients (21 males, mean age 62 years, GOLD I–III, mean FEV1% predicted 
64.7) were randomized for a 12-week individual pedometer-based exercise counseling program 
promoting daily physical activities or usual care. Daily physical activity (DigiWalker SW-200), physical 
ﬁtness, health-related quality of life, self-efﬁcacy, fatigue, depression and motivation to be physically 
active were assessed before and after the intervention. 
Results: After the intervention, COPD patients in the exercise counseling group showed a signiﬁcant 
increase in their mean number of steps/day (from 7087 to 7872), whereas the usual care group showed a 
decrease (from 7539 to 6172). Signiﬁcant differences favoring the exercise counseling group were 
demonstrated in arm strength, leg strength, health-related quality of life and intrinsic motivation to be 
physically active. 
Conclusion: Our study shows that a 12-week pedometer-based exercise counseling strategy is feasible 
and effectively enhances daily physical activity, physical ﬁtness, health-related quality of life and intrinsic 
motivation in outclinic COPD patients who do not participate in a rehabilitation program. 
Practice implications: The feasibility of our exercise counseling strategy is good and patients were 
motivated to participate. 


Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized 
by cough, phlegm, dyspnea, decreased exercise tolerance and 
exacerbations. COPD patients may enter a downward spiral of 
symptom-induced inactivity leading to lack of ﬁtness and a reduced 
quality of life. It has been demonstrated that during 1 day, COPD 
patients spend more time sitting and lying down and less standing 
and walking than age-matched healthy controls [1]. To reverse this 
vicious circle of inactivity it is important to prevent the decrease in 
daily physical activity or even to enhance it.

Enhancement of low-to-moderate-intensity daily physical activ- 
ity has proven to be effective in strengthening health-related ﬁtness 
and quality of life in healthy older adults [2,3]. Because COPD 
patients frequently suffer from ventilatory limitations and oxygen 
low-to-moderate-intensity physical activities 
uptake problems, 
seem an appropriate level to enhance their physical ﬁtness [4]. To 
monitor enhancement of daily physical activity pedometers have 
shown to be effective in healthy people as well as in various patients 
groups [5–8]. Pedometers are also key in triggering enhancement 
of daily physical activity [9–12]. In addition, exercise counseling 
has shown to be effective in tailoring the needs and circumstances 
of individual patients in the process of behavioral modiﬁcation 
[13,14]. 
In this study, we investigated whether a 12-week pedometer- 
based exercise counseling strategy is feasible and effectively en- 
hances daily physical activity in COPD patients who do not part- 
icipate in a rehabilitation program. 







Patients with stable COPD visiting the outpatient clinic of the 
pulmonary department of Wilhelmina Hospital in Assen were 
approached to participate in this study. Inclusion criteria were 
diagnosis of COPD and age between 45 and 75 years. Exclusion 
criterion was signiﬁcant comorbidity interfering with physical 
activity. The study was approved by the local medical ethical 
committee of University Medical Centre Groningen and all patients 
signed a written informed consent. 



enhance daily physical activities and to develop a more physically 
active lifestyle. Five individually tailored exercise counseling 
sessions took place during 12 weeks (Table 1). Each session lasted 
approximately 30 min. 
Patients in the usual care group received usual care and wore 
the pedometer for 2 weeks at baseline and 10 weeks after baseline. 

All statistical analyses were performed using Scientiﬁc Package 
of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 14.0. The Mann–Whitney U-test 
and the Chi-square test were used to analyze baseline character- 
istics. A factorial ANOVA (group (cid:2) time) was used to examine the 
effect of the intervention. Effect sizes were computed [32] and a 
power analysis was calculated [33]. To test the null hypothesis 
alpha was set at 0.05 and beta at 0.80. 







- Physical ﬁtness: leg strength was measured by the chair-stand- 
test [16,17], arm strength by the arm-curl-test [16,17], grip force 
by a handheld dynamometer and cardiorespiratory endurance by 
the 6-min walking test [18]. 
- Health-related quality of life was measured by the Clinical COPD 
Questionnaire and the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire 
[19,20]. Health status was measured by the SF-36 [21]. 
- Fatigue was measured by the Dutch Exertion Fatigue Scale [22]. 
- Depression was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory [23]. 
- Self-efﬁcacy was measured by the LIVAS [24,25]. 
- Motivation to be physically active was measured by the Exercise 


Patients were randomly assigned to an exercise counseling or a 
usual care group. The exercise counseling group participated in a 
12-week customized exercise counseling program designed to 
enhance daily physical activity in COPD patients [26]. Patients 
started the program in the late summer and ﬁnished it in the early 
winter. The exercise counseling program was given by a trained 
exercise counselor (the ﬁrst author) and is predominantly based on 
the principles of goal setting and implementation of goals [27]. 
Motivational interviewing technique [28] is used as counseling 
technique. A pedometer, worn all day during the intervention 
period, was used to monitor and support motivation to participate. 
Aim of the exercise counseling was to motivate COPD patients to 
Table 1 
Exercise counseling sessions. 

The exercise counseling group increased its mean number of 
steps/day by 11% (Table 3). By contrast, the usual care group 
showed a decrease in their mean steps/day of 18%. In the exercise 
counseling group about 56% of the participants showed an 
increase, while in the usual care group 29% showed an increase 
in mean number of steps/day. This difference was signiﬁcant. 

The exercise counseling group, as compared to the usual care 
group, showed a beneﬁcial signiﬁcant effect on leg strength and 
arm strength (Table 3). Moreover, a signiﬁcant improvement was 
found on quality of life and changes in intrinsic motivation score. 
No signiﬁcant differences were found for fatigue, health status, 
depression and self-efﬁcacy. Controlled for number of steps/day at 
baseline, the results of a factorial ANOVA showed a signiﬁcant 
increase in only leg strength in the exercise counseling group 
compared to the usual care group.

physical activity, physical ﬁtness, health-related quality of life and 
intrinsic motivation in COPD patients who do not participate in a 
rehabilitation program. 
COPD patients in the exercise counseling group increased their 
number of steps by 11%. COPD patients who took less than 10,000 
steps/day at baseline increased their number of steps by about 
19%. This corresponds with about 20 min walking per day. Still, a 
mean number of 6124 steps post-program is far below the 
arbitrary cut-off point of 10,000 steps/day for healthy adults. For 
physically active COPD patients (>10,000 steps/day at baseline) 
who participated in the exercise counseling group the number of 
steps did consolidate. Contrary, physically active participants in 
the usual care group demonstrated a dramatic fall in number of 
steps/day by 21%. One might suggest that this dramatic fall is due 
to a seasonal effect [34,35]. Patients started the program in the late 
summer and ﬁnished it in the early winter. It is conceivable that

physically active COPD patients reduce their outside physical 
activities in the early winter because of bad weather. 
The increase in daily physical activity level of COPD patients in 
the exercise counseling group is supported by a systematic review 
study of Bravata et al. [14], who show pedometer users signiﬁcantly 
increased their physical activity by 2491 more steps/day than 
control participants (95% conﬁdence interval 1098–3885 steps/day, 
P = .001). In our study the difference between the exercise coun- 
seling and usual care group is 2152 steps/day. 
Sedentary COPD patients in the exercise counseling group show 
signiﬁcant improvement of leg strength and arm strength. Appar- 
ently, enhancing daily activities provide an adequate training 
stimulus, at least in COPD patients with a decreased active lifestyle. 
The 6-min walking test improved by 26 m in the exercise counseling 
group, compared to 10 m in the usual care group. Both changes are 
below the minimal clinically relevant change. Nevertheless, we 
hypothesize that for the exercise counseling group the 6-min 
walking test will further improve if patients stick to their new 
lifestyle. 
The question arises whether pedometer-based counseling 
programs should be used as an alternative to regular pulmonary 
rehabilitation programs, especially for COPD patients who cannot 
beneﬁt from regular pulmonary rehabilitation due to budgetary 
restrictions. In our opinion, the beneﬁts of an exercise counseling 
strategy are evident: it is our experience, also in other settings, that 
patients can incorporate the daily physical activities into their 
regular life; and different caregivers can be trained to give exercise 
counseling. Nevertheless, we realize that speciﬁc COPD patients, 
like those severely deconditioned, really need the multidis- 
ciplinary approach of a pulmonary rehabilitation program. We 
previously published a study in which we enhanced daily physical 
activity in COPD patients in pulmonary rehabilitation, using the 
same exercise counseling strategy. We showed that our exercise 
counseling strategy was feasible next to pulmonary rehabilitation

increase in daily physical activity and leg strength are amenities of 
this study. Limitation of the study is the lack of long-term follow-up.
