Abstract 
Background and objective: There are barriers to providing pulmonary rehabilitation for chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) such as the high number of patients, difﬁcult access to 
health facilities and high costs of programs. Pedometers can monitor and improve physical 
activity (PA). The aim of this study was to evaluate beneﬁts and costs of home pedometer 
assisted PA, as compared to a standard outpatient supervised exercise training program in 
patients with COPD. 
Methods: Patients were randomly assigned either to home pedometer assisted PA (Group 1), 
or to a six-week outpatient standard supervised exercise training program (Group 2). Patients 
of Group 1 had to walk at home for 6 weeks, at least 30 min daily at the fastest step pace as 
possible, to achieve a weekly 10% increase in their average daily steps up to more than 6500. 
Pre and post programs we assessed: the six minute walking distance (6MWT: primary outcome), 
daily steps count, the Medical Research Council scale (MRC), the COPD assessment test score, 
and the BODE index (body-mass index, airﬂow obstruction, dyspnea, exercise capacity). Costs 
of programs were also evaluated.

Results: Out of 40 patients, 18 in both groups (mean (standard deviation)) age: 68.3 (6.7) and 
61.2 (6.7) years; FEV1: 1.1 (0.5) and 0.9 (0.4) liters in Group 1 and 2 respectively completed the 
study. At the end of the program 44.5% patients of Group 1 had reached the target daily steps, 
in 26.6 (9.5) days. Following the programs, both groups showed signiﬁcant improvements in all 
outcome measures, except BODE. The home program was cheaper (p = 0.0001), with a mean 
76.3 euros saving per patient. 
Conclusion: Home pedometer assisted PA may be a useful and cheaper alternative to outpatient 
supervised exercise training programs in patients with COPD.

Total tobacco-attributable deaths including those due to 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a leading 
cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide are projected to 
rise from 5.4 million in 2005 to 8.3 million in 2030.1---4 Preva- 
lence and mortality rate are forecasted to increase due to 
the increasing number of smokers.2---6 
Higher physical activity (PA) is associated with lower 
risk of mortality and cardiovascular events in individuals 
from low-, middle-, and high-income countries.7 Daily PA of 
patients with COPD is reduced in the early phases of disease 
as compared to healthy age-matched controls8 and worsen 
over time, with important clinical consequences.9 In these 
patients pulmonary rehabilitation improves symptoms, exer- 
cise capacity and health-related quality of life (HRQL),10,11 
although the observed beneﬁts do not consistently translate 
into enhanced PA levels.12 As a consequence guidelines for 
management of COPD suggest that pulmonary rehabilitation 
including exercise training should be provided to the vast 
majority of patients.1 
In many countries, there are barriers to hospital based 
inpatient and outpatient supervised exercise training pro- 
grams, such as a high number of patients, transportation, 
program costs, and geographical obstacles.13 A home pro- 
gram consisting of 3 weekly sessions for 8 weeks of aerobic 
leg cycling and strength exercises was a useful, equivalent 
alternative to outpatient rehabilitation for patients with 
COPD.14 Also tele-rehabilitation programs may be poten- 
tially useful to deliver and to maintain the beneﬁts 
in 
difﬁcult-to-reach areas.15,16 
The daily steps and activity time were proven to be the 
most valid measurement of PA17,18 and their regular mon- 
itoring may beneﬁt patients with COPD in achieving the 
effective daily PA.18 Pedometers have greatly advanced in 
recent years, providing daily step estimates,18 and smart- 
phones with miniaturized accelerometre apps measuring PA 
are universal, widespread technologies which many patients 
with COPD may not use as they probably should. 
We hypothesized that a home pedometer assisted pro- 
gram to incentivize PA might be an alternative to hospital 
based outpatient exercise training programs, especially in 
the context of regional asymmetries and difﬁcult access to 
health facilities (as is the case of Indonesia with a 4.5% COPD 
prevalence,5 and a population of about 260 million --- about 
35 million living in Central Jawa, the others living on more 
than 17 000 islands with limited access to health services19). 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on exercise 
capacity, PA, dyspnea, and health status as well as costs of 
home pedometer assisted PA, as compared to a standard 
outpatient supervised exercise training program in patients 
with COPD. 


This was a randomized clinical trial (RCT). During the ﬁrst 
week, all patients were taught how to use pedometers 
in three face to face sessions with a researcher checking 
patients’ ability to use the device properly. After the train- 
ing week, subjects were randomly assigned to two groups: 
the Study Group (Group 1) received an unsupervised home 
pedometer assisted PA program, the Control Group (Group 
2) received a hospital based outpatient supervised exer- 
cise training program. Researchers evaluating results and 
patients were not blind to treatment. Patients maintained 
their usual drug medication during the entire study. 
The study was performed according to the Helsinki 
Declaration and approved by the Ethics Committee of 
Dr. Moewardi Hospital, Surakarta, Central Jawa, Indonesia 
(Reference: 799/IX/HREC/2016). Written informed consent 
to participate was obtained from all participants. 

Stable patients suffering from COPD as deﬁned by the 
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
(GOLD) guidelines,1 40---75 years old, were consecutively 
recruited from the outpatient clinic of Dr. Moewardi Hos- 
pital, Surakarta, Central Jawa, Indonesia, between October 
2016 and January 2017. Patients were enrolled if in a stable 
clinical condition (no exacerbation in the 4 weeks prior to 
study). The exclusion criteria were refusal to participate, 
participation in a pulmonary rehabilitation program during 
the previous 6 months, and severe concomitant comorbidi- 
ties such as ischemic cardiac disease, chronic heart failure, 
orthopedic and/or neuromuscular diseases interfering with 
their ability to walk.

MCID for PA has been reported to be 600---1100 daily 
steps.22 
 The subjective sensation of breathlessness was evaluated 
by means of the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale.23 
One point change in the scale is considered the MCID for 
this outcome measure.24 
 The perceived health status was assessed by the Indone- 
sian Version of the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score.25,26 
The MCID for CAT score is reported to be 2 points.27 
 The composite and multidimensional BODE (body-mass 
index, airﬂow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capac- 
ity) index was calculated for each patient.28 It has been 
shown that for every point increase in the BODE there is 
a corresponding increase in mortality.29 

Costs of programs per patient were assessed according to 
a modiﬁed calculation proposed by Goldstein et al.30 and 
gathered from the hospital ﬁnancial department staff. The 
following costs were identiﬁed: pedometer, doctor consulta- 
tions and doctor/nurse supervisions during exercise training, 
services, and medication. Transportation costs of patients 
and professionals to and from the hospital were calculated 
as follows: bus ticket cost, multiplied by the number of 
patients’ hospital and professionals’ home visits. Costs of 
exacerbations, hospital admissions and unscheduled medical 
visits were not included. 

The primary outcome measure was the 6MWT. Results are 
shown as mean (Standard Deviation: SD) for continuous and 
as numbers (percentage frequency) for discrete variables. 
MRC and BODE are shown as median (interquartile range), 
whereas the number of steps are presented as mean (SD) as 
normally distributed. 
To determine the sample size, an earlier study31 showed 
a post-program 70.4 (18.3) meter mean increase in 6MWT. 
The study hypothesis was therefore to observe a 30 m post- 
PRP change in both groups. To obtain a 90% study power and 
an alpha error less than 5%, a minimum sample size of 12 
patients completing the study was required in each Group. 
To obtain this result we estimated an allocation sample size 
of 40 patients, considering a 20% drop out rate. 
Unpaired t test, Kruskall---Wallis H test, and 
(cid:2)2 analyses 
for dichotomous variables were used when appropriate for 
comparison between groups to test any baseline difference. 
The two-way repeated measures ANOVA was carried out to 
compare the improvements of both groups. Chi-square test 
was used to compare continuous and categorical variables. 
A p value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically sig- 
niﬁcant. 




Patients of Group 1 received a pedometer (Omron HJ 321, 
Omron Healthcare Co Ltd, Kyoto, Japan) with the task of 
walking at home for 6 weeks. They were instructed to record 
the number of daily steps in their activity log books, along 
with information on any change in their clinical conditions. 
They were also asked to walk at home at the fastest step 
pace as possible, for at least 30 min every day, for up to 6 
weeks, with the task of achieving a weekly 10% increase in 
their average daily steps eventually reaching more than 6500 
daily steps. Doctors checked both the patients’ pedometers 
and activity logbooks during weekly meetings at patients’ 
homes and every two weeks during the meetings at outpa- 
tient clinic. On the basis of pedometer daily step count and 
activity logbook checks, doctors prescribed the target step 
count for the following week. 
Group 2 patients received three 30-min weekly sessions 
for six weeks of supervised standard exercise training on a 
treadmill at outpatient clinics. Doctors and nurses super- 
vised the sessions. Initial treadmill speed was set at 80% 
of their theoretical speed during the six minute walking test 
(6MWT) performed at admission and calculated as described 
below, at 0 inclination. Depending on patient tolerance, the 
treadmill speed could be increased by 0.1 km/h at each 
session. Patients were also encouraged to be more active 
at home and to walk for at least 30 min daily without any 
supervision. They also were instructed to ﬁll in their activity 
log books which were checked by doctors every week. Also 
these patients were given a pedometer on the day before 
the ﬁrst session and the day after the last session in order 
to record the daily steps. 

At admission the following data and measurements were 
recorded: 




 Dynamic lung volumes, assessed after bronchodilation and 
expressed as absolute and percent of predicted values 
according to the Pneumomobile Project Indonesia.20 


Exercise tolerance by means of the 6MWT.21 The best of 
two consecutive performances (2-h apart) conducted in 
a 30-m long and 3-m wide corridor under quiet condi- 
tions and without distractive stimuli was recorded for 
analysis. The Minimum Clinically Important Difference 
(MCID) of 6MWT following exercise training in moder- 
ate to severe COPD was recently reported to be at least 
a 30 m increase.21 The distance walked in 6MWT was 
also expressed as ‘‘theoretical’’ speed (km/h) multiplying 
meters 



 Physical activity was measured as daily steps, based on 
an average step count of 7 days obtained using the same 
pedometer given to patients at their baseline visit. The 
Fig. 1 shows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting 
Tables (CONSORT) diagram of the study. Out of 40 patients

recruited, 18 patients in each group completed the study. 
Two patients were excluded due to an exacerbation, one 
patient withdrew his consent, and one patient dropped out 
due to a motorcycle crash. 
Table 1 shows the demographic, anthropometric, physio- 
logical and clinical characteristics of the patients. The two 
groups were not different for any characteristic except for 
the older age in Group 1 patients. 

Table 2 shows the absolute values of the outcome measures 
before and after the programs. At the end of the program 
44.5% patients of group 1 had reached the target daily steps, 
in 26.6 (9.5) days. Two-way ANOVA showed that following the 
programs both groups reported signiﬁcant improvements in 
all measures except BODE. 
Table 3 shows the proportion of patients reaching the 
MCID in the post PRP evaluation. There was a signiﬁcant 
difference in proportion of patients reaching the MCID only 
for the BODE and MRC which were more in Group 2 than in 
Group 1. The proportion of patients reaching the MCID in all 
outcome measures was greater than 60% only in Group 2. 

Table 4 shows the detailed costs of programs per individ- 
ual patient. Despite the pedometer cost, the home program 
was cheaper with a mean 76.3 euros saving per patient. 
The median (interquartile range) for grand total cost was 
932 000 (36 000) Indonesian Rupias (IDR) or 58.2 (2.2) euros 
versus 2 124 000 for (108 000) IDR or 132.7 (6.7) euros for 
Group 1 and 2 respectively (p = 0.0001). The difference was 
mainly due to the sessions involving professionals, the costs 
of doctors consultations and doctors/nurse supervisions of 
outpatient exercise training, and the costs of daily trans- 
portations of patients to and from the hospital required by 
Group 2 patients. 

A home pedometer assisted program to incentivize PA was 
cheaper than and as effective as a standard outpatient 
supervised exercise training program. 
The baseline daily step count and 6MWT of our patients 
were lower than in other studies. In the study by Vorrink 
et al.,32 the mean daily step count and 6MWT in their inter- 
vention group were 5824 steps and 465 m as compared to 
2513 steps and 193 m respectively, in our study. However 
the airway obstruction of our patients was more severe as 
shown by a mean FEV1 of 1.1 in our patients as compared to 
1.7 l in that study.32 
Our results showed signiﬁcant improvements in 6MWT 
and daily steps in both groups. However the mean improve- 
ment 
in 6MWT of Group 2 was slightly greater, albeit 
nonsigniﬁcantly, than in Group 1, whereas the change in 
daily steps was similar in both groups. This difference indi- 
cates the need to speciﬁcally assess both exercise capacity 
and PA, when evaluating the effects of pulmonary rehabili- 
tation. Our results are similar to those of Mendoza et al.33: 
in that randomized study patients with COPD underwent 
either a standard program of PA encouragement alone, or a 
pedometer-based program. Their pedometer group gained 
signiﬁcant improvements in PA (by 3080 daily steps) and CAT 
score (−3.5), similar to our results, and in 6MWT (by 12.4 m), 
less than in our patients.33 An earlier study in Indonesian

COPD patients31 showed after a 5-week program a mean 44 m 
increase in 6MWT, a result similar to that observed in Group 
1 of our study. The post-program improvement in exercise 
tolerance and in PA observed in our study translated into an 
improvement in health status as assessed by the CAT score 
and dyspnea as assessed by MRC in both groups. Previous 
studies found that MRC, due to its limited number of lev- 
els, was not sensitive enough to detect small changes after 
programs.34 
In our study the perceived health status was assessed 
by the CAT score. A speciﬁc HRQL questionnaire such as 
the Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) was not 
available at our Institution. Although CAT is correlated to 
SGRQ in terms of discriminating health status, there is evi- 
dence that the SGRQ shows a greater responsiveness in 
patients with COPD undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation.35 
The main ﬁndings of our study suggest that indepen- 
dently of the setting, whether home pedometer assisted 
or standard outpatient program, our COPD patients gained 
similar mean improvements in assessed outcome measures, 
except the BODE index. However, from a clinical point of 
view, it is important to note that the proportion of patients 
reaching the MCID in all outcome measures was greater than 
60% only in Group 2. Other studies have reported conﬂicting 
results. A 6-week online-supported pulmonary rehabilitation 
program was non-inferior to a conventional program in terms 
of effects on 6MWT, and symptom scores; furthermore it was 
safe and well tolerated.36 A home maintenance pulmonary 
rehabilitation program was equally as effective as an out- 
patient hospital, maintenance program in reducing the risk 
for acute COPD exacerbations and hospitalizations.16 Physi- 
cal activity could be signiﬁcantly increased in patients with 
COPD using a 12-week intervention including a step counter 
and a smartphone app.37 A home pulmonary rehabilitation 
program, delivered with minimal resources, produced short- 
term clinical outcomes similar to a center-based program.38 
A recent simulation study39 has reported that pulmonary 
rehabilitation was cost-effective in every setting in the 
comprehensive management of patients with COPD. In the 
programs of our study as a whole the cost per patient of 
Group 1 was about half than that of Group 2. In the frame of 
Indonesian economy the mean 76.3 euros saving per patient 
obtained in Group 1, is not negligible. The cost analysis in 
our study involved direct costs and transportation as the only 
indirect cost. We were unable to calculate other indirect 
costs, such as time spent by relatives to transport patients 
to and from the hospital, or costs of exacerbations, hospital 
admissions or unscheduled visits. Previous studies reported 
a reduction in health service usage in rehabilitated outpa- 
tients. Grifﬁths et al.,40 reported that outpatient pulmonary 
rehabilitation produced cost per quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs) ratios within bounds considered to be cost effec- 
tive. In a retrospective case-control study,41 a short-term, 
inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program induced a short- 
term improvement in exercise tolerance, similar to a longer, 
outpatient program. The duration of program and the need 

+Model 
PULMOE-16; No. of Pages 8 



for daily transportation signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the total 
costs of the outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation.41 In a RCT 
including an economic evaluation, outpatient pulmonary 
rehabilitation appeared highly cost-effective in comparison 
with a program incorporating a substantial period of inpa- 
tient care.30,42 Comparisons of cost-effectiveness between 
programs performed in different countries, institutions and 
health-care systems are difﬁcult because of differences in 
case-mix, outcome measures, and the time-points when 
outcomes are measured. Therefore, the application of our 
results to other health-care systems must be considered with 
caution. 
Our study has some limitations. We have compared home 
pedometer assisted PA with outpatient supervised exercise 
training. Stimulated PA and supervised exercise training are 
only two of the components of pulmonary rehabilitation 
which, according to the ATS/ERS statement,10 should also 
include other multidisciplinary interventions such as educa- 
tion, and behavior change. Whether a more comprehensive 
intervention also including other components as deﬁned 
by that statement10 would have obtained different results, 
remain to be evaluated. We have also compared two groups 
performing a different number of exercise sessions. On the 
other hand our results may indicate also the effectiveness 
of our supervised hospital based outpatient program achiev- 
ing the same beneﬁts as an unsupervised program despite 
less exercise sessions. The use of pedometers by the home 
program might have introduced some bias to the study, as 
standard hospital based programs do not routinely offer this 
device. Patients and researchers were not blind to alloca- 
tion. However, this bias probably would have favored results 
of Group 1 which in fact did not show any superiority over 
Group 2. 
In conclusion with these limitations this preliminary RCT 
showed that, at least in our health-care system and for our 
patients with COPD, a home pedometer assisted program to 
incentivize PA may be a useful and cheaper alternative to 
outpatient supervised exercise training programs.
