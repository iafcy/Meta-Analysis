Summary 
Background: We were interested in the effects of a physical activity (PA) counselling pro- 
gramme in three groups of COPD patients from general practice (primary care), outpatient 
clinic (secondary care) and pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). 
Methods: In this randomized controlled trial 155 COPD patients, 102 males, median (IQR) age 
62 (54e69) y, FEV1predicted 60 (40e75) % were assigned to a 12-weeks’ physical activity coun- 
selling programme or usual care. Physical activity (pedometer (Yamax SW200) and metabolic 
equivalents), exercise capacity (6-min walking distance) and quality of life (Chronic Respira- 
tory Questionnaire and Clinical COPD Questionnaire) were assessed at baseline, after three 
and 15 months. 
Results: A signiﬁcant difference between the counselling and usual care group in daily steps 
(803 steps, p Z 0.001) and daily physical activity (2214 steps þ equivalents, p Z 0.001)) from 
0 to 3 months was found in the total group, as well as in the outpatient (1816 steps, 2616 
steps þ equivalents, both p Z 0.007) and PR (758 steps, 2151 steps þ equivalents, both 
p Z 0.03) subgroups. From 0 to 15 months no differences were found in physical activity. How- 
ever, when patients with baseline physical activity>10,000 steps per day (n Z 8), who are

already sufﬁciently active, were excluded, a signiﬁcant long-term effect of the counselling 
programme on daily physical activity existed in the total group (p Z 0.02). Differences in ex- 
ercise capacity and quality of life were found only from 0 to 3 months, in the outpatient sub- 
group. 
Conclusion: Our PA counselling programme effectively enhances PA level in COPD patients af- 
ter three months. Sedentary patients at baseline still beneﬁt after 15 months. 



Patients with COPD in general show a less active lifestyle 
than healthy subjects [1e6] which is already present in mild 
disease [7]. Low physical activity levels are clinically rele- 
vant in COPD as they are associated with lower quality of 
life [3], more frequent hospitalisations and higher mortality 
[8]. A downward circle of dyspnoea induced physical inac- 
tivity and deconditioning is thought to be responsible for 
developing psychosocial problems such as depression and 
social isolation [9]. Up to now, several strategies have been 
proposed to increase physical activity in COPD, such as 
exercise training alone or in combination with a self man- 
agement programme [10,11]. An alternative strategy to 
improve physical activity levels might be to aim at 
enhancing lifestyle physical activity instead of focussing on 
exercise training. 
The intensity level of lifestyle physical activities, such 
as walking, gardening and housekeeping in general 
is 
moderate, which makes it attractive for patients with 
COPD with reduced ventilatory capacity, because vigorous 
intensity often causes feelings of dyspnoea and muscle 
fatigue. In this respect lifestyle physical activity is well 
assessed using pedometers or more sophisticated activity 
monitors, which can even be used as an intervention tool 
for increasing daily physical activity, showing positive re- 
sults at least in patients with diabetes type II [12e15]. 
Inspired by these studies, we developed a pedometer- 
based physical activity counselling programme using 
cognitive behavioural strategies [16], aiming at enhance- 
ment and incorporation of physical activities of moderate 
intensity in daily life. The counselling programme has been 
studied in two pilot studies in two different COPD pop- 
ulations, namely patients from the outpatient clinic [17] 
and patients following PR [18], and suggested an increase 
in physical activity after 3 months in the counselling group 
compared to usual care. 
Our hypothesis for the current study is that the coun- 
selling programme will result in an increase in physical 
activity in COPD patients, in the short as well as long term. 
This hypothesis was tested in three groups of COPD pa- 
tients: patients from general practices (primary care), 
outpatient clinics (secondary care), and patients following 
a PR programme. In the last group, the counselling pro- 
gramme was additional to the conventional pulmonary 
rehabilitation programme. 


The study design was randomized and controlled, as pa- 
tients were assigned to a physical activity counselling pro- 
gramme or usual care. Randomization was computerized 
and patients were allocated to counselling or usual care 
group in a 1:1 ratio, with minimization for age (<60/(cid:2)60 
years), FEV1 (<50/(cid:2)50% predicted) and sex (male/female). 
Allocation was open to the researcher, counsellor and pa- 
tient. Patients were recruited from general practices (pri- 
mary care), outpatient hospital clinics (secondary care) and 
a pulmonary rehabilitation centre (PR), all 
in the 
Netherlands, from 2007 till 2009. The last follow-up mea- 
surement was performed in December 2010. The study was 
approved by the medical ethical committee of the Univer- 
sity Medical Center Groningen and all participating patients 
signed a written informed consent form. The trial was 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov: 
registration number 
NCT00614796. 

Inclusion criteria were COPD according to the GOLD 
Guidelines and age between 40 and 80 years. Excluded 
were patients with comorbidities which severely limited 
physical activity, such as severe orthopaedic or neurolog- 
ical disorders or heart failure or having exacerbations or 
respiratory tract infections within two months prior to the 
study. 

Patients in the counselling group participated in a 12- 
weeks’ customized lifestyle physical activity counselling 
programme designed to enhance physical activity in COPD 
patients, which is described in more detail elsewhere 
[17,18]. Lifestyle physical activity in our study comprised 
all activities in daily life, including leisure time, occupa- 
tional and household activity. Patients were free to choose 
type, time point and location of activity to enhance their 
physical activity level. Patients received the physical ac- 
tivity counselling programme in addition to usual care. Two 
trained exercise counsellors performed all counselling. The 


individual counselling was predominantly based on princi- 
ples of goal-setting and implementation of goals [16] and 
motivational interviewing techniques were used. Patients 
wore a pedometer all day during the intervention period, 
which was used for feedback and motivation. A diary was 
kept with steps taken and activities other than steps (e.g. 
cycling, swimming etc.) were noted as well. Patients in the 
counselling group attended 5 individual 30 min counselling 
sessions spread over 3 months. Counselling took place in 
the setting where patients were recruited. The usual care 
group received care appropriate to their health status. For 
the PR group usual care included a multidisciplinary PR 
programme, which consisted of 9 weeks of exercise 
training, 3 sessions a week, with a duration of 1e2 h per 
session. Training forms used to achieve increased exercise 
capacity were cycling, walking, swimming and sports. In 
followed educational courses and 
addition, patients 
received psychological and/or nutritional 
if 
necessary. 


All measurements took place prior to the intervention 
(baseline), at the end of the intervention (3 months after 
baseline) and 15 months after baseline. In the PR group 
baseline meant prior to the intervention and prior to PR, as 
the physical activity counselling started together with PR. 
Lung function and bio-impedance were measured at base- 
line and 15 months after baseline. 

Physical activity was assessed in all patients in daily steps 
using a pedometer (Digiwalker SW-2000, Yamax; Tokyo 
Japan) and in daily physical activity [19]. The Compendium 
of physical activities of Ainsworth et al. was used to 
calculate metabolic equivalents for cycling, (cardio)ﬁtness 
and swimming [20,21]. A step equivalent is deﬁned as the 
physical activity with the energy expenditure of one step. 
At each measurement point patients from the counselling 
as well as the usual care group wore a pedometer during 
two weeks, from waking up until going to bed, and recorded 
number of steps per day and other activities (minutes per 
day) in a diary. The mean of the last week of steps was used 
for further analysis. Data were only used when at least 5 
days of 7 were ﬁlled out. 

Spirometry was performed according to standardized 
guidelines (Jaeger MS-IOS). Fat free mass was measured 
with bioelectrical impedance analysis (Bodystat 1500) [22]. 
Patients performed a 6-min walking distance (6MWD) test to 
measure submaximal exercise capacity [23]. General health 
status was assessed by the Short Form 36 (SF-36) and dis- 
ease speciﬁc health status by the Clinical COPD Question- 
naire (CCQ) and the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire 
(CRQ) [24e26]. Fatigue was assessed by the Dutch Exertion 
and Fatigue Scale (DEFS) [27]. Anxiety and depression were 
assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS) [28]. Self-efﬁcacy was assessed by the Perceived 
Physical Ability Subscale (PPAS, Dutch version) (10 items) of 
the physical self-efﬁcacy scale [29]. Intrinsic motivation for 
physical activity was assessed by the Self Regulation 
Questionnaire for Exercise (SRQ-E) [30]. 

Characteristics are shown as median (IQR) due to non- 
normal distribution of outcome variables. Sample size cal- 
culations for this two-armed study were based on changes 
in steps found in one of our pilot studies using an increase 
of 2000 steps/day (SD 4017 steps/day) [17]. To have a two- 
sided signiﬁcance of p < 0.05 at a power of b Z 0.80 130 
patients were needed. To compensate for expected 
dropout 20% extra patients were included. Because of non- 
normality of data, differences between counselling and 
usual care group were tested with a ManneWhitney U test 
for 0 to 3 months and 0 to 15 months for the total group and 
subsequently for the three healthcare settings separately. 
the associations between the different 
outcome measures Spearman’s correlations were calcu- 
lated between change scores of daily steps, daily physical 
activity, 6MWD, CRQ and CCQ in the counselling group. 

All statistical analyses were performed using Scientiﬁc 
Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18.0. P-values 
<0.05 were considered to be signiﬁcant. 

In total 173 patients were screened and 155 were ran- 
domized. A detailed ﬂow diagram of the study is shown in 
Figure 1, including information on reasons of dropout. The 
dropout rate from the counselling group (29.9%) did not 
differ signiﬁcantly from that in the usual care group 
(27.6%). Baseline characteristics of the total group and the 
three subgroups are shown in Table 1. Patients in the PR 
group were signiﬁcantly younger, less physically active, had 
a higher RV%TLC, and had worse sumscore on the CRQ than 
patients in the primary care or secondary care group. 
Additionally, all the groups differed from each other in 
FEV1% predicted, FEV1% FVC, 6MWD and CCQ sumscore. 
Table 2 shows the characteristics of the counselling and 
usual care group at different measurement points. 

Primary outcomes 
The changes in daily steps and daily physical activity, from 
0 to 3 months and 0 to 15 months are presented in Table 3 
and Figures 2 and 3. Daily steps and daily physical activity 
signiﬁcantly increased after 3 months in the counselling 
group compared to usual care; subgroup analysis showed 
signiﬁcant changes in the secondary care and PR groups. 
After 15 months a trend for increased physical activity level 
(p Z 0.062) was found in the total group but not in the 
subgroups. When we excluded patients with a baseline daily 
steps level >10,000/day, who can be considered to be 
sufﬁciently active already, a signiﬁcant long-term differ- 
ence in daily physical activity, between counselling and 
usual care in the total group could indeed be demonstrated 
(p Z 0.017) (online Table 1). 




Secondary outcomes 
Overall, no signiﬁcant changes in secondary outcome vari- 
ables were found except for the improvements in 6MWD 
(p Z 0.049) and CRQ sumscore (p Z 0.006) after 3 months 
in the secondary care group (online Table 2). 
There were no signiﬁcant correlations between changes 
in physical activity (daily steps and daily physical activity) 
and changes in 6MWD, CRQ, CCQ, neither for the total 
group (see online Table 3), nor for the subgroups. 

This study demonstrates that the physical activity coun- 
selling programme effectively increased daily step count 
and daily physical activity after 3 months compared to 
usual care. The median difference between counselling and 
usual care was 803 steps (13% increase in the counselling 
group, 4% decrease in usual care), and 2214 step equiva- 
lents, (22% increase in the counselling group, 12% decrease

in usual care). A trend for increased daily physical activity 
after 15 months was found in the total group (p Z 0.062); 
when patients with a baseline daily steps level >10,000/ 
day, who can be considered to be sufﬁciently physically 
active already, were excluded, the long-term effect of the 
counselling on daily physical activity was statistically sig- 
niﬁcant indeed. No effect was shown on exercise capacity 
and quality of life except for the change in 6MWD and CRQ 
scores after 3 months in the secondary care group. This 
group beneﬁtted most as it showed the largest improve- 
ments (1816 daily steps and 2616 steps þ step equivalents). 
Dropout rates were rather high, but did not differ from 
dropout from usual care. 
Physical activity counselling studies have demonstrated 
positive results in other disease populations [31e35]. Con- 
tent and duration of the interventions differed, which may 
explain differences in effectiveness. Fibromyalgia patients 
were stimulated to achieve 30 min of moderate-intensity 
activity per day and reported a decrease in perceived 
functional deﬁcits and pain and an increase in physical 
activity after 12 weeks that could not be maintained after 6 
and 12 months [31]. A pedometer-based telephone inter- 
vention of 6 weeks in cardiac patients resulted in an in- 
crease in physical activity, which was still present after 6 
months [35]. It is generally acknowledged that behavioural 
change programmes are more likely to succeed when the 
intervention period is longer than 6 months. The Stages of 
Change model suggests that a person, who tries to change 
behaviour, should start and stay in the ‘action’ phase for 
about six months before entering the ‘maintenance’ phase 
[36]. Two recent studies with longer intervention periods 
indeed showed sustained effects. A home-based pro- 
gramme of 11 months aimed at integrating physical activity 
into daily routine supported by telephone calls compared to 
regular supervised exercise training and a control group of 
sedentary older subjects [33]. The lifestyle intervention 
group in this study showed improvements in physical ac- 
tivity, 
functional performance and cardiorespiratory 
ﬁtness, directly after the intervention which were main- 
tained after 12 months [33,34]. A 24 weeks’ pedometer- 
based intervention in diabetes type 2 patients resulted in 
an increased activity pattern, which was maintained after 
one year [32]. In COPD a six months period of PR was 
necessary to increase physical activity, although three 
months of rehabilitation was sufﬁcient to improve exercise 
capacity and quality of life [37]. This also suggests that 
longer intervention periods are needed to improve physical 
activity in COPD patients. 
In our study, signiﬁcant changes in physical activity level 
between counselling and usual care group were shown in 
the secondary care group and the PR group, whereas no 
signiﬁcant change was found in the primary care group. We 
suggest that this difference is caused by differences in 
severity of disease between these three groups. A number 
of behavioural change theories, like the Health Belief 
Model, the Self Determination Theory and the Goal Setting 
theory, suggest that individuals are only motivated to 
change behaviour, when they fear health consequences of 
an unhealthy lifestyle or expect beneﬁts of behavioural 
change [38e40]. Patients with less severe disease, such as 
those in the primary care group, suffer less from their 
disease and it may therefore be less likely that they change

their activity pattern. In addition these patients generally 
had already higher baseline physical activity levels, leaving 
less room for improvement than in patients with more se- 
vere disease, indicating that interventions aiming at phys- 
ical activity are probably more beneﬁcial in patients with 
more severe disease. 
The effects of the physical activity counselling pro- 
gramme on physical activity were not well maintained after 
15 months, though a clear trend was shown (p Z 0.062) 
towards positive effects. In line with that, when excluding 
patients with a baseline step level >10,000, who can be 
considered as sufﬁciently active already, a signiﬁcant long- 
term change in the counselling group compared to usual 
care was found. Our suggestion for the PR group that im- 
provements in exercise capacity and muscle function, 
induced by PR, could be maintained in presence of a more 
active lifestyle after PR, was not proven. Our interpretation 
of these ﬁndings is that patients in the PR group had more 
severe COPD, making them more frail and susceptible to 
exacerbations greatly inﬂuencing their physical activity 
level. The high number of dropouts (45% from the coun- 
selling arm of the study) in the PR group supports this 
explanation, but also hinders ﬁrm conclusions. For the

secondary care group long-term results were somewhat 
better but not signiﬁcant. Apparently, maintaining an 
active lifestyle is much more challenging than starting it. 
Our physical activity counselling programme had only 
limited effect on secondary outcomes, like the improve- 
ment of 6MWD and CRQ score in the secondary care group 
after 3 months. This may off course be due to type 1 errors, 
as this study was powered to detect relevant change in 
steps and not in quality of life or exercise capacity. How- 
ever some other explanations are possible. In the primary 
care setting this absence of effect may be due to a higher 
baseline physical activity level, CRQ sumscore and 6MWD 
(95% of predicted) in these patients, which leaves not much 
room for improvement. On the other hand, in the PR group, 
both treatment arms received physical training and psy- 
chosocial education, which may have limited the additional 
beneﬁts of our physical activity counselling programme on 
exercise capacity and quality of life. In general, an increase 
in physical activity might not easily be translated into 
additional improvements in quality of life and exercise 
capacity, which is supported by the weak and non- 
signiﬁcant correlations between both in our study. On the 
other hand, exercising on moderate intensity, the intensity 
of most lifestyle physical activity, for 15 min/day or 90 min/ 
week already reduces all cause mortality with 14% and 
increased life expectancy with 3 years in the general pop- 
ulation [41]. Every additional increase of 15 min of physical 
activity beyond this minimum of 15 min/day further 
reduced all cause mortality by 4%. Thus, the relationships 
between PA on the one hand, and quality of life, physical 
ﬁtness and mortality on the other hand are not fully 
elucidated and further studies in the general population as 
well as in COPD are deﬁnitely needed. 
Our study design has particular strengths and weak- 
nesses. A strong point is that a broad range of COPD pa- 
tients was included, with three well-deﬁned subgroups, 
which enables generalization of outcomes. Another strong 
point is that not only short-term but also long-term effects 
of a physical activity counselling programme in COPD were 
studied: the absence of signiﬁcant long-term effects em- 
phasizes the need for developing interventions for main- 
tenance of beneﬁcial effects of counselling such as in the 
present study. And ﬁnally the tool for intervention and 
measurement of the primary outcome variable, physical 
activity, was the same namely the pedometer, which ob- 
tains actual values of walking, an important form of phys- 
ical activity. 
Some limitations should be mentioned. Firstly, the 
pedometer we used does not measure non-ambulatory 
physical activity like cycling or swimming. We chose to 
calculate step equivalents from activities that could not be 
measured by the pedometer and were noted in activity 
diaries in minutes/day [20,42]. 
Secondly, usual care was not the same for all subgroups, 
as patients in the PR group additionally received PR. As the 
power calculation was based on a pilot study in which 
counselling was the single treatment, the power for this 
study would theoretically be lower. Despite this we found a 
signiﬁcant short-term effect of the counselling on physical 
activity. 
For clinical practice the results of our study show that 
in the 

treatment of COPD patients in various settings. It can be 
used as a single treatment option in less severe COPD pa- 
tients, but also be part of a regular PR programme, adjunct 
to exercise training and other psychosocial interventions. 
We suggest that more feedback moments over a longer 
period could make the intervention more effective in the 
long term. It has been demonstrated that adherence 
counselling after PR leads to maintenance of increases of 
daily activity, exercise adherence and exercise capacity 
after 1 year [43]. Furthermore, we suggest that in primary 
care patients should be selected more speciﬁcally for 
having low baseline physical activity, low exercise capacity 
and/or high motivation for physical activity. 
In developing other physical activity counselling pro- 
grammes modern tools for real time feedback may be used, 
such as sound or visual signals from a pedometer, acceler- 
ometer or smartphone. The feasibility of using an acceler- 
ometer and pedometer integrated into a mobile phone to 
support exercise training and physical activity has already 
been investigated in cardiac patients and the effects will be 
further investigated in a randomized controlled trial [44]. 
In conclusion, our study shows that a 12 weeks’ physical 
activity counselling programme enhances physical activity 
level in COPD patients in the short term, which is main- 
tained at 15 months in patients with baseline daily step 
count <10,000 steps per day. The effects were most 
prominent in patients attending the outpatient clinic. 
Physical activity counselling might be used in various 
healthcare settings.
