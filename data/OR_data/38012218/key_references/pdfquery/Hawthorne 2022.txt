Abstract 
Background: The use of vital signs monitoring in the early recognition of an acute exacerbation of chronic obstruc‑ 
tive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) post‑hospital discharge is limited. This study investigated whether continuous vital 
signs monitoring could predict an AECOPD and readmission. 
Methods: 35 people were recruited at discharge following hospitalisation for an AECOPD. Participants were asked 
to wear an Equivital LifeMonitor during waking hours for 6 weeks and to complete the Exacerbations of Chronic 
Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT), a 14‑item symptom diary, daily. The Equivital LifeMonitor recorded respiratory rate 
(RR), heart rate (HR), skin temperature (ST) and physical activity (PA) every 15‑s. An AECOPD was classified as mild (by 
EXACT score), moderate (prescribed oral steroids/antibiotics) or severe (hospitalisation). 
Results: Over the 6‑week period, 31 participants provided vital signs and symptom data and 14 participants experi‑ 
enced an exacerbation, of which, 11 had sufficient data to predict an AECOPD. HR and PA were associated with EXACT 
score (p < 0.001). Three days prior to an exacerbation, RR increased by mean 
of 11 exacerbations and HR increased by 8.1 





Conclusions: Increased heart rate and reduced physical activity were associated with worsening symptoms. Even 
with high‑resolution data, the variation in vital signs data remains a challenge for predicting AECOPDs. Respiratory 
rate and heart rate should be further explored as potential predictors of an impending AECOPD.

people’s health-related quality of life [2, 3] and are costly 
to the healthcare system [4]. The AECOPD readmission 
rate post-discharge at 30 days and 90 days is 24% and 43% 
respectively [5]. 
Pulse oximetry, peak flow and symptoms are commonly 
used to monitor patients health [6–8]. Respiratory rate, 
however, has been shown to increase during an exacerba- 
tion [9, 10], and has therefore been suggested as a poten- 
tial target for telemonitoring for the early identification 
and treatment of AECOPD to prevent hospital admission 
[10, 11]. Alongside other vital signs, respiratory rate can 
now be measured passively and continuously but stud- 
ies measuring respiratory rate have previously been lim- 
ited to those on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) [via 
built-in O2 supplemental devices] [12–14] or devices that 
require installation or record only once per day [15–17]. 
In addition to physiological vital signs, behavioural data 
may provide a signal for health deterioration. Physical 
activity has been independently associated with increased 
risk of hospitalisation [18] and readmission [19]. 
Early management of an AECOPD is associated with a 
faster recovery [20, 21]. Whilst people living with COPD 
are able to identify symptomatic changes in their condi- 
tion, it can be difficult to notice impending severe deteri- 
oration [22, 23], and studies assessing patient symptoms 
continue to show that many AECOPDs are not reported 
to a clinician despite deterioration in symptoms [24]. 
Vital signs monitoring has shown some promise in the 
early recognition of exacerbations [7, 25] but previous 
research evaluating the use of remote monitoring devices 
has often been limited by low participant adherence, 
recall bias and participant burden from multiple devices. 
Whilst there has been an increase in the use of multipa- 
rameter technology to measure vital signs continuously 
[26], the accuracy of some devices, including pulse oxi- 
metry, have been questioned [27] and few have been able 
to passively, continuously, and non-invasively measure 
vital signs to predict exacerbations [28]. 
We aimed to evaluate whether non-invasive, passive, 
and continuous monitoring of vital signs can (i) identify 
time-series associations between respiratory rate, heart 
rate, skin temperature and physical activity and symp- 
toms and (ii) predict an AECOPD and readmission. 
Methods 
Study design 
from January 2018–December 2019 at the University 
Hospitals of Leicester, United Kingdom. 

People admitted to hospital for an AECOPD were 
recruited when medically fit for discharge. Inclusion cri- 
teria were: ≥ 18 years of age, a confirmed clinical diag- 
nosis of COPD from spirometry data in medical records 
(FEV1/FVC< 0.7), and an admission with a primary 
 
diagnosis of exacerbation of COPD. Participants were 
excluded if they had a visual or physical impairment 
preventing them from wearing the vest, e.g., wheelchair 
bound or a psychological comorbidity preventing their 
participation, e.g., dementia, required palliative care or 
were unable or unwilling to provide written informed 
consent. 

All participants were asked to wear an Equivital 
EQ02 + LifeMonitor (Equivital, Cambridge, UK) [29] 
during waking hours for 6 consecutive weeks (the day 
after discharge considered day 1). The Equivital LifeMon- 
itor is a vest-like wearable device with a sensor electronic 
module that sits in a cradle on the side of the LifeMoni- 
tor. Participants were asked to remove the LifeMonitor 
during water-based activities and to charge the device 
at least every other night. The number of days that the 
LifeMonitor was worn was examined and wear time was 
calculated as the average time the LifeMonitor was worn 
on a single day. The Equivital LifeMonitor measured res- 
piratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), skin temperature (ST) 
and physical activity (PA) [30]. RR and HR were calcu- 
lated as average daily values during wear time. Daily PA 
was calculated as the proportion of daily wear time when 
the participant was ambulatory. Further details and the 
usability and acceptability of the LifeMonitor in a COPD 
population have previously been reported [31]. 

To measure COPD symptoms, participants were asked 
to complete the Exacerbation of Chronic Pulmonary 
Disease Tool (EXACT) each day. This 14-item patient- 
reported questionnaire evaluates breathlessness, cough 
and sputum and chest symptoms [32, 33], with the total 
EXACT score ranging from 0 to 100 and higher scores 
indicating greater symptom severity. 
We performed a prospective, observational cohort study 
of the recovery of people discharged following hospitali- 
sation for an AECOPD. All participants provided written 
informed consent. This single centre study obtained ethi- 
cal approval (Research Ethics Committee 15/LO/2055), 
was registered (ISRCTN12855961), and was undertaken 

A mild exacerbation was considered a symptom- 
based AECOPD in accordance with the EXACT scor- 
ing; specifically, an increase from baseline of 9 points 
(for 3 consecutive days) or 12 points (for 2 consecu- 
tive days) [32]. A moderate exacerbation was defined 


by worsening of symptoms where patients required a 
prescribed course of oral steroids and/or antibiotics. 
A severe exacerbation was defined by hospitalisation/ 
readmission due to AECOPD. 

Demographics, clinical histories, comorbidities, and 
spirometry data were obtained from medical records 
or information provided by participants. Height and 
weight were provided by the participant, obtained 
from medical records, or measured using a portable 
stadiometer and weighing scales. 
The modified Medical 
Council 

(MRC) dyspnoea scale [34] was used to measure 
breathlessness. 

Participants were divided into two groups according 
to whether they experienced any classification of an 
AECOPD during the 6-week study period (AECOPD 
group) or whether they did not (No AECOPD group). 
Data were analysed and graphs were generated using 
R version 4.0.0. Continuous variables distributions 
were assessed for normality. Data are reported as 
mean (SD) or median (inter-quartile range) and differ- 
ences between groups were assessed using two sample 
unpaired T-test or Mann–Whitney U test. Frequency 
comparisons between groups were assessed using Fish- 
er’s test, with alpha = 0.05. 
To investigate associations, a linear mixed model 
was fitted for EXACT score. Independent variables 
were RR, HR, ST, PA and time point, and there were no 
instances of multicollinearity. A random intercept was 
included for each participant. The linear mixed model 
was fitted using lmer from the lme4 package [35]. 
Individual time series plots were analysed to identify 
the changes in vital signs prior to an exacerbation. Data 
were analysed at 3 days, 2 days, and the day before an 
exacerbation, by calculating the percentage change to 
the first day of an exacerbation. The average percent- 
age change for all participants and the population mean 
were used to calculate changes in vital signs. 
To capture changes in vital signs around the onset 
of an exacerbation we compared values during stable 
symptoms, near to an exacerbation and at the onset 
of exacerbation. These values were taken from; 3 con- 
secutive days where the participant experienced sta- 
ble symptoms during the study period (stable); 3 days 
prior to the onset of exacerbation (near exacerbation); 
and the day of exacerbation onset (exacerbation). Violin 
plots were used to visualise the group-level data. 
Results 
Participant characteristics 
Of the 31 participants analysed, 14 participants (45.1%) 
experienced an AECOPD (Fig. 1). Three participants 
(21%) experienced > 1 AECOPD during the 6-week 
study period, so the total number of exacerbations was 
18 (10 mild, three moderate and five severe). The No 
AECOPD group wore the LifeMonitor for significantly 
fewer days but were otherwise similar to the AECOPD 
group. In both groups the most prevalent comorbidi- 
ties were cardiac disease and hypertension, followed by 
musculoskeletal disorders (Table 1). 

Results for the mixed model are shown in Table 2, and 
the full output for the model is shown in Additional 
file 2: Tables S1. A statistically significant association 
was found between HR and EXACT score (coefficient, 
95% CI, p value; 0.27, 0.16 to 0.33, p < 0.001) and PA 
was shown to be negatively associated with EXACT 
score (− 0.22, − 0.33 to − 0.09, p < 0.001) (Table 2). 
Predicting an AECOPD post‑discharge 
Prior to AECOPD 
Of the 18 exacerbations, four (22%) occurred too early 
post-discharge to obtain sufficient data to analyse prior 
to the exacerbation, and a further three participants 
(17%) did not provide data in the 3 days prior to the 
exacerbation, leaving 11 exacerbations that could be 
analysed during this period. Seven of the 11 exacer- 
bations had increased RR 3 days prior to the onset of 
exacerbation (mean[SD]; 2.0 [0.2] breaths/min). Nine of 
11 exacerbations showed an increase in HR from 3 days 
prior to the onset of exacerbation (8.1 [0.7] bpm). There 
were no noticeable changes for ST or PA. Prior to an 
exacerbation, seven exacerbations showed an increase 
in ST (0.5 [0.01] °C), four exacerbations showed a 
decrease in ST (− 1.0 [0.03] °C), five exacerbations 
showed an increase in PA (0.9 [0.4] hrs) and six exacer- 
bations showed a decrease in PA (− 0.3 [0.1] hrs). 
Figure 2 shows the time series plots for RR, HR, ST 
and PA against EXACT score for a single participant 
who experienced a severe exacerbation. All individ- 
ual plots and the collective summary can be found in 
Additional file 1: Fig. S2 and Additional file 3: Table S3, 
respectively. 

Some participants continued to wear the LifeMo- 
nitor during the exacerbation period, where seven of 
the 18 exacerbations (39%) provided sufficient data. 
All seven exacerbations had an increase in RR during 
 


the exacerbation period (mean[SD]; 0.8 [0.1] breaths/ 
min), and HR was seen to increase during the exacer- 
bation period for six of the seven exacerbations (6.7 
[0.9] bpm). For ST, four of the seven exacerbations had 
an increase in ST during the exacerbation period (0.3 
[0.01] °C) and three had a decrease in ST (− 1.2 [0.01] 
°C). Three of the seven exacerbations had an increase 
in PA during the exacerbation period (0.9 [0.4] hrs) and 
four had a decrease in PA (− 0.2 [0.1] hrs). 

For the 15 exacerbations that could be analysed, there 
was very little change in HR, ST, and PA between stable 
symptoms, near to exacerbation and the onset of exac- 
erbation (Fig. 3). RR increased from stable symptoms to 
near exacerbation, and further increased to the onset 
of exacerbation (median[IQR]; 19.6[5.7] to 21.5[7.1] to

Discussion 
Heart rate and physical activity were associated with 
symptom severity (EXACT score). Exploring individuals’ 
changes in vital signs prior to an AECOPD showed that 
in nine out of 11 exacerbations heart rate increased on 
average by 8 bpm and in 7 out of 11 exacerbations res- 
piratory rate increased on average by 2 breaths/min. The 
predictive capabilities of statistical models for the group 
were limited by variation in vital signs between individu- 
als and the limited sample size. Thus, respiratory rate and 
heart rate should be further explored as potential predic- 
tors of future AECOPDs post-discharge. 

Results from the present study suggest that respiratory 
rate was not associated with symptoms over the 6-week 
study period. However, analysis prior to an AECOPD 
suggests that respiratory rate may be useful in predicting 
an AECOPD. Respiratory rate telemonitoring to predict 
an AECOPD has shown inconsistent results [11–16, 25, 
36]. Our findings are in line with other studies that have 
measured respiratory rate continuously in those receiving 
LTOT, as Yanez et al. [14] observed a change in respira- 
tory rate from baseline, with a 15–30% increase (2.3–4.4 
breaths/min) 24–48 h before hospitalisation. Blouet et al. 
[12] reported a smaller increase of 2.1 breaths/min across 
10 days preceding admission to hospital for a severe 
AECOPD. In the present study, on average, respiratory 
rate increased by 2.0 breaths/min 3 days prior to exacer- 
bation and by 2.2 breaths/min the day before the onset. 
Most previous studies that have remotely monitored res- 
piratory rate have typically recruited people with stable 
COPD symptoms to predict exacerbations [12–15], and 
we have observed a similar increase in respiratory rate for 
those experiencing an AECOPD during recovery from 
hospitalisation. Vital sign variation between individuals 
makes their predictive capabilities more challenging [6], 
however, respiratory rate warrants further exploration as 
a possible early predictor of readmission post-discharge.

In the present study, all participants who wore the Life- 
Monitor during the exacerbation period experienced an 
increase in respiratory rate. Our results are in accordance 
with other studies that have observed an increase in res- 
piratory rate for patients hospitalised for an AECOPD 
[10, 11]. Although respiratory rate is the most common 
objective measurement of respiration, there are other 
respiratory changes associated with an AECOPD and 
recovery. For example, lung mechanics [37], respiratory 
sounds [38] and neural respiratory drive [17] have been 
assessed in an AECOPD population but difficulties still 
remain in the use of non-invasive, continuous measure- 
ment modalities that are accepted by people with COPD. 

In the present study, HR values over the six weeks were 
associated with symptoms and changes in HR could pos- 
sibly predict an AECOPD. Previous studies have provided 
mixed results regarding the use of HR in predicting exac- 
erbations, with some studies suggesting that HR cannot 
predict an AECOPD [36, 39]. Our results are in accord- 
ance with other studies that identified HR as a useful vital 
sign for predicting exacerbations [6, 7, 15, 40]. The pre- 
sent study found that HR increased by 8 bpm 3 days prior 
to exacerbation onset; similar to Burton et al. [6], Rajeh 
et al. [40] and Hurst et al. [7] (increase of 7 bpm at the 
start of exacerbation, increase of 7 bpm the day before 
and 7 bpm 3 days before an AECOPD), and greater than 
Shah et al. [15] (3 bpm increase in the week prior to exac- 
erbation onset). The assessment of patient symptoms is 
varied among studies, and as such a more comprehen- 
sive symptom diary may provide more detail regarding 
changes in patients health. The increase in respiratory 
rate prior to an AECOPD observed in the present study 
and other studies [6, 7, 15, 40], may be due to the identi- 
fication of milder exacerbations via a detailed symptom 
diary. 
Both patients and clinicians express considerable con- 
fidence in pulse oximetry [22], and as such many studies 
have remotely monitored both HR and oxygen saturation 
(SpO2)in combination using pulse oximetry [6, 7, 15, 40]. 
 
Whilst some studies have highlighted the use of pulse 
oximetry for predicting AECOPDs [7, 25, 36], measure- 
ments are often limited to once daily as practical issues 
of continuous and non-invasive monitoring exist. Blood 
pressure (BP) has also been assessed as a vital sign to pre- 
dict exacerbations and hospital admissions [41], however, 
similar to SpO2, it is impractical to continuously measure 
BP during free-living conditions. It should be noted that 
the Equivital LifeMonitor used in the present study can 
monitor SpO2 and BP using additional devices connected 
to the vest. However, other studies have shown partici- 
pants prefer devices without a pulse-oximeter probe [42], 
and at the time of the study additional devices were not 
deemed feasible according to patient and public involve- 
ment feedback and would have had implications of bat- 
tery and memory life restricting extended monitoring 
periods. Given the more recent advances in cuffless BP 
measurements, Hosanee et al. [43] have suggested that 
a wrist device may be the most appropriate cuffless BP 
measurement, and although a wrist device is often pre- 
ferred by people living with COPD [28], there are techni- 
cal implications for measuring heart rate and respiratory 
rate [11]. Future integration of wearable technology 
remains a challenge due to the difficulties in capturing 
SpO2, BP, respiratory rate, heart rate, skin temperature 
and physical activity measurements with a single, non- 
invasive device. 
 

The present study identified no associations between skin 
temperature and symptoms or experiencing an AECOPD, 
and no associations between physical activity and experi- 
encing an AECOPD. In line with previous studies exam- 
ining body temperature [36, 39], we observed no notable 
changes in skin temperature prior to an AECOPD which 
may be caused by measurements tending towards the 
ambient or inner clothing temperature due to the nature 
of the technology. As a strong predictor of mortality 
in COPD, physical activity is a core component of self- 
management interventions [44], and it has now become 
a behavioural vital sign that is commonly measured in 
a COPD population [33, 45–47]. Similar to a previous 
study that assessed physical activity using a pedometer 
and symptoms via the EXACT diary [33], the present 
study observed an association between worsening symp- 
toms and a decrease in physical activity. However, there 
were no notable changes in physical activity leading up 
to an AECOPD. Physical activity is characteristically low 
in a COPD population, particularly post-AECOPD [45, 
46], suggesting a floor-effect may exist, whereby individu- 
als have already minimised physical activity levels. This 
emphasises the need for early identification of exacerba- 
tions to allow patients to maintain their physical activity 
levels and overall health-related quality of life. 

A limitation of the study is the sample attrition due to 
the study being conducted during a challenging period 
for individuals post-AECOPD, which has been reflected 
in other research [48–50] and in interventions such as 
post-exacerbation Pulmonary Rehabilitation [5]. Health- 
ier individuals are more likely to consent to research 
participation and as such there is potential selection bias 
which may contribute towards our low readmission rate. 
From visual inspection of individual participant data, we 
 


generated further associations between vital signs and 
exacerbations, although the small sample size limited 
our ability to stratify by severity of exacerbation. Meas- 
uring vital signs overnight may have provided more con- 
sistent ‘baseline’ values for vital signs, helping to reduce 
observed variation. Across all studies, the lack of consen- 
sus in the classifications of AECOPD and baseline values 
makes it challenging to perform direct comparisons. 
Conclusions 
Continuous and non-invasive monitoring of vital signs 
during the post-discharge period showed that increased 
heart rate and reduced physical activity were associ- 
ated with greater symptom severity. At the individual 
level, respiratory rate and heart rate cannot be ruled out 
as potential predictors of an impending AECOPD and 
should be further explored in relation to preventing read- 
missions and exacerbations. The predictive capabilities of 
the data are hindered by the large individual variation of 
vital signs measured in the free-living environment.
