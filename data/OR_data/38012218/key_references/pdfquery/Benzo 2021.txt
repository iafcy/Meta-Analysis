BACKGROUND: Pulmonary rehabilitation is an effective treatment for patients with COPD, but 
patient uptake and adherence to the current offering of center-based pulmonary rehabilitation is 
modest due to transportation, access, poverty, and frailty, and even more so in the context of the 
COVID pandemic. Home-based options have been proposed and were found noninferior to center- 
based rehabilitation; however, there is a lack of home-based programs, and more understanding is 
needed. We aimed to test the feasibility, uptake, and adherence to a home-based program for 
COPD rehabilitation with health coaching. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial with a 
wait-list controlled design to evaluate the effects of a home-based program with health coaching on 
breathlessness in subjects with moderate to severe COPD unable to attend the regular pulmonary 
rehabilitation program. The 8-week intervention consisted of video-guided exercises to be done 6 
times a week and captured with a computer tablet. Health coaching was done weekly over the tele- 
phone to review subject activity and symptoms and to provide an opportunity for the subject to 
define their weekly goals. The primary outcomes were uptake, adherence, and Chronic Respiratory 
Questionnaire (CRQ) Dyspnea Domain. Secondary outcomes were self-management abilities and 
CRQ Emotions-Mastery-Fatigue. RESULTS: 154 subjects with moderate to severe COPD were 
randomized. Subject adherence was 86% to the proposed 6-times a week exercise routine. There 
(P 5 .062) was no significant difference in breathlessness (CRQ dyspnea). There was a significant 
improvement in self-management abilities (P < .001). The results of the qualitative interviews 
showed high levels of acceptability of the program. CONCLUSIONS: The tested home-based reha- 
bilitation program with health coaching was feasible, highly acceptable, showed a high degree of ad- 
herence, and improved self-management abilities. This study offers seminal information for home- 
based rehabilitation programs to design alternative options of rehabilitation to individuals with COPD 
that cannot attend to the well-established center-based pulmonary rehabilitation. (ClinicalTrials.gov

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an effective treat- 
ment for patients with COPD,1 but patient uptake and 
adherence to the current offering of center-based PR is 
modest.2-4 Previous work has demonstrated that 50% of 
eligible COPD patients do not attend PR, and of those 
who do begin PR, 50% will not complete the program.5 
PR completion is also very low after a hospitalization 
when PR can have a big impact: only 1.9% of patie- 
nts received PR within 6 months of their hospital dis- 
charge.6,7 PR is a good example of a highly effective 
intervention that has only modest implementation. The 
main factors for poor uptake and adherence to PR 
include transportation, distance, depression, poverty, 
and motivation to change (current smoking as a behavior 
is at the top of the list of independent factors associated 
with low uptake and completion of PR).8 Alternative 
forms of rehabilitation are needed beyond the well- 
established and effective center-based PR to increase 
reach, 
to personal needs, and to increase 
inclusivity. 

Several randomized controlled trials suggest the noninfe- 
rior effectiveness of home-based rehabilitation.9,10 Holland 



et al10 proposed an intervention that included a home visit 
by a physiotherapist and weekly telephone calls including 
personalized support and guidance using Motivational 
Interviewing. Horton et al9 included 2 telephone calls in a 
7-week program and a detailed manual for the participant 
to follow during the program. Both included training of the 
providers in Motivational Interviewing like in the interven- 
tion presented in this paper. 
There is still a need for further understanding of home- 
based programs to create alternative rehabilitation options 
that are feasible, can reach most patients, and are safe, ac- 
ceptable, effective, and potentially billable, all essential 
ingredients for sustainable implementation. Rehabilitation 
at its core means restoring function, a goal that needs to 
be personalized and can be achieved at different inten- 
sities of exercise prescription and locations (home or 
center). 
Health coaching also represents an opportunity to 
improve perceived function and health outcomes. 
Health coaching is about engaging with people where 
they are in their journey of coping with a chronic condi- 
tion, and collaboratively focusing on goals that repre- 
sent patients’ choices. We previously published the 
feasibility and effectiveness of telephonic health coach- 
ing in decreasing re-hospitalization and sustainably 
improving the quality of life in subjects with very 
severe COPD.11,12 Health coaching may therefore repre- 
sent an effective addition to home-based rehabilitation 
programs that may add a behavior change component to 
home-based interventions. 

interventions like health coaching 
can improve quality of life and reduce exacerbations in 
individuals with COPD.13 Such interventions focus on 
improving these individuals’ confidence and skills in 
managing symptoms and treatment. Intervention content

typically includes action planning and personalized sup- 
port from a health care professional14,15 or nonlicensed 
coaches.11 The aim is to utilize health coaching to facili- 
tate behavior change. 
Remote monitoring may represent another tool to reach 
individuals and deliver rehabilitation in the convenience of 
their own home. Previous research has shown that just 
monitoring physiologic parameters alone without a mean- 
ingful discussion of the findings and planning based on 
results is ineffective.16,17 
We aimed to assess feasibility, uptake, adherence, and 
patient experience alongside the effectiveness of a home- 
based rehabilitation program with health coaching. We previ- 
ously reported the development and pilot testing of this 
home-based program for COPD rehabilitation that involved 
both commercially available monitors and telephonic health 
coaching.2 

We conducted a randomized trial with a wait-list con- 
trolled design to evaluate the effects of a home-based pro- 
gram with health coaching on breathlessness in subjects 
with moderate to severe COPD unable to attend the 



Current knowledge 
Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an effective treatment 
for patients with COPD, but patient uptake and adher- 
ence to the current offering of center-based PR is mod- 
est. Alternative forms of rehabilitation are needed to 
increase reach and inclusivity; home-based programs 
and health coaching are potential alternatives to bring 
PR to more individuals with COPD. There is a need for 
further understanding of home-based PR programs to 
create options that are feasible, effective, acceptable to 
patients, and potentially billable, all essential ingre- 
dients for sustainable implementation. 
What this paper contributes to our knowledge 
We found that home-based PR with health coaching 
was feasible and highly acceptable to subjects with 
COPD, reflected in the high degree of adherence. 
Home-based PR with health coaching increased self- 
management abilities and created conditions for a 
behavior change to a healthier lifestyle. Our results 
inform our current understanding of home-based PR 
programs in COPD, and offer the patient’s perspectives 
and the mechanistic effect of the combination of home- 
based rehabilitation with health coaching on self-man- 
agement abilities.

regular PR program. The 8-week intervention consisted of 
video-guided exercises (see the supplementary materials 
at http://www.rcjournal.com) to be done 6 d per week 
using an oximeter for detecting exercise-related oxy- 
gen desaturation, 
the measurement of daily steps 
through an activity monitor and daily self-report of 
symptoms in a computer tablet provided by this trial. 
The recommended program did not fulfill the intensity 
recommended by the American College of Sports 
Medicine (ACSM) due to safety precautions in the con- 
text of the home environment and unsupervised modal- 
ity. However, this program fulfilled all other ACSM 
criteria for PR in COPD: modality, duration, frequency, 
and progression.18 Health coaching was done weekly 
over the telephone to review patient activity and symp- 
toms and to provide an opportunity for the subject to 
define their weekly goals (Fig. 1). 
We randomly assigned subjects at a 1:1 ratio using an 
online, computer-generated, simple binomial randomiza- 
tion program to 1 of 2 groups (no concealment). There 
was no blinding of subjects and personnel, nor there was 
blinding of outcome assessors. Group 1 received the 8- 
week intervention, and Group 2 had an 8-week control 
period and then was compassionately offered the inter- 
vention after completing the measures at the end of the 
control period. 

Subjects diagnosed with COPD by a clinician (primary 
inclusion criteria), confirmed by GOLD guidelines and eli- 
gible for PR, age $ 40 y, with $ 10 pack-years of smoking, 
and able to speak English were eligible for inclusion. 
Exclusion criteria were a high likelihood of being lost to fol- 
low-up (eg, patients with active chemical dependence), not 
being able to complete measures, or having severe cognitive 
impairment (ie, having a higher risk of not completing 
PR).19 The clinical trial ran from September 2016 through 
April 2019. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic 
institutional review board (#14-009016) and posted in 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02557178) on September 2015, and 
the first subject was randomized in September 2016. 

Subjects in the intervention arm received an Android tablet 
(Google, Menlo Park, California) with the interactive PR pro- 
gram and cellular service (Verizon Communications, New 
York, New York), a FDA-approved pulse oximeter (3150 
WristOx2; Nonin Medical, Plymouth, Minnesota), and a 
Vı´vofit activity monitor (Garmin, Schaffhausen, Switzerland) 
(Fig. 1). Both the pulse oximeter and the activity monitor 
were connected to the tablet via Bluetooth. The PR program

presented a daily to-do list, which offered 4 items (Fig. 2): (1) 
Complete daily exercises (ie, 11 min of breathing-focused 
arm movements, either standing or sitting [flexibility prac- 
tice]), (2) Walk 6 min (ie, a very slow, balance-driven, and 
breathing-focused in-home walk [balance practice]), (3) Walk 
for another 6 min, and (4) Answer your daily questions (ie, 3 
self-report questions to monitor daily symptoms to track over- 
all well-being, breathing, and energy). Subjects were 
requested to complete the daily exercise practice (very slow 
walks) 6 d per week. All activity completed (ie, steps, report- 
ing symptoms, and daily exercises with oxygenation and heart 
rate data) was visible to the health coach on a secure website 
(Fig. 2). Activities were designed using the FITT principles of 
Frequency (ie, 6 d per week), Intensity (ie, low), Time (ie, 20 
min), and Type (ie, upper extremity [Arm–Size] and lower 
extremity [walking]).20 
The tablet program also offered visualization of progress 
in a chart tab, where subjects could see auto-populated 
graphs displaying their steps, exercise minutes, and symp- 
tom check-in answers across the 8 weeks of the interven- 
tion. A Help tab was also available for frequently asked 
questions, as well as an area where subjects could type mes- 
sages to their health coach. 
While there was no threshold established a priori for 
what was considered completion, given the exploratory 
nature of the study, 6 weeks was considered the minimum 
dose of home PR. 

Health coaching included weekly calls from health 
Interviewing.11,21 The 
coaches trained in Motivational 
method of training involved a textbook, Building Skills in 
Motivational Interviewing,22 role-playing, and a simulation 
program (SIMmersion, Columbia, Maryland) that monitors 
proficiency in Motivational Interviewing and the number of 
sessions of practice completed. To assess for fidelity to the 
Motivational Interviewing techniques, 5% of the calls were 
reviewed and scored using the global ratings from the 
Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity tool.23 
In each call, health coaches reviewed the progress of the 
subject (Fig. 2D), pointed out trends, and encouraged sub- 
ject engagement and feedback as it related to their own ex- 
perience and progress. Full details of the intervention were 
previously published.2 

All subjects completed questionnaires and 1 week of wear- 
ing an ActiGraph wGT3X-BT activity monitor (ActiGraph,

Pensacola, Florida) at baseline and after the 8-week interven- 
tion or control period. Subjects in the intervention arm com- 
pleted another set of measures 8 weeks after finishing the 
home-based program to test the trajectory of outcomes after 
inclu- 
completion of 
ded the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire–Self-Administ- 
ered (CRQ-SAS),24 Modified Medical Research Council 
(mMRC),25 Self-Management Ability Scale (SMAS-30),26 
and Working Alliance Inventory–Short Revised (WAI- 
SR).27 Daily physical activity was measured with the 
ActiGraph activity monitor, which has been validated and 
used to assess physical activity in individuals with COPD.28 
There were 2 activity monitors used in this study, both worn 
on the wrist: the Actigraph, which is the accepted standard 
for physical activity as outcome, and the Garmin monitor 
that was part of the system for the subject and the coach to 
set goals of activity in daily life. We used ACSM guidelines 
for metabolic equivalent of task (MET) cutoff to analyze ac- 
tivity monitor data: light-intensity physical activity is defined 
as requiring 2.0–2.9 METs, moderate as 3.0–5.9 METs, and 
vigorous as $ 6.0 METs. 

Following the intervention, structured qualitative inter- 
views were conducted by telephone with a random sample of 
subjects who completed the intervention. Responses to scaled 
items were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Responses to 
open-ended questions were analyzed using methods of content 
analysis.29 Two members of the study team (BT and JLR) 
reviewed transcripts and assigned content to codes represent- 
ing key domains of the survey (eg, technology satisfaction), as 
well as codes that represented latent content (eg, emoti- 
responses to intervention participation). Computer- 
onal 
assisted qualitative data analysis software (NVivo 12, QSR 
International, Doncaster, Australia) was used to facilitate data 
organization and queries. Qualitative data were explored by 
respondent outcomes (eg, dichotomized variables based on a 
significant change in SMAS-30 total and CRQ scores) to 
understand potential variation in experiences. 

This study employed a convergent approach to mixed 
methods, in which data from questionnaires and interviews 
were first analyzed separately and then compared to more 
fully understand program effectiveness.30 Members of the 
study team met to review and discuss findings from each 
method, including those on similar constructs (eg, improve- 
ments in dyspnea and self-management); side-by-side com- 
parison aided in interpretation. Methodological and analyst 
triangulation served to minimize interpretive bias and 
increase the credibility of findings.31 

Baseline subject characteristics were compared 
between study arms and tested for significance using 
chi-square tests for categorical variables, t tests for 
normally distributed continuous variables, and appro- 
priate nonparametric tests for non-normally distrib- 
uted continuous variables. Primary outcomes were 
adherence and CRQ Dyspnea. Secondary outcomes 
were self-management measured with the SMAS-30 
and the remaining CRQ domains. 
Outcomes were compared by group assignment using 
generalized linear models with a normal distribution with 
identity link for continuous outcomes, Poisson distribution 
with log link for count outcomes, and binomial distribution 
with logit link for binary outcomes. Hypothesis tests were 
2-sided, with P values < .05 considered statistically signifi- 
cant. A robust standard error was used to accommodate 
missing data under the assumption that the outcomes 
were missing at random. The target sample size of 128 
subjects provided approximately 80% power to detect 
0.5 points (considered the minimal clinically important 
difference) in the CRQ-SF Dyspnea domain score. We 
assumed 20% attrition, and a final sample of 154 sub- 
jects was proposed. A trajectory analysis looked at 
changes from baseline to follow-up at weeks 9 and 17 in 
the intervention group to investigate if the change seen 
after the intervention were maintained after 8 weeks 
postintervention. One-sample, 2-sided t tests, with 5% 
type 1 error rates, were used to determine whether these 
changes were significantly different from zero. 

A total of 154 subjects signed consent to participate 
between December 2016 and March 2018. Subjects were 
randomized to control (n ¼ 76) and intervention (n ¼ 78) 
groups (Fig. 3). A total of 119 (77%) subjects completed 
the study. There were no significant differences in reasons 
for dropout by arm. Demographics and baseline measures 
are shown in Table 1. 
The adherence to the program (expressed in the per- 
centage of total prescribed days) was 86% adherence 
for the prescribed days of the system use ($ 1 feature), 
80% for the balance-related walking practice, and 87% 
for the flexibility-related seated or standing exercises. 
Subjects’ adherence to using the Garmin monitor was 
55% or 33 d out of the 60-d intervention. From a safety 
perspective, analytics from the system indicated that the 
videos were watched and practiced (eg, having heart 
rate and oxygen saturation data) > 6,000 times without 
reported adverse effects (ie, 
injury, 
symptoms of shortness of breath or exacerbations). 





Table 2 shows an overall comparison of outcomes 
between intervention and control subjects (ie, changes from 
baseline to Week 9). There was a trend (P ¼ .062) but no 
significant difference in the primary clinical outcome of the 
study (CRQ Dyspnea). Self-management total score and 
the Self-management domains of Taking Initiative and 
Investment Behavior were statistically improved after the 
intervention (P < .001, 
.01 and < .001, respectively). 
There was no improvement in physical activity. 
Subjects who did not drop out received an average of 6 
calls during the 8-week intervention. Both groups 
reported feeling comfortable (> 5 on a self-efficacy scale 
of 1–10) using a smartphone or a computer (control 79%, 
intervention 83%), as a measure of confidence to use 
technology. 

In this within-group analysis (ie, intervention sub- 
jects only), 
the CRQ domains of Dyspnea and 
Mastery exhibited a significant change from baseline, 
and the CRQ domain of Emotion became significant 
at 8 weeks after the intervention finished. SMAS-30 
Total and the Domain Investment Behavior remained 
significant (P < .05 for all) (Table 3). Physical activ- 
ity was not significantly changed.

With regard to the WAI-SR score, the Task domain, the 
Bond domain, and the Goal domain were $ 80% of the 
indicating high engagement 
maximum possible scores, 
between the subject and health coach. In an exploratory 
analysis we found the Task domain in the WAI-SR to be 
associated with the improvement in SMAS-30 total after 
adjusting for age, gender, FEV1, and MMRC score (P ¼ 
.01, model not shown). Twenty-eight participants com- 
pleted telephone interviews. 

Interview respondents were not significantly different from 
the overall study subjects in terms of age, gender, FEV1%, or 
mMRC Dyspnea. Results of the scaled interview questions 
indicate high levels of acceptability and satisfaction with the 
program. Subjects stated that the individual components were 
easy to use, and 96% said they would recommend the pro- 
gram to others. The vast majority of subjects also rated the 
coaching component highly in terms of how well the coach 
listened and how much coaching increased their confidence 
(Table 4). 
Results of the analysis of open-ended question responses 
complemented these results and, in some cases, helped 
explain them. In terms of program satisfaction, subjects 
liked the technology and the ability to see their progress 
(Table 5). 
Qualitative analysis related to the experience with health 
coaching revealed 2 views on the benefits of coaching in 
this program. The first was that coaching provided subjects 
with a range of emotional or psychological benefits, includ- 
ing a sense of encouragement, reassurance, and understand- 
ing. Subjects felt supported by a coach who was interested 
in how they were doing. Several subjects stated that they 
wished the program was longer because they reported value 
in the coaching relationship and the accountability it pro- 
vided (Table 5). 
The second view was that coaching was beneficial 
because the coach’s informative support helped subjects be 
more effective in their technology use, including trouble- 
shooting technology issues so they could fully engage with 
the technology components, as well as the education that 
the coach provided about the disease and reasons for pro- 
gram components (Table 5). 
Finally, in terms of program effectiveness, a majority of 
subjects reported that they felt the program was effective 
because they perceived their breathing was improved. This 
sense of physical improvement was a reason they would 
recommend the program to others. Similarly, some subjects 
described the effectiveness of a holistic approach (ie, com- 
bining technology and coaching) for people with COPD. 
One subject described how this approach improved breath- 
ing and provided psychological benefits (Table 5). 

Placing the results of the quantitative and qualitative 
results side by side (ie, quantitative primary outcomes 
dichotomized into half standard deviation improvement or 
not), the study team identified several ways in which the tri- 
angulation of data sources and methods provided a fuller 
picture of the program experience and outcomes. These fall 
under the categories of (1) self-management and self-effi- 
cacy, and (2) dyspnea and quality of life. 
In terms of self-management and self-efficacy, the qualita- 
tive data provided insights into how the technology and the 
coaching worked together to keep subjects engaged in the 
exercises and learning how to feel good about managing

their COPD with appropriate techniques. In terms of dysp- 
nea, qualitative analysis of interview data, dichotomized by 
improvement in the dyspnea measure, showed that subjects 
felt like their breathing improved, regardless of whether the 
measure showed significant improvement in CRQ Dyspnea 
(> 0.5 points). Subjects’ self-described sense of improved 
breathing was tied to comments stating that the program was 
effective and worthwhile. 

We explored the feasibility uptake and adherence of 
a home-based rehabilitation program with health 
coaching in patients with COPD. We found 86% ad- 
herence for the prescribed days of the system use, 80% 
adherence to the walking practice, and 87% adherence 
to the seated or standing flexibility exercises that was 
prescribed to be done 6 d per week. This level of ad- 
herence is in itself a significant result, considering 
prior evidence that shows 50% of patients with COPD 
decline to participate in PR and 30–50% drop out 
before completion.3,5,8 Our adherence results that seem 

higher than the reported center-based PR suggest that a 
program with a lower intensity, done at home with col- 
is well 
laborative support 
accepted. This finding alone in this study is worth being 
reported and further explored, and it may increase the 
implementation and dissemination of 
rehabilitation 
(which, at its core, is intended to restore function) to 
individuals with COPD. 
The study was probably underpowered to achieve stat- 
istically significant improvement in the primary outcome 
of CRQ Dyspnea (breathlessness) when compared to an 
active control group (P ¼ .062). However, we found a 
significant improvement in CRQ Dyspnea in a within- 
group analysis was improved at 8 weeks and that 
improvement was maintained at 17 weeks (8 weeks after 
finishing the intervention) (P ¼ .01) (Table 3). The CRQ 
Mastery domain also improved significantly after the 
intervention (P ¼ .047) and was maintained at 17 weeks 
(P < .001) in this within-group analysis, further support- 
ing the significant

abilities that we believe is clinically important and worth 
reporting.

Self-management, one of the secondary outcomes pro- 
posed, was measured with the SMAS-30 total score and 
improved significantly after the home-based intervention. 
In particular, we noted improvement in the domains Taking 
Initiative and Investment Behavior. The latter provides a 
novel mechanistic understanding of the effect of the home- 
based intervention on self-management abilities. The 
Taking Initiative domain is in line with self-efficacy beliefs 
and adds the individual’s power to control his or her goals 
and next steps. This domain reflects a proactive and 
self-reflecting ability that empowers taking action. The 
Investment Behavior domain refers to the ability to dedi- 
cate time and action planning to achieve stability and main- 
tenance of resources for the long-term management of 
chronic illness. It relates to the uncertainty of how life may 
unfold and that Investment Behavior may help future well-

“Well it was always reassuring that I do have somebody that cared and that would talk to me whatever it was, weekly or ten 
days, I can’t remember what it was. But it was the contact, the interest, and my interest and theirs. I mean, it was a team.

“I kind of wish it was longer. I was kind of sad when it was over because it’s kind of like having a full-time babysitter. And 
you’ve got to remember, I’m 67 years old, so I’m of the group that exercise is a four-letter word. I mean, we don’t do

being. Our findings on Taking Initiative and Investment 
Behavior domains not only provide insights on the effect of 
the intervention on self-management abilities but also may 
interventions or 
represent 
health coaching in COPD. Our findings confirm and extend 
previous results on empowerment and increased self-effi- 
cacy after home-based interventions.32-34 

Health coaching in this study may have been a key ele- 
ment in promoting self-efficacy in managing COPD and 
was added with that very purpose: to increase self-manage- 
ment abilities consistent with our previous findings in 
COPD subjects.35,36 

The WAI-SR mean total scores were high, with 85% of 
maximum scores indicating a high degree of engagement 
between the health coach and the subjects. Our results fur- 
ther suggest that the engagement between the subjects and 
the health coach expressed in the WAI-SR is associated 
with clinical outcomes; ie, the improvement of the task 
domain of the WAI-SR was associated with improve- 
ment of fatigue, the second most important outcome in 
COPD.37 Previous data suggest that a therapeutic alliance 
correlates with positive treatment outcomes38,39; the alli- 
ance between the patient and the health coach can be 
measured and appears to be strongly associated with the 
patient’s adherence to and satisfaction with treatment.40 A 
review by Martin et al41 concluded that the overall relation 
of the therapeutic alliance with the outcome is moderate but 
consistent. Measuring a working alliance may represent a 
desirable outcome to measure in-home health coaching 
programs. 
Our qualitative analysis found high subject acceptability 
with this program, which is consistent with the adherence 
rates that we observed. An important aspect of the program is 
that we were able to document objective compliance by 
reviewing the sessions captured by the system, which pro- 
vided an accurate assessment of compliance to the interven- 
tion in contrast to self-reporting, which can have a significant 
bias. 
The intervention lacked improvement in daily physical 
activity, a very significant knowledge gap in COPD as it is 
unclear in currently available evidence how to improve 
physical activity in individuals with COPD.42 Further, we 
acknowledge that the intensity of the program was not as 
recommended by guidelines; however, we believe that, for 
unsupervised home-based programs, like the one tested, 
new guidelines are needed to ensure the safety of partici- 
pants. We feel that our results inform the current under- 
standing of home-based programs, particularly in view of 
the high adherence and improvement in self-management 
abilities. 
Results from our qualitative study on subjects who 
completed the intervention suggest their preference for a 
longer intervention to increase the chance of making a dif- 
ference in physical activity. Our analytic results on safety 
(ie, no falls or adverse events) are novel and important; 
this is the first report of this magnitude (> 6,000 docu- 
mented sessions) on safety for a home-based program. 
The lack of a significant effect on CRQ Dyspnea (primary 
outcome) after the program ended may suggest an ineffec- 
tive intervention; however, we achieved a trend toward 



statistical significance (P ¼ .06), and, in our qualitative- 
quantitative triangulation, subjects reflected a sense of 
improvement in breathlessness despite the lack of a rigid 
statistically significant improvement in CRQ Dyspnea. 
Subjects also reported the need for a longer program that 
may have had a stronger effect on the quality of life out- 
comes after the intervention. 
The implementation aspect of this project may be signifi- 
cant. The system used is compliant with billing for remote 
patient monitoring ICD codes (CMS CPT 99453, 99454, 
99457, and 99458), which would make the program bill- 
able, once it is proved to be efficacious. 

This study has a number of limitations. First, we did not 
measure exercise capacity. We intentionally planned an 
intervention that may not have the subjects come to the med- 
ical center; we obtained all measures by mail (ie, question- 
naires and activity monitors), which helped tremendously 
with compliance and acceptance to participate. We also 
found this approach useful in implementing this research 
intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, 
future research should consider remote assessments of func- 
tional capacity, particularly during the COVID-19 era.43 The 
lack of health care utilization outcomes is also a limitation of 
this feasibility study. These elements are being tested in a 
current research project (RO1 HL 140486, ClinicalTrials. 
gov registration NCT03480386). 
In addition, we are unable to define the contribution of 
each component of the intervention (ie, health coaching vs 
home-based rehabilitation with technology) to the improve- 
ments observed. However, we hypothesize that both com- 
ponents had additive, if not synergistic, effects. We also 
cannot affirm the strength of the positive findings, either 
maintenance of benefits or improvements observed in the 
trajectory analysis in the intervention group only, 8 weeks 
after finishing the home-based PR with health coaching 
intervention as we did not compare to the control group 
that was compassionately offered the intervention after the 
end of the control period. We also did not conduct the qual- 
itative analysis with subjects who withdrew during the 
intervention, so we may have missed additional feedback. 
We acknowledge that the testing period may have been 
not long enough, which may account for the modest results 
reported. Subjects interviewed in the qualitative study 
stated the willingness for a longer program, which may 
have had a stronger effect on the outcomes after the inter- 
vention. We are now testing a longer 12-week intervention, 
which has greater focus on adjusting weekly steps goals 
based on recent evidence of significant improvement in 
physical activity based on semi-automated adjustment of 
weekly step goals.44 Finally, we did not have subjects with 
mild COPD in this group, however those are not the 
patients that are prevalent in rehabilitation programs as 
they are minimally limited. 

We believe that this mixed-methods feasibility study rep- 
resents a step forward in our understanding of home-based 
programs in COPD patients and may represent the scientific 
foundation for the design of future home-based interven- 
tions. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and high ad- 
herence to the tested home-based program with health 
coaching intervention that improved self-management abil- 
ities and may improve dyspnea and overall quality of life. 
We provide valuable mechanistic information on aspects of 
self-management that may help fill the knowledge gap in 
the science of behavior change in COPD and home-based 
self-management programs.
