Background: Earlier detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations may facilitate more rapid 
treatment with reduced risk of hospitalization. Changes in pulse oximetry may permit early detection of exacerbations. We 
hypothesized that overnight pulse oximetry would be superior to once-daily monitoring for the early detection of exacerbations. 
Objective: This study aims to evaluate whether measuring changes in heart rate and oxygen saturation overnight is superior to 
once-daily monitoring of both parameters and to assess symptom changes in facilitating earlier detection of COPD exacerbations. 
Methods: A total of 83 patients with COPD were randomized to once-daily or overnight pulse oximetry. Both groups completed 
the COPD assessment test questionnaire daily. The baseline mean and SD for each pulse oximetry variable were calculated from 
14 days of stable monitoring. Changes in exacerbation were expressed as Z scores from this baseline. 
Results: The mean age of the patients was 70.6 (SD 8.1) years, 52% (43/83) were female, and the mean FEV1 was 53.0% (SD 
18.5%) predicted. Of the 83 patients, 27 experienced an exacerbation. Symptoms were significantly elevated above baseline from 
5 days before to 12 days after treatment initiation. Day-to-day variation in pulse oximetry during the stable state was significantly 
less in the overnight group than in the once-daily group. There were greater relative changes at exacerbation in heart rate than 
oxygen saturation. An overnight composite score of change in heart rate and oxygen saturation changed significantly from 7 days 
before initiation of treatment for exacerbation and had a positive predictive value for exacerbation of 91.2%. However, this was 
not statistically better than examining changes in symptoms alone. 
Conclusions: Overnight pulse oximetry permits earlier detection of COPD exacerbations compared with once-daily monitoring. 
Monitoring physiological variables was not superior to monitoring symptoms, and the latter would be a simpler approach, except 
where there is a need for objective verification of exacerbations.

Background 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major 
global health problem. The World Health Organization estimated 
the global prevalence in 2016 to be 251 million cases, and 
COPD is ranked as the fifth leading cause of death [1]. COPD 
is predicted to become the third most common cause of death 
by 2030 [2]. Individuals with COPD experience acute 
deteriorations in respiratory health called exacerbations [3], 
which profoundly affect quality of life and can lead to hospital 
admission [4]. Prevention and mitigation of exacerbations is a 
key goal in managing COPD. One method that might improve 
COPD outcomes is the early identification of exacerbations. 
Prompt access to therapy at exacerbation onset is associated 
with faster symptom recovery [5]. Delay in accessing care may 
be because of the difficulty in differentiating day-to-day 
symptom variations from exacerbations [6]. Therefore, there 
has been interest in the utility of monitoring physiological 
variables to support the earlier detection of exacerbations [7]. 
Early objective identification of exacerbations would also be 
of value in research. 
The utility of measuring physiological variables to detect COPD 
exacerbations remains unclear [8]. In our 2010 pilot study, we 
combined daily monitoring of symptoms, heart rate, and oxygen 
saturation [9]. A composite score created from these variables 
changed significantly just before exacerbation onset and could 
be used to monitor recovery. Measurements of heart rate and 
oxygen saturation in this study were taken once daily, and 
one-off readings could be affected by non–exacerbation-related 
factors such as exercise, medication, and anxiety. We 
hypothesized that monitoring patients’ pulse oximetry overnight 
and removing the effects of non–exacerbation-related factors 
would provide earlier exacerbation detection. 
Objectives 
This study aims to evaluate whether measuring changes in heart 
rate and oxygen saturation overnight is superior to once-daily 
monitoring of both parameters and to assess symptom changes 
in facilitating earlier detection of COPD exacerbations. 

Participants and Recruitment 
Participants in COPD clinics and pulmonary rehabilitation 
classes were approached between September 2016 and January 
2018 at 3 different sites in London, United Kingdom. Ethical 
approval was obtained from the local committee at the Royal 
Free Hospital and the UK Health Research Authority 
(16/LO/1120). The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT03003702). All the participants provided written informed 
consent. The inclusion criteria were a confirmed diagnosis of 
COPD (smoking history ≥10 pack years and postbronchodilator 
forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity 
FEV1/FVC<0.7), one or more self-reported moderate or severe 
COPD exacerbations in the previous 12 months, and the ability 
to use study equipment and attend appointments. The exclusion 
criteria were an existing diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
(either self-reported or resulting from STOP-Bang or Epworth 
questionnaires [10,11]) and significant comorbidity preventing 
participation (such as poor peripheral perfusion). 
Study Procedures 
At recruitment, we collected demographic and clinical data and 
performed postbronchodilator spirometry (FEV1 and FVC). 
Subjects were randomized using sealed envelopes; each 
envelope contained a card indicating once-daily or overnight 
measurement. The researcher instructed the participants on how 
to use the pulse oximetry equipment based on their allocation 
wristband pulse oximeter (Nonin 3150) for overnight monitoring 
(measurement recorded every 4s), or finger pulse oximeter 
(Nonin G92) for once-daily (morning) monitoring. Patients 
were also instructed on the use of a peak expiratory flow (PEF) 
meter and the Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment 
test (CAT) questionnaire, and how to record the results on a 
diary card. Subjects were monitored for 6 months or until they 
recovered from the first exacerbation (whichever was earlier). 
Data recorded in the first week were not included in the analysis. 
During the subsequent 2 weeks (the stable state), participants 
were closely monitored to ensure they were using the equipment 
properly and recording data accurately. Participants were then 
instructed to call the researcher if they developed an 
exacerbation or if they developed any medical problem resulting 
in hospitalization. Monitoring was continued through the 
exacerbation until clinical recovery, at which point the 
equipment was returned and participation was complete. The 
equipment was removed, and the study was completed for any 
participant who did not develop an exacerbation within 6 
months. In the absence of an exacerbation, in-person visits were 
scheduled at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. An exacerbation 
was defined as the need for oral corticosteroids or antibiotics, 
as judged by the patient’s clinician or self-management plan. 

At the end of the study, a 10-question acceptability survey was 
administered 
the overnight 
monitoring group to evaluate their acceptance of continuous 
overnight pulse oximetry monitoring. The questionnaire covered 
willingness to use the monitoring equipment, effect on sleep 
quality, and convenience of the device. The highest possible 
score was 90 (the higher the score, the greater the acceptance). 

Pulse Oximeter 
Participants allocated to the overnight monitoring (Nonin3150 
pulse oximeter) group were instructed to wear the device at 
night before sleeping and to remove it as soon as they woke up 
(confirmed by the daily date and time stamp from the device 
and then compared with the date on the diary card). 
Participants allocated to the once-daily (morning) monitoring 
(Nonin G92 pulse oximeter) group were instructed to take their 
measurements before morning medication, after 10 min of rest, 
and with the measurement recorded after 10 seconds of using 
the device. 
The accuracies of Nonin G92 and Nonin 3150 were assessed 
by the manufacturer. The devices comply with ISO 80601-2-61 
and have a stated accuracy of 70% to 100% SpO2 (SD 2%) 
[12,13].

Power Calculation 
The primary outcome was the difference in time to receive 
treatment from symptoms (CAT score) exceeding baseline 
compared with pulse oximetry exceeding baseline. A power 
calculation based on 2 previous data sets [11,14] suggested that 
64 patients with COPD were required to capture 44 COPD 
exacerbations. 
Statistical Analysis 
Data collected from each participant were reviewed by a 
respiratory therapist. Participants who had less than 2 weeks of 
data during the stable state were excluded from the analysis. 
Participants with 2 or more consecutive days of missing data 
during the preexacerbation phase (2 weeks before exacerbation) 
were excluded. Normally distributed data are reported as mean 
(SD) and nonparametric data as median (IQR). Groups were 
compared using the t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Chi-square 
test as appropriate, and relationships between variables were 
assessed using the Pearson or Spearman Rank coefficient. 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis tests were 
used to assess the differences between 3 different periods (stable 
state, preexacerbation treatment, and post exacerbation). The 
baseline (stable state) for each patient was set by calculating 
the mean and SD over 2 weeks for each variable (average for 
each day for 14 days). Data were converted to Z score values 
by subtracting each measure (average per day [X]) from the 
corresponding mean baseline value (x ) and dividing by the 
baseline SD as follows: 
. Any variable outside the 
95% CI of the baseline mean (1.96 SD) was considered 
statistically significant at P<.05. 
We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive 
values by examining changes in heart rate, oxygen saturation, 
and peak flow in a second 2-week period when the patient was 
stable (not the same stable period as used to calculate the 
baseline). 
The acceptability score is presented as mean (SD). Univariate 
and multivariate linear regression analyses were applied to 
identify patient characteristics associated with the acceptability 
of overnight home pulse oximetry. 

Patient Characteristics 
The study flowchart is shown in Figure 1. In total, we 
approached 186 patients with COPD for participation in the 
study, and 47.3% (88/186) agreed. Thus, 88 patients with COPD 
were recruited and randomized to either the once daily or 
continuous overnight monitoring groups. Of the 88 patients, 5 
patients from the overnight group were subsequently excluded 
from the study because they later required oxygen therapy or 
were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. Overall, 16 and 
18 patients, respectively, in the overnight and once-daily groups 
completed follow-up, with 13 and 14 exacerbations available 
for analysis, respectively. 
The baseline characteristics of the 83 patients who received 
their allocated intervention are presented in Table 1. The mean 
age was 70.6 (SD 8.1) years, 52% (43/83) were female, and the 
mean percentage FEV1 was 53.0% (SD 18.5%). A majority of 
the patients were ex-smokers 77% (64/83). The median (IQR) 
number of COPD exacerbations within the past 12 months was 
2.0 (1.0- 3.0). We had a higher-than-anticipated dropout rate of 
59%, as discussed below. Table 1 also reports the baseline data 
from the 27 patients in whom exacerbations were successfully 
monitored. No statistically significant differences were found 
between the once-daily and the overnight groups, suggesting 
that the groups were similar at baseline. The successfully 
monitored participants were also generally similar to the patients 
who had dropped out of the study.

Changes in Symptoms at Exacerbation of COPD 
First, we examined changes in the CAT score to understand the 
symptom changes during exacerbations. Both groups measured 
the CAT score once each day, and therefore the data from both 
groups were combined. Figure 2 shows the CAT score from 2 
weeks before exacerbation (day −1 to day −14), day 0 (defined 
as the start of treatment), and for 2 weeks subsequently, as the 
patient recovered (day 1 to day 13). Day −15 on the graph 
represents the mean of the stable period (2 weeks baseline 
monitoring, as described above). 
The mean CAT score for the 27 patients with COPD at baseline 
was 15.6 (SD 0.4) points. Any score greater than or equal to 
1.96 SD units away from the mean was considered statistically 
significant at P<.05. Figure 2 demonstrates that the CAT score 
crossed this statistical threshold from day −5 and did not return 
to baseline on day 13. The increase in CAT score was greatest 
on day 0 (the day of treatment initiation), with a maximum 
change of +6.2 SD (=7 points). 
The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the 
CAT questionnaire is 2 points. The mean CAT score for the 27 
patients with COPD increased above the MCID from day −5 
(=18.3 points) to day 12 (=18.2 points). The difference in mean 
CAT scores between the 3 phases was statistically significant 
(stable state=15.6 points, pre exacerbation=17.4 points, post 
exacerbation=19.7 points, P<.001). Thus, patients had 
statistically and clinically elevated CAT scores from 5 days 
before receiving treatment for exacerbation to 12 days after 
treatment initiation. The variability of CAT score increased 
before exacerbation compared with baseline (SD 2.34 vs 1.46, 
P=.004). From this, we concluded that the exacerbations we 
detected had been associated with significant changes in 
symptoms and that it was appropriate to go on and examine 
changes in PEF and pulse oximetry.

in 27 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The y-axis represents Z score relative to the patient’s baseline mean. The x-axis represents 
the time expressed in days. Day −15 is the mean of the stable period, days −14 to −1 is the preexacerbation period, day 0 is the day of initiation of 
treatment for exacerbation, and days 1 to 13 is the postexacerbation recovery period. The red lines represent the threshold limits of ±1.96 SD. 
Changes in PEF at Exacerbation of COPD 
Next, we examined changes in PEF to confirm that changes in 
symptoms were associated with changes in lung function. The 
mean PEF for the 27 patients with COPD (both groups) at 
baseline was 214 (SD 3.7) Lmin-1. As illustrated in Figure 2, 
the PEF decreased gradually before 
treatment of 
exacerbation and fell below 1.96 SD between day 0 and day 4, 
with the maximal change at day +1. 

ANOVA analysis demonstrated a statistically (but not clinically) 
significant difference in PEF between the 3 different phases 
(stable state=213.8 Lmin-1, pre exacerbation=201.6 Lmin-1, post 
exacerbation=198.0 Lmin-1, P=.001). Post hoc, the differences 
were significant between the stable phase vs preexacerbation 
periods (P=.02) and stable vs postexacerbation periods (P=.002). 
There was no difference in PEF variability between the stable 
and preexacerbation phases (13.81 vs 15.54 Lmin-1, P=.49). 
In summary, the exacerbations we captured were associated 
with typical changes in symptoms and PEF. We next went on 
to examine changes in the variables monitored differently 
between the 2 groups: heart rate and oxygen saturation. 
Changes in Heart Rate at Exacerbation of COPD 
Figure 3 shows the heart rate changes in the once-daily group 
(n=14) and the overnight group (n=13). The mean stable heart 
rate for the once-daily group was 77.1 (SD 3.6) beats min-1. At 
no point did changes in heart rate in the once-daily group cross 
the threshold of greater or less than 1.96 SD units away from 
the stable mean. The maximum change occurred at day −1 (SD 
1.7), representing an increase of 7 beats min-1. An ANOVA test 
showed a statistically (but not clinically) significant difference 
between the 3 periods (stable state=77.1 beats min-1, pre 
exacerbation=76.7 beats min-1, post exacerbation=81.2 beats 
min-1, P=.007). The difference was significant between post 
exacerbation vs the stable phase (P=.02) and post exacerbation 
vs pre exacerbation (P=.01). In the once daily group, the 
variability (SD) in heart rate did not differ between the baseline 
and preexacerbation phases (4.50 vs 5.50, P=.28). 
The mean heart rate for the overnight group in the stable period 
was 70.0 (SD 1.8) beats min-1. When compared with the 
once-daily group, the stable state SD in the overnight group 
was significantly smaller (1.8 vs 3.6 min-1P<.001). In the 
overnight group, the heart rate did cross the significance 
threshold and was consistently above this from day −5 to day 
0 with a maximal increase of 10 beats min-1 (at day −4, 
equivalent to 3.95 SD). There was a significant difference 
between the 3 periods (stable state=70.0 min-1, pre exacerbation= 
73.9 min-1, post exacerbation=67.6 min-1, P=.001). The 
difference was significant between the preexacerbation period 
versus the stable state and preexacerbation vs postexacerbation 
phase (P=.04 and P=.001, respectively). Heart rate variability 
was statistically higher in the preexacerbation phase compared 
with baseline (7.00 vs 4.01 min-1, P=.04).

score relative to the patient’s baseline mean. The x-axis represents the time expressed in days. Day −15 is the mean of the stable period, days −14 to

line represents the threshold limit of +1.96 SD. The once-daily group is represented by the green line and the overnight group by the blue line. 
Changes in Oxygen Saturation at Exacerbation of 
COPD 
We next examined trends in oxygen saturation through the time 
course of an exacerbation. Figure 4 shows the SpO2% variability 
in the once-daily measurement group (n=14) and the overnight 
measurement group (n=13). The mean oxygen saturation during 
the stable period in the once-daily group was 94.0% (SD 0.81%). 
SpO2% variability remained within the stable range in the 
once-daily group with a maximum reduction of −1.80 SD (−2%) 
at day −1. There was no significant difference between the 3 
periods (stable state=94.0%, pre exacerbation=93.9%, post 
exacerbation=93.2%, P=.09). Variability 
the oxygen 
saturation signal between the stable and preexacerbation phases 
was not statistically significant (1.12 vs 1.53%, P=.13). 

The mean oxygen saturation in the stable phase in the overnight 
group was 91.0% (SD 0.36%). When compared with the 
once-daily group, the stable state SD in the overnight group 
was smaller (0.36 vs 0.81% P=.002). The SpO2% decreased 
more than 1.96 SD in the overnight group on 3 days: −7, −6, 
and −1 (−1.93 SD, −2.04 SD, and −2.25 SD, respectively), 
equivalent to a maximal reduction of 1.2%, but these changes 
did not occur over a consistent period. The means of the 3 phases 
(stable, 91.0%; pre exacerbation, 91.0%; and post exacerbation, 
91.3%) were not statistically significant (P=.26) or clinically 
different. The variability (SD) of the oxygen saturation signal 
in the overnight group was not significantly different in the 
preexacerbation phase compared with baseline (1.13% vs 1.01%, 
P=.58).

the Z score relative to the patient’s baseline mean. The x-axis represents the time expressed in days. Day −15 is the mean of the stable period, days −14 
to −1 is the preexacerbation period, day 0 is the day of initiation of treatment for exacerbation, and days 1 to 13 is the postexacerbation recovery. The 
red line represents the threshold limit of +1.96 SD. The once-daily group is represented by the green line and the overnight group by the blue line. 
Changes in a Composite Oximetry Score at 
Exacerbation of COPD 
We have previously demonstrated that an exacerbation is 
typically associated with unidirectional changes in the pulse 
oximetry signal, specifically an increase in heart rate and a 
decrease in oxygen saturation, and demonstrated that a 
composite oximetry score calculated as (ZHR–ZSPO2) performs 
better at detecting changes at exacerbation than either variable 
alone [15]. Therefore, we proceeded to calculate this score for 
both groups. Figure 5 shows the composite score for the 
once-daily group (n=14) and the overnight group (n=13). In the 
once daily group, the composite score increased more than 1.96 
SD away from the baseline mean on day −1 and day 0, with a 
maximum change of 3.58 SD at day −1. In contrast, in the 
overnight group, the composite score crossed the threshold 
consistently between days −7 and day 0, with a maximum 
change of 6.11 SD on day −1. 
The composite score crossed the threshold for abnormality in 
11 of 13 patients during the 2 weeks before the exacerbation. 
While examining the same patients in a 2-week period when 
stable, the score became abnormal at some point in 3 of 11 
patients. Thus, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive 
value of the score in detecting an exacerbation were 84.6%, 
81.8%, and 91.7%, respectively. A summary of the results is 
provided in Table 2.

Time Difference to Exacerbation Between Symptoms 
and Physiology 
Our prespecified primary analysis was used to assess the time 
difference to initiate treatment from when a change in symptoms 
(CAT) was first statistically different from baseline compared 
with changes in physiological variables (PEF, HR, SpO2, and 
composite score). First, we combined both groups to assess the 
difference between symptoms and PEF (n=27) and found no 
difference between the groups. The median (IQR) time to 
receive treatment from symptoms becoming abnormal was 2.0 
(0-10) days, whereas for PEF, it was 0.5 (0-5) days (P=.15). 
The results for the differences between symptoms and 
physiological variables in the once daily and overnight groups 
are reported in Table 3. None of the pulse oximetry monitoring 
approaches were superior to the use of CAT alone.

Finally, we compared the time between change in physiological 
signal becoming abnormal and receiving treatment between the 
2 different monitoring groups. The results are reported in Table 
4. There was a statistically significant difference in time between 
the overnight group and the once-daily group for heart rate 
(median 5 [0.5-7.5] days vs 0 [0-0.5] days, P=.03), but not for 
the other variables or composite score. This demonstrates that 
where objective verification of exacerbation is required, 
overnight monitoring of heart rate has the greatest potential to 
detect or assist in the detection of exacerbations of COPD and 
is significantly better than once-daily measurement.

Patients’ Acceptance of Overnight Continuous Pulse 
Oximetry Monitoring 
A total of 29 participants completed the acceptability 
questionnaire, with a response rate of 97%. Overall, patients 
had moderate acceptability, with a mean score of 59.8/90 (12.6). 
Univariate linear regression showed that patients who had a 
higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score and those who were 
living alone had higher acceptability (β=.453 P=.01, and β=.424 
P=.02, respectively); thus, acceptability was higher in frailer 
patients (in whom this technology may potentially be most 
beneficial). 

We conducted a randomized trial to compare the ability of 
overnight vs once daily monitoring of pulse oximetry to provide 
earlier detection of COPD exacerbations and to assessment of 
changes in symptoms and PEF. Early detection of exacerbations 
is important because it could facilitate prompt access to therapy, 
with faster resolution of exacerbations and decreased risk of 
hospitalization [5]. Our central hypothesis was that monitoring 
remove 
overnight 
non–exacerbation-related effects from the oximetry signal and, 
therefore, be more effective. 



Our key findings are, first, that the time to treatment initiation 
from changes in symptoms vs changes in pulse oximetry first 
becoming abnormal were not statistically significant. However, 
patients waited an average of 5 days before treatment, and 
therefore, objectively monitoring symptoms or use of overnight 
oximetry may prompt patients to seek attention. Second, 
overnight measurement of heart rate may permit earlier detection 
of exacerbations compared with once-daily measurement 
because the SD of the stable state mean is smaller, permitting 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
detection of smaller changes (increased signal-to-noise ratio). 
Third, changes in heart rate were more useful than changes in 
oxygen saturation or PEF. Finally, a combined oximetry score 
calculated by subtracting the Z score of change in oxygen 
saturation from the Z score of change in heart rate had a positive 
predictive value over 90% for the detection of exacerbation. 
The findings of this pilot study support our hypothesis that 
nocturnal pulse oximetry could facilitate earlier objective 
detection of COPD exacerbations. 
Respiratory Symptoms 
COPD exacerbations are defined by a change in respiratory 
symptoms above the day-to-day variation [16]. Seemungal was 
the first to report that symptoms changed significantly during 
the seven-day period preceding an exacerbation [6]. Aaron et 
al [17] went on to describe two patterns of exacerbation 
symptom onset. Our findings also show that symptoms increased 
above baseline 5 days before the treatment of exacerbation. In 
our study, we used the CAT questionnaire to assess symptom 
severity. A previous study by Lee et al investigated the use of 
the CAT questionnaire in the prediction of COPD exacerbations 
[3] and was able to identify patients at risk of developing an 
exacerbation (area under the curve=0.83). A 2-point change in 
CAT is clinically significant [18]. Previous studies have shown 
that the mean CAT score increased above 2 points from baseline 
at the onset of exacerbation [19]. Our findings are consistent 
with this, as the mean CAT score in our study increased above 
baseline by more than 2 points from 5 days before initiation of 
treatment for exacerbation. However, although the CAT 
questionnaire is an objective tool for assessment of symptoms, 
each question is answered based on patients’ self-perception, 
and there remains no objective way to confirm or exclude an 
exacerbation.

Physiological Variables 
In our study, we monitored 3 physiological variables: PEF, heart 
rate, and oxygen saturation. The evidence for using 
physiological parameters 
is 
to 
controversial, reflecting the poor quality of existing studies [7]. 
The approach used in previous studies was generally once-daily 
monitoring, and few studies have reported the magnitude of 
change in physiological variables (which is essential to define 
alarm limits in clinical practice). We studied two different 
monitoring approaches and examined differences in day-to-day 
variation in physiological parameters during 3 different phases 
(stable, pre exacerbation, and post exacerbation). We show that 
for heart rate and PEF, but not oxygen saturation, the mean 
value during the preexacerbation phase was significantly 
different from that during the stable phase. In addition, 
variability in the heart rate signal increased as patients first 
became unwell. These findings support the hypothesis that 
in 
COPD exacerbations are associated with changes 
cardiorespiratory physiology and that monitoring these variables 
may facilitate the earlier identification of exacerbations. 
PEF is a simple tool to assess lung function, and measurements 
of PEF correlate with FEV1 [20,21]. The PEF in our study 
decreased during 
the preexacerbation phase and was 
significantly lower than baseline on the day of initiation of 
treatment for exacerbation. The maximum decrease in PEF 
during the exacerbation was 34 Lmin-1. Seemungal et al reported 
that PEF decreased below baseline at exacerbation with a median 
change of 6.6 Lmin-1 [22]. In another study conducted by this 
group, PEF decreased significantly from baseline on the day of 
exacerbation with a median change of 8.6 Lmin-1 [6]. Even 
though these changes are statistically significant, a decrease in 
PEF of this magnitude is not clinically significant and is not 
accurately measurable with current PEF devices. There is no 
accepted MCID for PEF at exacerbation of COPD. 
Heart rate and oxygen saturation in our study were monitored 
once daily (in the morning) or continuously overnight. Our 
findings show that the mean heart rate in both groups increased 
significantly during the preexacerbation phase compared with 
the stable state. In the overnight group, the heart rate crossed 
the significance threshold from day −5 for 5 consecutive days. 
The mean heart rate in the once-daily group increased by 7 
min-1, consistent with results from other studies [9,23]. The 
maximum increase in heart rate in the overnight group was 10 
min-1. Importantly, and as we had hypothesized, the variation 
of heart rate in the overnight group was smaller compared with 
the variation in the once-daily group (SD 1.8 vs 3.6 min-1), 
which supports the hypothesis that overnight monitoring of 
heart rate might enhance the detection of exacerbations by 
improving the signal-to-noise ratio. 
The use of oxygen saturation to support detection and 
monitoring recovery of community-treated COPD exacerbations 
has been previously examined. In a pilot study, we reported that 
oxygen saturation decreased by a mean of 1.2% 2 days into the 
exacerbation [9]. Other studies have reported that oxygen 
saturation decreased 1 to 3 days before exacerbation onset by 
1% to 2% [23-25]. In our study, the mean oxygen saturation in 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
the once-daily group decreased by 2% 1 day before 
exacerbation. In contrast, the oxygen saturation of the overnight 
group had decreased by 1.2% for several days before the onset 
of the exacerbation. The variation in the overnight group 
(±0.36%) was less than that in the once-daily group (±0.81%), 
which again would increase the potential to detect changes at 
exacerbation of COPD. However, it should be noted that these 
changes are small in magnitude and within the measurement 
error of the device. 
Pulse Oximetry 
We hypothesized that a continuous overnight monitoring 
approach might help in earlier detection of COPD exacerbations 
by eliminating non–exacerbation-related influences on the pulse 
oximetry signal, such as that from exercise, medication, and 
anxiety. We acknowledge that changes in heart rate and oxygen 
saturation with exercise may provide an alternative approach 
for the early detection of exacerbations, but our study was not 
designed to examine this. 
Although our data suggested that monitoring pulse oximetry 
may help in early identification of exacerbations, there remains 
a need to prospectively test an algorithm that could be 
implemented in telehealth systems. We have shown that 
combining two variables in a combined oximetry score increases 
the potential to detect changes earlier, with sensitivity, 
specificity, and positive predictive value that would be clinically 
valuable. Our composite score crossed the significance threshold 
in both groups but was superior in the overnight group. The 
score in the overnight group crossed the threshold for 7 days 
before the treatment was initiated in the patient. The monitoring 
of heart rate and oxygen saturation in COPD telehealth services 
is widespread. In a cross-sectional survey on the use of telehealth 
in COPD, heart rate and oxygen saturation were the variables 
most commonly monitored, but there was no standardized 
method for detecting changes and thus defining alarm limits 
[26]. Consequently, tele-health users report a high frequency 
of false alarms. In a previous systematic review, we reported 
that the majority of telehealth studies were taking measurements 
intermittently [7]. This approach might not be optimal for using 
pulse oximetry to detect exacerbations as the signal might be 
affected by external factors such as exercise, medication, and 
anxiety. We have shown that overnight monitoring of heart rate 
and oxygen saturation permits the detection of changes earlier 
than once-daily monitoring. 
Although symptoms changed as early as physiological variables, 
patients do not routinely quantify symptoms in relation to their 
own baseline, and therefore, objective monitoring has potential 
benefits in the context of both clinical practice and research 
(avoiding missing unreported exacerbations, increasing event 
rates, and thus, requiring fewer patients to meet an exacerbation 
end point). 
We found that living alone and the presence of comorbidities 
may be associated with higher acceptance of overnight 
monitoring. Previous studies have shown patients’ willingness 
to use home monitoring devices if they thought it would benefit 
their condition [27].

To our knowledge, this is the first study to monitor patients with 
COPD overnight to support earlier detection of exacerbations. 
We measured the pulse rate and oxygen saturation every 4 
seconds, which reduced day-to-day variability 
the 
measurement signal compared with once-daily monitoring. A 
significant limitation in our study was the higher-than-expected 
dropout rate. We believe this was because the equipment used 
in the overnight group was not designed for this purpose, 
patients lost interest in the study, and there was no real-time 
interaction with the health care provider with regard to their 
measurements. Although these factors are modifiable, we did 
not detect the number of exacerbations required to satisfy our 

power calculation, and therefore, the results are best considered 
as a pilot. Our findings have shown the potential for pulse 
oximetry to assist in the early detection of exacerbations, but 
we cannot draw a stronger conclusion about the efficacy because 
of the small number of exacerbations captured. 
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that overnight pulse 
oximetry could facilitate earlier objective detection of COPD 
exacerbations. Overnight pulse oximetry allowed earlier 
detection compared with once-daily monitoring. Heart rate was 
superior to oxygen saturation and PEF and combining heart rate 
and oxygen saturation data provided the best performance.
