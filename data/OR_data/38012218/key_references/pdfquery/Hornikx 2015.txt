counseling program after an exacerbation 
in patients with Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease: a randomized 
controlled pilot study 
Miek Hornikx1, Heleen Demeyer2, Carlos Augusto Camillo2, Wim Janssens2 and Thierry Troosters2* 

Background: In some patients with COPD, the disease is characterized by exacerbations. Severe exacerbations 
warrant a hospitalization, with prolonged detrimental effects on physical activity. Interventions after an exacerbation 
may improve physical activity, with longstanding health benefits. Physical activity counseling and real-time feedback 
were effective in stable COPD. No evidence is available on the use of this therapeutic modality in patients after a 
COPD exacerbation. 
Methods: Thirty patients were randomly assigned to usual care or physical activity counseling, by telephone 
contacts at a frequency of 3 times a week and real-time feedback. Lung function, peripheral muscle strength, 
functional exercise capacity, symptom experience and COPD-related health status were assessed during hospital 
stay and 1 month later. 
Results: Both groups significantly recovered in physical activity (PAsteps: control group: 1013 ± 1275 steps vs intervention 
group: 984 ± 1208 steps (p = 0.0005); PAwalk: control group: 13 ± 14 min vs intervention group: 13 ± 16 min (p = 0.0002)), 
functional exercise capacity (control group: 64 ± 59 m (p = 0.002) vs intervention group: 67 ± 84 m (p = 0.02)) and COPD- 
related health status (CAT: control group: −5 [−7 to 1] (p = 0.02) vs intervention group: −3 [−10 to 1] points (p = 0.03)). No 
differences between groups were observed. 
Conclusion: From our pilot study, we concluded that telephone based physical activity counseling with pedometer 
feedback after an exacerbation did not result in better improvements in physical activity and clinical outcomes compared 
to usual care. Because of the difficult recruitment and the negative intermediate analyses, this study was not continued.

Background 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is char- 
acterized by exacerbations. These episodes of worsening 
of symptoms beyond the expected daily variation lead to 
substantial morbidity and mortality. Exacerbations accel- 
erate disease progression and they have a negative impact 
on the quality of life of patients [1–5]. Severe exacerba- 
tions of COPD require a hospitalization, imposing a real 
burden on the socioeconomic system [1, 4]. During the 
hospital stay, patients are severely inactive, with a reper- 
cussion on their muscle strength and exercise capacity [6]. 
Physical activity (PA) levels of these patients are below the 
levels found in stable patients with COPD, even 1 month 
after discharge [7]. Immediately after their return home, 
patients experience several barriers to engage in PA, such 
as anxiety for dyspnea, the need for oxygen and environ- 
mental factors such as the weather [8]. Nevertheless, 
sustaining a physically inactive lifestyle increases the 
risk for a new hospital admission [9], increases mor- 
tality rates [9, 10] and has a negative impact on the onset 
and progression of comorbid conditions [11, 12]. These 
findings warrant the measurement and enhancement of 
PA after hospital discharge. So far, studies concentrated 
on formal pulmonary rehabilitation to improve physical 
activity after exacerbations, with inconsistent effects [12]. 
From the 10 studies [13–22] that have been published on 
this topic, 4 studies [17–19, 22] showed an increased level 
of physical activity after pulmonary rehabilitation. Further- 
more, such programs may suffer from poor uptake, adher- 
ence and lack of accessibility [23]. Only 34 % (range 18 to 
67 %) of eligible patients eventually participate in pulmon- 
ary rehabilitation [23–27]. Therefore, there is an urgent 
need for other interventions to promote physical activity 
after an exacerbation. In stable patients with COPD, nor- 
dic walking [28] was investigated and was found to be suc- 
cessful. PA counseling combined with real-time feedback 
has proven its effect in improving PA in healthy subjects 
[29], in patients with heart failure [30, 31], diabetes [11] 
and in stable patients with COPD. The use of the latter 
treatment modality has not been explored in patients im- 
mediately after a hospitalization for an acute exacerbation 
of COPD [32–34]. For this pilot study, we hypothesized 
that, through frequent PA counseling and real-time feed- 
back, patients would potentially increase their PA level 
more rapidly in the month after an exacerbation com- 
pared to subjects in a control group, receiving usual care. 
Methods 
Subjects 
Patients with COPD, hospitalized for an exacerbation of 
COPD were informed about the study and were included 
when the following inclusion criteria were met: 1) Male/ 
female > 40 years of age 2) Diagnosis of COPD, defined as 
FEV1/FVC < 70 % (post-bronchodilation) 3) Hospitalized 
for a COPD exacerbation 4) Ability to work with elec- 
tronic devices. Patients were excluded if they participated 
in pulmonary rehabilitation prior to the index hospital ad- 
mission (and would return to the program after discharge) 
or suffered from a neurological or musculoskeletal disease 
that would prevent them from being active. The protocol 
was approved by the local medical ethics committee from 
the University Hospitals KULeuven and all patients gave 
their written informed consent. 
Sample size calculation 
The sample size calculation was performed using 
G*Power (version 3.1.6). Based on previous research, we 
assumed the intervention group to reach a walking time 
that equals the walking time in stable patients with 
COPD (44 ± 20 min) [35]. The control group was esti- 
mated to achieve 28 ± 20 min of walking time, which 
corresponds to the amount of walking time in patients 
1 month after hospitalization for an exacerbation [7]. 
With a degree of certainty (statistical power) of 80 % 
and a risk for a type I error (α) < 5 %, 26 patients in both 
groups were needed. Considering a drop out rate of 
20 % [34], the total sample size of the study was esti- 
mated at 62 patients with COPD. 
Study design 
Fifty-three patients, hospitalized for an exacerbation in 
the University Hospital of Leuven, were informed about 
the study and eventually 30 patients were willing to par- 
ticipate. Patients were recruited from April 2013 to April 
2014. Eligible patients were randomized (randomization 
rate of 1:1) into usual care or were provided with a ped- 
ometer to provide real-time feedback on physical activity 
and personal, telephone based PA counseling during 
1 month. The intervention started from the moment of 
discharge. After 1 month, all patients were offered the 
opportunity to be enrolled in pulmonary rehabilitation.

Intervention 
Physical activity counseling and real-time feedback 
Physical activity measurement and real-time feed- 
back The Fitbit Ultra® (Fitbit Inc, San Francisco, Califor- 
nia), a pedometer, was used to provide real-time feedback 
based on step counts. Based on a pilot study, we decided 
to clip the Fitbit Ultra® on the right sock in these slowly 
walking patients to pick up a maximal amount of steps. 
Because the Fitbit Ultra® is not validated in COPD, pa- 
tients wore the latter device simultaneously with the 
Dynaport MoveMonitor (McRoberts BV, The Hague, the 
Netherlands), a valid activity monitor in COPD [36] at 3 
time points during the study (during hospital stay, 2 weeks 
after discharge and at the end of the study). 



Physical activity counseling Telephone calls, with a 
frequency of 3 times a week, were used as a means 
to motivate and stimulate patients in the intervention 
group to increase their PA level during 1 month (11 ± 1 
calls/patient on average). The timing of the telephone 
calls was determined in agreement with the patients. 
During these telephone contacts, step counts of the 
previous days were discussed with an experienced 
physiotherapist as well as barriers and opportunities 
for PA. At the end of the telephone call, a new goal 
was agreed for the following days. The goals were set 
individually, with the aim of 
improving the level of 
PA as much as possible during 1 month. Two and 
4 weeks after hospital discharge, a progression report 
including further tips to increase PA was sent by post 
to the patients. 
Usual care 
Patients in the control group did not participate in 
any kind of rehabilitation, were not contacted nor re- 
ceived motivational messages. They were provided 
with advice about increasing PA during the hospital 
stay from a physiotherapist. Two weeks after hospital 
discharge and at the end of the study, patients were 
asked to wear the Dynaport MoveMonitor during 7 
consecutive days. 


Measurements 
Physical activity was the primary outcome of the study 
and was measured during hospital stay, 2 weeks after 
discharge and at the end of the study. Measurements of 
lung function, peripheral muscle strength, functional ex- 
ercise capacity, symptoms of dyspnea and COPD-related 
health status were secondary outcomes of the study and 
were performed during hospital stay (the day before dis- 
charge) and 1 month later, at the end of the study. 
Physical activity 
The measurements were performed with the Dynaport 
MoveMonitor (McRoberts BV, The Hague, the Netherlands). 
This device was recently validated in patients with COPD 
[36]. The Dynaport MoveMonitor is a small (64x62x13mm) 
and lightweight device (68 g, including batteries). Analysis 
of raw data allows for classification of intensity, duration 
and frequency of movement. Different postures and walk- 
ing are identified and energy expenditure is estimated. 
The Dynaport MoveMonitor is inserted in an elastic belt 
and positioned on the lower back at the height of the sec- 
ond lumbar vertebra, nearby the body’s center of mass, ac- 
cording to the instructions of the manufacturer. Data on 
walking time (PAwalk), daily amount of steps (PAsteps) 
and movement intensity during walking (PAint) were used 
for the analyses. 
Lung function 
All patients performed post-bronchodilator spirom- 
etry according to European Respiratory Society and 
American Thoracic Society standards [37]. The re- 
sults were referred to the predicted values reported 
by Quanjer et al. [38]. 



Peripheral muscle strength 
Isometric quadriceps 
strength (QF) was measured 
using a dynamometer (Biodex system 4 pro; Enraf 
Nonius; Delft, The Netherlands). Peak extension torque 
was evaluated at 60° of knee flexion. After a practice 
trial, tests were performed at least 3 times and the 
best result was used for further analyses [18]. Refer- 
ence values for the quadriceps strength were devel- 
oped in our laboratory [39]. 
Functional exercise capacity 
Functional exercise performance was measured by a 
six minutes walking distance test (6MWD) in a 50-m 
corridor. The patients were instructed to walk the lar- 
gest distance as possible during 6 min. Encourage- 
ments were standardized and oxygen saturation and 
heart rate were measured continuously. Patients in- 
cluded in the study were all familiar with the 6MWD. 
For this reason and for not burdening the patients 
too much, only 1 test was executed. Normal values 
were described by Troosters et al. [40]. 
Questionnaires 
Modified medical research council dyspnea scale 
(mMRC) The mMRC dyspnea scale is a questionnaire 
that consists of five statements about perceived breath- 
lessness. Those who grade themselves with a statement 
with a higher score, experience more breathlessness dur- 
ing daily activities [41]. 
COPD assessment test (CAT) The CAT consists of 
eight items, each formatted as a semantic six-point dif- 
ferential scale. The total score is calculated as the sum 
of the responses. The higher the CAT score, the lower 
the overall COPD-related health status. This question- 
naire is valid and reliable to be used in patients with 
COPD [42]. 
Statistical analyses 
We included all evaluable patients in the statistical ana- 
lyses, without excluding patients that were not compli- 
ant. Patients without follow-up data were excluded. 
To check for normality, a Shapiro-Wilk test was applied. 
Data were expressed as mean ± SD in case of normal dis- 
tribution. If the data were not normally distributed, me- 
dian [IQR] were used. To compare continuous data 
between the two study groups an unpaired t-test was ap- 
plied. The comparison of proportions between groups was 
performed using a Chi-Square test. Within group changes 
during 1 month were assessed by means of a paired t-test, 
using delta scores. Physical activity was measured at 3 
time points. To analyze these data, a mixed model re- 
peated measures ANOVA (proc mixed in SAS 9.3) was 
applied and data were corrected for important baseline 
differences.

terms of demographic characteristics. Functional exer- 
cise capacity was low in both the control group and the 
intervention group, but was significantly lower in the 
intervention group compared to the control group. 
PAsteps, PAwalk and PAint indicated an extreme phys- 
ical inactivity at hospital discharge, but were not signifi- 
cantly different between groups. 
Drop out and follow-up completers 
From the intervention group, 2 patients dropped out 
from the study after signing the informed consent. One 
patient was not motivated anymore to take part, while 
the other patient reported transport difficulties. One pa- 
tient from the intervention group deceased during the 
study period. The final analyses were performed includ- 
ing 15 patients in the control group and 12 patients in 
the intervention group. From the 27 patients that com- 
pleted the study, a complete dataset was available. 
Change in physical activity during 1 month 
Figure 3 and Table 2 show the change in physical ac- 
tivity during 1 month. PAsteps and PAwalk signifi- 
cantly increased over time in each group, with no 
differences observed between groups (PAsteps: p = 0.96; 
PAwalk: p = 0.98). The day-by-day pattern of PAsteps 
measured by the Fibit Ultra during the intervention period 
(mean for the whole group) is shown in Fig. 4. 


Change in clinical parameters during 1 month 
Functional 
recovered 
significantly 
within each group 1 month after hospital discharge 
(Δ6MWD: control group: 64 ± 59 m (p = 0.02) vs interven- 
tion group: 67 ± 84 m (p = 0.02)). Physical activity counsel- 
ing did not result in better improvements in functional 
exercise capacity. Muscle strength did not significantly 
change in each group during 1 month and was not influ- 
enced by the type of intervention. The decrease in CAT 
(points) was statistically and clinically [43] significant 
within the 2 study groups (ΔCAT: control group: −5 [−7 
to 1] points (p = 0.02) vs intervention group: −3 [−10 to 1] 
points (p = 0.03)), with no between group effect (Table 3). 
Hospital readmission, medication intake during 1 month 
and enrollment in pulmonary rehabilitation afterwards 
There was no significant difference in the amount of pa- 
tients restarting oral corticosteroids during the study be- 
tween the control group and the intervention group (6 
(40 %) vs 5 (42 %) (p = 0.93)). Six patients (40 %) in the 
control group and 4 patients (33 %) in the intervention 
group were readmitted to the hospital 
for an acute 
COPD exacerbation (p = 0.72) within the 1 month study 
period. Enrollment in pulmonary rehabilitation was lim- 
ited, as only 1 patient (7 %) from the control group and 
3 patients (25 %) from the intervention group partici- 
pated (p = 0.29). 
Discussion and future plans 
To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating an 
alternative for conventional pulmonary rehabilitation 
after an exacerbation to increase physical activity. We 
investigated the use of telephone based physical activity 
counseling and providing patients with a pedometer and 
an agreed physical activity goal 
immediately after a 
hospitalization for an exacerbation. Our study showed a 
spontaneous but limited recovery in PA and clinical out- 
comes. Contrary to our expectations, counseling and 
real-time feedback did not result in better improvements 
compared to the group receiving usual care. Recovery in 
functional exercise capacity and COPD-related health 
status were similar in both groups. The baseline physical 
activity levels of the patients included in our study were 
in line with the study of Pitta et al. [7] and confirm the 
severe and long lasting physical inactivity during hospital 


admission and thereafter. In addition, the data of the ped- 
ometer in the treatment group suggest that recovery is 
gradual in the first 4 days but seems to level off. In contrary 
to our expectations, relative values of peripheral muscle 
strength at baseline were higher than expected in both 
study groups and might be explained by the presence of 
cachexia (BMI < 20 kg/m2) [44] in respectively 2 (13 %) and 
3 (25 %) patients in the control and intervention group. 
PA counseling and real-time feedback have been ap- 
plied more successfully in stable patients with COPD 
[33, 34], in other chronic disease conditions [11, 30, 31] 
and in healthy subjects [29]. Motivational factors, phys- 
ical as well as mental or social barriers to engage in PA 
and hospital readmission are reasons that might explain 
why we were unable to show that PA counseling was ef- 
fective as a treatment modality in these patients. In a re- 
cent study of Greening et al. [26], a first attempt was 
made to investigate an alternative intervention to con- 
ventional pulmonary rehabilitation to improve function 
and PA during or immediately after an exacerbation. 
Early rehabilitation, consisting of exercise and resistance 
training, neuromuscular electrical stimulation and self- 
management was started within 48 h after the exacerba- 
tion and evolved in an unsupervised home-based program 
after hospital discharge. The results of this study were 
comparable with our study and showed a recovery in

function and PA. Early rehabilitation and unsupervised 
home-based training did not result in a better recovery 
compared to usual care. The study of Greening et al. [26] 
therefore confirms that home based interventions to im- 
prove function or PA during or immediately after hospital 
admission for an exacerbation might lack efficacy. Individ- 
ualized pulmonary rehabilitation after an exacerbation 
may be a better approach in patients after an exacerbation. 
We speculate that the current intervention could be an 
alternative for patients that explicitly express a willingness 
to increase PA, but cannot access a pulmonary rehabilita- 
tion program. Motivation to alter PA was not an inclusion 
criterion and unfortunately, motivational aspects were not 
registered in the current study. One of the limitations of 
our study was that we did not take into account “motiv- 
ation to alter PA” as an inclusion criterion and that mo- 
tivational aspects were not registered. Further, we did not 
use a more interactive platform, as was applied by Moy et 
al. [34]. The majority of our patients (70 %), however, did 
not have internet access and although this might rapidly 
change in the future, this seems currently not to be an 
option. We did not have a rewarding system for people 
that effectively increased PA in order to provide extrinsic 
motivation and we did not combine the intervention with 
home visits to overcome practical barriers for physical in- 
activity and to explore concrete solutions with the patient. 
The last limitation of our study was that we did not 
spread the intervention over a longer time window to 
allow a slower continued recovery. The fact that patients 
seemed to stagnate in their PA levels, however, suggests 
that not much further improvements should be expected 
by simply prolonging the present intervention. In order to 
improve the effectiveness of future studies, a rewarding 
system, home visits and the investigation of motivational 
aspects should be implemented. 
Although the low sample size of the present study 
limits the generalizability of the data, we concluded that 
PA counseling immediately after an exacerbation is time 
consuming and not effective to enhance PA or clinical 
outcomes. Individualized pulmonary rehabilitation in the 












































period after an exacerbation of COPD might be a better 
approach. 
Future plans 
By executing this study, we experienced that including 
patients after an exacerbation of COPD is very difficult. 
After 1 year, only 30 patients agreed to participate in the 
study. Intermediate analyses did not reveal better im- 
provements in physical activity in the group that re- 
ceived maximal counseling and real-time feedback 
compared to usual care. Based on these conclusions and 
the fact that the study was very time consuming for the 
researcher, we decided not to continue with the study. 
Conclusion 
We concluded that physical activity levels, functional ex- 
ercise capacity and COPD-related health status recover 
1 month after an exacerbation, but that recovery is lim- 
ited. Real-time feedback and physical activity counseling 
is timing consuming and did not result in better im- 
provements in comparison to usual care.
