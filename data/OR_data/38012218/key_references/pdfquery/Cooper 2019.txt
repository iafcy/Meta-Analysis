Background: Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occur with 
increasing frequency as the disease progresses and account for poor health status, worse 
prognosis, and higher healthcare expenditure. 
Methods: We developed a networked system for remote physiological monitoring (RPM) at 
home and optimized it with statistical process control (SPC) with the goal of earlier detection 
of COPD exacerbations. We enrolled 17 patients with moderate to severe COPD with a mean 
(SD) age of 71.1 (7.2) years. We obtained daily symptom scores, treatment adherence and 
activity levels using a programmable device, and measured daily slow and forced spirometry 
(FEV1, FVC, PEF), inspiratory capacity (IC) and oxygenation (SpO2). To identify exacer- 
bations, we developed rolling prediction intervals for FVC, FEV1, IC and SpO2 using SPC. 
Results: The time taken to perform daily monitoring was reduced from 12.7 (5.4) minutes to 
6.5 (2.6) minutes through software reﬁnements during the study. Adherence to forced and 
slow spirometry was 62.6% and 62.4%, respectively. The within-subject coefﬁcients of 
variation for FEV1, PEF and IC were 12.2%, 16.2%, and 13.1%, respectively. Event rates 
per patient-year for exacerbations were: self-reported 0.42, 2/3 Anthonisen Criteria (AC) 
0.42, modiﬁed AC 2.23, systemic corticosteroid use 0.56, and antibiotic use 0.56. 
Conclusion: We successfully implemented a networked system for RPM of symptoms, 
treatment adherence, and physiology at home in patients with COPD. We demonstrated that 
SPC improves the feasibility of RPM in COPD patients which may increase the likelihood of 
detecting COPD exacerbations.

Introduction 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major health problem and a 
leading cause of disability and mortality throughout the world.1–3 The disease is 
characterized by chronic airway inﬂammation and airﬂow obstruction that is par- 
tially reversible on administration of inhaled bronchodilator therapy. Disease pro- 
gression is usually deﬁned by progressive worsening of airﬂow obstruction or the 
rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). However, it is well 
recognized that FEV1 alone does not fully characterize the disease and that there are 
many phenotypes and extra-pulmonary comorbidities. Disease progression is also 
characterized by an increasing frequency of exacerbations and these exacerbations 
are associated with signiﬁcant morbidity, mortality and increased healthcare

utilization. There is also some evidence to suggest that 
those patients with more frequent exacerbations tend to 
have a more rapid decline in lung function and clear 
evidence that patients with lower FEV1 tend to have 
more exacerbations.4,5 Exacerbations are also associated 
with poor quality of life6 and earlier recognition and 
intervention in exacerbations could improve outcomes 
and result in a better quality of life.7 Appropriate exacer- 
bation management, prevention and early intervention are 
the goals for COPD treatment. There are many interven- 
tions that aim to reduce exacerbation frequency in COPD, 
for example, vaccinations and maintenance therapy with 
inhaled medications. A proactive management strategy 
that focusses on early detection of exacerbations could 
lead to earlier treatment which could, in turn, lessen the 
severity and consequences of the exacerbation. 
Information technology offers interesting possibilities in 
terms of telemedicine or remote patient monitoring at home. 
Remote monitoring has been deployed in patients with chronic 
heart failure aiming to reduce healthcare utilization and 
improve quality of life.8,9 Since COPD is complex disease 
with multiple physiological changes during an exacerbation, 
remote patient monitoring should include both symptoms and 
physiological measurements. Daily spirometry has been per- 
formed at home in several studies.10,11 FEV1, forced vital 
capacity (FVC) and peak expiratory ﬂow (PEF) have been 
shown to be decreased during periods of exacerbations.12,13 
However, inspiratory capacity (IC) was not routinely used for 
daily monitoring due to inadequate data on reliability and 
reproducibility. Thus, remote patient monitoring remains a 
challenge in COPD with a need to develop network manage- 
ment and to evaluate feasibility and adherence to monitoring. 
The questions that need to be answered are: how often should 
patients be monitored to detect symptoms of clinical deteriora- 
tion and which parameter(s) should be included in remote 
patient monitoring? Ultimately, one would hope that remote 
patient monitoring could be used to investigate interventions 
that could be deployed to minimize exacerbation severity and 
perhaps decrease hospitalization and other aspects of health- 
care utilization. 
Our aim was to study the feasibility of remote physio- 
logical monitoring (RPM) in COPD in terms of data cap- 
ture and data reliability. In the course of the study, we 
introduced statistical process control (SPC), an approach 
used in engineering for quality assurance, to help identify 
signiﬁcant signals or predictors. We have demonstrated 
that statistical process control (SPC) can improve its effec- 
tiveness in monitoring COPD patients. 
Materials And Methods 
Study Design 
This was a prospective study to develop and evaluate a 
system for daily remote monitoring of COPD patients 
including physiological measurements and questionnaires. 
Study Population, Inclusion And Exclusion 
Criteria 
We enrolled 17 subjects who lived within a reasonable 
traveling distance to University of California, Los Angeles 
(UCLA). The enrollment criteria were as follows: age >40 
years and a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD 
in accordance with the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 
deﬁnition,14 a smoking history >10 pack-years, post- 
bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <70% and FEV1 <70% based 
on NHANES III reference values.15 Subjects were expected 
to be taking inhaled maintenance therapy for COPD and 
their domestic situation had to be considered conducive to 
remote patient monitoring. Subjects were excluded if they 
had concurrent pulmonary disease other than COPD, e.g., 
lung cancer, active tuberculosis, bronchiectasis unrelated to 
COPD, pulmonary ﬁbrosis, or cystic ﬁbrosis. We excluded 
those with any other disease that carried a prognosis less 
than 2 years, those with a recent history of myocardial 
infarction (within 6 weeks of enrollment), a COPD exacer- 
bation within 6 weeks of enrollment or had a known or 
suspected history of drug or alcohol abuse within 2 years 
prior to the initial visit. This investigation was approved by 
the UCLA Institutional Review Board and all participants 
provided written informed consent. The study was con- 
ducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Baseline Assessment 
All subjects performed baseline assessments at the UCLA 
Exercise Physiology Research Laboratory which included: 
(i) Medical history and physical examination, (ii) docu- 
mentation of COPD medications, and (iii) 12-lead supine 
electrocardiogram. 
Spirometry was performed in accordance with new 
ATS/ERS standards16,17 in the seated position with nose 
clip applied after the subject had rested for at least 10 min. 
Forced and slow spirometry maneuvers were performed 
under the supervision of certiﬁed pulmonary function tech- 
nologist using a portable electronic spirometer (SpiroPro®. 
ERT, Inc. Philadelphia, PA). During the baseline visit, sub- 
jects were trained to use the spirometer themselves and also 
learned how to transfer data via modem.

1–3 days through a secure UCLA network system to the 
UCLA Exercise Physiology Research Laboratory. 
After about 6 months of experience with the study 
procedures, we were able to analyze feedback from our 
subjects on the ease of performing the stipulated maneu- 
vers. It was evident that the standard requirement of per- 
forming at least three acceptable tests according to the 
ATS/ERS standard17 was too arduous on a daily basis 
and was compromising patient adherence to the protocol. 
At this stage, we modiﬁed the analytical software using 
and introduced statistical process control (SPC). This 
change allowed subjects to perform only one or two forced 
maneuvers each day of monitoring provided that one of 
the maneuvers was technically acceptable and could be 
evaluated along with sequential maneuvers performed on 
preceding days (Figure 2). Details of the SPC deployed are 
shown in Appendix A. The reﬁned analytical software was 
available 10 months after the start of the study for all 
subjects undergoing remote monitoring. There were ﬁve 
subjects that used both the old and new analytical 
software. 
Activity Monitoring 
For each subject assigned to remote monitoring, we 
tracked daily physical activity using a commercially avail- 
able tri-axial accelerometer (GENEActiv®. Kimbolton, 
UK). Data were continuously recorded for 24 hrs, every 
day, at 40 Hz frequency and analyzed in 60-s epochs. The 
sum of vector magnitudes was computed with gravity 
subtracted (SVMgs).

General health-related quality of life was determined at 
baseline and ﬁnal visits using the Medical Outcomes Trust 
Short Form 12 questionnaire (SF-12).18 Disease-speciﬁc 
quality of life (for COPD patients) was determined using 
the COPD Assessment Test (CAT).19 The St. George 
Respiratory Questionnaire was also administered to assess 
the quality of life.20 
Remote Patient Monitoring 
Daily Routine 
Subjects who participated in the study were asked to per- 
form daily monitoring using SpiroPro®. This device is an 
FDA-approved handheld spirometer that was also pro- 
grammed with electronic diaries, questionnaires and the 
capability for recording pulse oximetry. Measured values 
were FEV1, FVC, PEF, IC and pulse oximetry (SpO2). 
Novel questionnaires included questions on daily symp- 
toms such as cough, breathlessness, wheezing, sputum 
volume and purulence (CLEAR-Sx), daily physical activ- 
ities (CLEAR-Ex), and questions on daily medications 
(CLEAR-Rx). Healthcare utilization, in terms of physician 
visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations, 
was also captured electronically during monthly telephone 
follow-up by the study coordinator. The expected monitor- 
ing routine is shown diagrammatically in Figure 1. 
Subjects were required to transfer data via modem every 
The GENEActiv® accelerometers were exchanged every 2 
weeks by mail with pre-addressed and pre-paid envelopes 
and data were extracted with the goal of continuing until 
12 months of data had been accumulated. 
Monthly Telephone Contact 
During the study, a study coordinator from the UCLA 
Exercise Physiology Research Laboratory made a monthly 
phone call 
to each subject. Data obtained from these 
monthly phone calls included the CAT questionnaire, 
changes of medication, and any self-reported exacerbation 
events which had necessitated healthcare utilization. 
Deﬁnition Of Predictors 
Predictors were considered to be signiﬁcant ﬁndings from 
remote monitoring. Since this was primarily a feasibility 
Figure 1 Schema for daily remote patient monitoring. 
Notes: Patients were asked to seat themselves at a table in front of the monitoring 
equipment. They then applied the ﬁnger pulse oximeter. They were then taken through a 
series of screens which presented questions about their symptoms (CLEAR-Sx), treat- 
ment adherence (CLEAR-Rx) and physical activity (CLEAR-Ex). Next, they performed an 
inspiratory capacity maneuver followed by a forced vital capacity maneuver. Finally, they 
removed the pulse oximeter. The target completion time was set at 10 mins.

Notes: The 7-day rolling average for each physiological variable was tracked along with the standard deviation and prediction interval. Whenever a daily recorded value exceeded 
the 2-sided 95% prediction interval, then it was considered technically unacceptable and repeated. The lower of the two values was then captured. Whenever a daily recorded value 
fell below the 1-sided 95% prediction interval, then it was repeated and if still below the 1-sided 95% prediction interval, then it was considered to be a clinical event. 
study, the interpretation of the data remained exploratory. 
We used several thresholds to deﬁne prediction events 
from responses to questionnaires or from physiological 
measures. 
Pulse Oximetry 
A fall in SpO2 below 90% for 2 consecutive days or a fall 
below the 7-day rolling average minus 4% for 2 consecutive 
days. Taking into account the known accuracy of the instru- 
ments, a 4% fall in SpO2 is considered clinically meaningful. 
Spirometry 
A fall in FEV1, FVC, PEF or IC lower than the 7-day 
rolling average minus one SD for two consecutive days or 
lower than the 7-day rolling average minus 1.645 SD for 2 
consecutive days. The latter criterion represents a one- 
sided 95% prediction interval. 
Inactivity 
Self-reported lack of any physical activity for two conse- 
cutive days from responses to the CLEAR-Ex. 
Discontinuation Of Maintenance Therapy 
Self-reported failure to take prescribed long-acting inhaled 
maintenance therapy (LAMA and/or LABA) for two con- 
secutive days by CLEAR-Rx. 
Use Of Short-Acting Inhaled Bronchodilators 
An increase in self-reported use of short-acting inhaled

above the 7-day average for that subject at the time of 
enrolment into the study by CLEAR-Sx (period of clinical 
stability). 
The end of positive predictor signal was identiﬁed if 
the value for each predictor had returned to within the 
prediction interval based on the previous 7-day average, 
for 2 consecutive days. 
Deﬁnition Of Outcomes 
The outcome of interest which we wished to detect by 
remote monitoring was exacerbations. However, 
these 
could be deﬁned in several different ways. 
Self-Reported Exacerbation 
A reported exacerbation was an event reported by the 
subject during monthly telephone calls with the study 
coordinator. Typically, 
these events were associated 
with reported changes in medications such as inhaled 
bronchodilators, antibiotics or systemic corticosteroids. 
Ofﬁce visits, emergency department visits and hospita- 
lization were also included in this category of out- 
comes. However, only one enrolled subject-reported 
hospitalizations (three times) but this subject did not 
receive RPM. 
Anthonisen Criteria 
An increase over two consecutive days in three out of three 
symptoms (breathlessness, sputum volume and sputum puru- 
lence) as captured by CLEAR-Sx using the 7-day rolling 
average plus 1.645 SD as the threshold (Anthonisen 
Class 1).21 An increase over two consecutive days in at least 
two out of three symptoms (breathlessness, sputum volume 
and sputum purulence) as captured by CLEAR-Sx using the 7- 
day rolling average plus 1.645 SD as the threshold 
(Anthonisen Class 2). 
Modiﬁed Anthonisen Criteria 
An increased over two consecutive days of two major 
symptoms (breathlessness, sputum volume and sputum 
purulence) or increased one major symptom plus one 
minor symptom (cough or wheezing) as captured by 
CLEAR-Sx using the 7-day rolling average plus 1.645 
SD as the threshold (Modiﬁed Anthonisen Criteria). 
Use Of Antibiotic 
Self-reported use of any antibiotic for worsening respira- 
tory symptoms from responses to the CLEAR-Sx. 
Use Of Systemic Corticosteroid 
Self-reported use of systemic corticosteroids such as predni- 
sone for worsening respiratory symptoms from responses to 
the CLEAR-Sx. 
Data Analysis 
Descriptive Statistics 
Mean and standard deviation was used to describe baseline 
demographic and clinical characteristics. 
Feasibility 
The operational feasibility of remote monitoring system was 
analyzed by compliance rate (number of days with success- 
fully transferred data divided by the total number of days of 
remote patient monitoring). In addition, time spent perform- 
ing daily maneuvers was captured. 
Adherence 
A daily adherence score was calculated by summation of 
successfully transferred values for each monitoring man- 
euver (SpO2, slow vital capacity, forced vital capacity, 
CLEAR-Sx, CLEAR-Ex, CLEAR-Rx). One point was 
allocated for each successfully transferred data element 
giving a maximum possible score of 6 for each day of 
monitoring. The maneuvers included in the analysis are: 














Comparison Of Analytical Software Versions 
For each maneuver and adherence score, a two-way fre- 
quency table was generated according to whether data 
were recorded or not and whether the analytical software 
was old or new (reﬁned). Counts and percentages were 
reported. A Chi-squared test was performed to test if the 
different versions of the software were associated with 
different compliances. 
A subset analysis was performed on ﬁve subjects in our 
study who used both versions of the software. A paired 






t-test was used to compare the percentages of recorded 
maneuvers or averaged adherence scores between the new 
and the old software. The paired subset analysis allowed 
us to further assess any difference in study compliance 
between the old and new versions of software by eliminat- 
ing possible individual differences that occur between 
subjects. 
Results 
Study Population 
We enrolled 17 subjects for remote patient monitoring 
(RPM). Six subjects did not provide any data and three 
discontinued monitoring partway through the 12-month 
target monitoring period. These subjects collectively pro- 
vided 2618 days of data home monitoring or 7.17 patient- 
years. Interestingly, 12 of the 17 subjects were women 
which might suggest that men are less likely to agree to 
home monitoring. After 10 months of monitoring, we 
began using a reﬁned version of the analytical software. 
The reason for this change was based on challenges with 
patient adherence to the stringent criteria which had been 
applied for the performance of spirometry (described 
below).17 Following the change, four enrolled subjects 
were monitored using only the new software. The total 
monitoring time was 1398 patient-days with the old soft- 
ware and 1220 patient-days with the new software. Nine 
subjects withdrew from the study; ﬁve withdrew their 
consent before starting remote monitoring and one was 
lost to follow up. There were three subjects who began 
RPM but dropped out during the study. We included their 
incomplete monitoring data in our analysis. 
Baseline Characteristics 
The baseline characteristics for the subjects are shown in 
Table 1. Their mean (SD) age was 71.1 (7.2) years and ﬁve 
(29.4%) were men. Baseline FEV1 was 1.54 (0.73) L or 
56.8 (15.9) % predicted. FVC was 3.04 (1.09) L or 86.8 
(14.1) % predicted. FEV1/FVC was 50.7%. In other words, 
on average, the subjects had moderate COPD by GOLD 
spirometric classiﬁcation. The median (range) score for the 
COPD Assessment Test (CAT) was 13 (range 5–25) posi- 
tioning most of the subjects as highly symptomatic accord- 
ing to the latest GOLD grading.14 Health status scores 
were 36.4 (4.7) by the Short Form-12 and 28.0 (13.9) by 
the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). These 
ﬁndings categorize the subjects as having mildly to mod- 
erately compromised health status.

Daily physical activity (ΣA) was quantitated as the sum 
of vector magnitude units with gravity subtracted (SVMgs) 
from the tri-axial accelerometers (GENEActiv, Kimbolton, 
UK). The mean (SD) ΣA was 114.2 (18.7) g·min. The mean 
(SD) activity time per day (non-sedentary) was 162.8 (57.7) 
minutes and 99% of this time was classiﬁed as light intensity 
(1.5–2.9 METs). There was no correlation between ΣA and 
CAT (r=0.042, P = 0.800) or between ΣA and baseline FEV1 
(r = 0.148, P = 0.363). Unfortunately, we could not identify 
activity patterns immediately before or after an exacerbation 
event since there was poor subject adherence with wearing 
the accelerometer in relation to any of these events. 
Adherence To Daily Monitoring 
During the initial 10-month phase of this study, we found 
adherence to the remote monitoring routine to be less than 
satisfactory. Allocating one point for complete data trans- 
fer for each of oxygen saturation, forced spirometry, slow 
spirometry, CLEAR-Sx, CLEAR-Rx and CLEAR-Ex, we 
observed an average score of only 3.3 points (out of a 
possible total score of 6) over 1,398 days of monitoring 
(Table 2). At this point, we reﬁned the software used for 
collation and analysis of the data based on principles of 
SPC (Appendix A). With these reﬁnements, the adherence 
score increased to 4.3 points (Table 2) and the proportion 
of monitoring days with higher adherence scores increased 
substantially (Appendix B). For example, the proportion of 
monitored days with an adherence score of 6 increased 
from 50.1% to 69.4%. Completion of each component of 
monitoring before and after the introduction of the reﬁned

Notes: A subset analysis was performed using data from ﬁve participants who used 
both versions of the software. A paired t-test was used to compare if the percen- 
tage of recorded maneuvers or averaged adherence score was different between 
the new and the old software. These participants had a mean (SD) adherence score 
of 5.19 (0.57) for the new software versus 2.97 (0.82) for the old software (P=0.01).

reporting by CLEAR-Ex increased from 49.7 (14.3) % to 
87.0 (9.8) % (P=0.012, Table 5). Subset adherence to slow 
spirometry increased from 49.0 (13.7) % to 87.0 (9.8) % 
(P=0.010, Table 5). Subset adherence to forced spirometry 
increased from 49.7 (12.4) % to 86.9 (9.9) % (P=0.006, 
Table 5). In addition to improved adherence, time spent to 
complete the daily monitoring routine was decreased from 
12.7 ± 5.4 (4.0–38.0) minutes to 6.5 ± 6.2 (3.0–12.0) 
minutes (P<0.001).

The CLEAR study was primarily a feasibility study of 
remote monitoring of COPD patients in their homes, in 
which we evaluated the possibility of capturing daily 
symptoms, 
treatment adherence, self-reported activity, 
spirometry, oxygenation and physical activity by accelero- 
metry. We recruited a total of 17 subjects undergoing 
home monitoring. These subjects collectively provided 
2,618 days of data from home monitoring or 7.17 
patient-years. We monitored some patients for up to 12 
months but for most the burden of daily monitoring did not 
to be accomplished. Therefore, given 
allow this goal 
currently available technologies, remote patient monitor- 
ing might be viewed as a valuable means of short-term 
monitoring in selected patients such as those recently dis- 
charged from hospital after a COPD exacerbation.22 
Our study was successful in several respects. Firstly, 
we were able to reﬁne the software for remote data capture 
which improved overall patient adherence to data record- 
ing from 50.1% to 69.4% and reduced the time spent to 
complete the daily monitoring routine from 12.7 ± 5.4 to 
6.5 ± 6.2 mins (P<0.001). Adherence to pulse oximetry, 
symptom reporting, medication reporting, physical activity 
reporting, slow spirometry and forced spirometry all 
increased signiﬁcantly (P<0.001). Secondly, we discovered 
the value of SPC as a means of identifying criteria for 
prediction events and were able to replace the overly 
the performance of 
burdensome ATS criteria 
spirometry17 with a statistically defensible routine for 
daily monitoring that views all daily measurements as a 
continuous data set. Thirdly, we were able to determine 
event rates (per patient-year) for each of our predictors as 
well as for exacerbations deﬁned by several different cri- 
teria. Fourthly, we were able to associate certain predictors 
derived from remote monitoring with exacerbations. 

Statistical process control involves the use of simple 
statistical tools, such as histograms and ﬂow charts, to 
determine control limits.23 The advantages of this metho- 
dology are that it enables the determination of a stable 
baseline from a longitudinal data set and then sets control 
limits to detect deviations from the baseline.24 Application 
of SPC enabled us to set clinically meaningful thresholds 
around our data and to examine interactions between these 
thresholds. Most importantly, SPC allowed us to interpret 
daily spirometric values as a continuous data set without 
needing to apply the traditional ATS criteria for the per- 
formance of spirometry as might be applicable to a single 
in time.17 This 
set of measurements at a single point 
change was mainly responsible for the reduced daily mon- 
itoring time and the increased patient adherence to captur- 
ing the various data elements. 
Early detection of COPD exacerbations by remote 
patient monitoring was a goal of this research study. To 
date, there have been various attempts to accomplish this 
goal but there is as yet no consensus and to what should be 
measured and what thresholds should be chosen to trigger 
an intervention. One study monitored breathing frequency 
for 3 months in 89 COPD patients.25 The investigators 
identiﬁed Increases in breathing frequency of 4.4/minute

Notes: For each component of remote monitoring, a subset analysis was performed using data from ﬁve participants who used both versions of the software. A paired t-test 
was used to compare if the percentage of recorded maneuvers or averaged adherence score was different between the new and the old software. 
● Oxygen saturation monitoring: mean (SD) adherence score of 84.1 (8.4) % for the new software versus 49.0 (14.2) % for the old software (P=0.006). 
● Daily symptoms reporting: mean (SD) adherence score of 87.0 (9.8) % for the new software versus 50.0 (14.2) % for the old software (P=0.011). 
● Daily treatment reporting: mean (SD) adherence score of 87.0 (9.8) % for the new software versus 50.0 (14.2) % for the old software (P=0.011). 
● Daily activity reporting: mean (SD) adherence score of 87.0 (9.8) % for the new software versus 49.7 (14.3) % for the old software (P=0.012). 
● Slow spirometry monitoring: mean (SD) adherence score of 87.0 (9.8) % for the new software versus 49.0 (13.7) % for the old software (P=0.010). 
● Forced spirometry monitoring: mean (SD) adherence score of 86.9 (9.9) % for the new software versus 49.7 (12.4) % for the old software (P=0.006).

the most frequently occurring of the 
chosen predictors were a fall on SpO2 below 90% and 
increased used of rescue inhaled short-acting bronchodila- 
tor therapy. Interestingly, these predictors were fairly sim- 
ple and raise the question as to what spirometry may add 
in terms of assessing exacerbations. However, all of the 
predictors, including decreases in oxygenation, spirometry 
and physical activity, and increases in inhaled short-acting 
bronchodilator use occurred more often than did exacer- 
bations deﬁned using conventional criteria. The real-world 
experience of the COPD patient is probably more accu- 
rately characterized by this spectrum of daily measures 
than by conventional deﬁnitions of exacerbations. Indeed, 
daily monitoring could provide evidence that links more 
convincingly to longer-term outcomes such as disease 
progression, debility and death. Our study was obviously 
small and only exploratory and much larger-scale investi- 
gations will be needed to establish these connections, if 
they exist. 
Conclusion 
In summary, we successfully implemented remote moni- 
toring for COPD patients in their homes. We have demon- 
strated the feasibility of the approach and improved the 
functionality of the apparatus used for this purpose. We 
have suggested various parameters that could be used to 
monitor COPD patients and suggested methods to deﬁne 
events from these measures. For example, we recommend 
the use of statistical process control to reduce the burden 
of repeated spirometric maneuvers. Due to the relatively

small number of enrolled subjects and even smaller num- 
ber of exacerbations, we were unable to evaluate the 
effects of remote patient monitoring on the cost of health- 
care utilization. Remote monitoring in the home might not 
work for all COPD patients; however, we believe there is 
value in developing these techniques in high-risk patients 
such as those with a history of repeated exacerbations and 
those who have recently been discharged from hospital 
following a COPD exacerbation. A randomized controlled 
trial would be needed to establish that the beneﬁt from this 
kind of monitoring is at least equivalent if not better to 
other home monitoring already being used.
