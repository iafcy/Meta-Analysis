**Objective: To determine the feasibility and efficacy of a six-month, cell phone-based exercise**
persistence intervention for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
following pulmonary rehabilitation.
**Methods: Participants who completed a two-week run-in were randomly assigned to either**
MOBILE-Coached (n = 9) or MOBILE-Self-Monitored (n = 8). All participants met with a nurse
to develop an individualized exercise plan, were issued a pedometer and exercise booklet, and
instructed to continue to log their daily exercise and symptoms. MOBILE-Coached also received
weekly reinforcement text messages on their cell phones; reports of worsening symptoms were
automatically flagged for follow-up. Usability and satisfaction were assessed. Participants completed incremental cycle and six minute walk (6MW) tests, wore an activity monitor for 14 days,
and reported their health-related quality of life (HRQL) at baseline, three, and six months.
**Results: The sample had a mean age of 68 ± 11 and forced expiratory volume in one second**
(FEV1) of 40 ± 18% predicted. Participants reported that logging their exercise and symptoms
was easy and that keeping track of their exercise helped them remain active. There were no
differences between groups over time in maximal workload, 6MW distance, or HRQL (p  0.05);
however, MOBILE-Self-Monitored increased total steps/day whereas MOBILE-Coached logged
fewer steps over six months (p = 0.04).
**Conclusions: We showed that it is feasible to deliver a cell phone-based exercise persistence**
intervention to patients with COPD post-rehabilitation and that the addition of coaching appeared
to be no better than self-monitoring. The latter finding needs to be interpreted with caution since
this was a purely exploratory study.

## Background
Exercise is a well established intervention to improve physical functioning, symptoms,
and quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).[1]
However, patients face multiple barriers to exercise persistence including episodic
exacerbations of their illness, limited ongoing support, and low self-regulatory
capacity.[2–4] Supervised exercise training is a cornerstone of pulmonary rehabilitation
(PR), a recommended multicomponent short-term intervention for patients with moderate
to severe disease.[5] While notable improvements in functional outcomes are associated
with rehabilitation, maintenance of independent exercise in the face of a progressive
illness such as COPD is challenging. Numerous approaches of varying intensity and


-----

duration have been tested to help patients maintain functional
gains achieved with PR including, extending the duration
of rehabilitation,[6] booster rehabilitation,[7] or a combination
of regular telephone follow-up contacts with clinic- or
home-based supervised exercise sessions,[8,9] support groups,[2]
or a pedometer-based home walking program.[10] As a whole,
these resource intensive models have yielded only modest
long term effects compared to usual care. Despite these
negative findings, the epidemiological evidence continues
to argue for further refinement and testing of novel, targeted,
cost-effective interventions to help patients at various stages
of COPD maintain physically active lives.[11]

The pervasive integration of information and
communication technologies in everyday life has ushered
in a new age of anytime–anywhere information access
and exchange. As an example, nearly 90% of the US adult
population used a cell phone for their communication needs
in 2008.[12] Such widespread adoption of a simple innovation
has opened up opportunities to cost-effectively scale up
evidence-based interactive health promotion and disease
management interventions.[13] Cell phones are personal to the
individual; they are always on and always connected thus
enabling new types of health and social interactions otherwise
not previously possible. Several recently published studies showed that cell phones can, in the short term, deliver
effective behavior change interventions in young to middle
age healthy adults[14–17] as well as improve glucose and blood
pressure control in patients with diabetes.[18–20] Two studies,
including our work on use of the Internet and cell phones to
support dyspnea self-management, show that older adults
with COPD are able and willing to use mobile devices for
collaborative monitoring and communication to support
self-care.[21,22] Therefore, the purpose of this exploratory
study was to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a first
generation, cell phone-based exercise persistence intervention
for patients with COPD following completion of PR.

## Methods Study design
We conducted a randomized, repeated measures (0, 3, and
6 months) exploratory study to determine the feasibility
and efficacy of a six-month cell phone-mediated
cognitive-behavioral exercise persistence intervention,
MOBILE (Mobilizing Support for Long-term Exercise), for
patients with COPD. Patient graduates from four PR programs
who successfully completed a two-week run-in period
were randomized to receive either the MOBILE-Coached
(MOBILE-C) or the active control, MOBILE-Self-Monitored


(MOBILE-SM) intervention. Since this was a feasibility
study, we did not conduct an a priori power calculation;[23]
however, we had a target sample of 20 participants based
on a realistic projection of the available PR graduate pool
who would be willing to participate in the study over the
limited recruitment time frame. The study was approved
by the institutional review board at the University of
Washington and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT00373932).

## Recruitment
Due to privacy regulations, participants were initially
approached by PR coordinators for their interest in the
research study. The PR coordinators provided the study with
names and contact information of patients who expressed an
interest in learning more about the study. The study RA either
contacted the prospective participant via phone or arranged to
meet him or her at the PR site to explain the study and obtain
consent. The goal was to approach interested participants
during the final 2–3 weeks of their PR program in order to
allow a two-week run-in period; however, due to scheduling
challenges, some participants did not start their run-in until
they completed PR.

## Sample
Inclusion criteria were: a) stable COPD; b) pulmonary
function results show moderate to severe disease according
to GOLD criteria (forced expiratory volume in one second

[FEV1]/forced vital capacity [FVC] 70% and FEV1
80%); c) no plans to participate in a maintenance program;
d) patients receiving supplemental oxygen were acceptable
if their O2 saturation was maintained at 88% on 6 L/min
of nasal oxygen during the six minute walk (6MW) test;
e) age  40 years; f) ability to speak, read, and write English;
and g) permission from health provider. Exclusion criteria
were: a) active symptomatic illness (eg, cancer, heart failure,
ischemic heart disease, neuromuscular disease, psychiatric
illness); b) unable (eg, severe arthritis) or unwilling to use the
study issued cell phone; and c) reside outside of the wireless
coverage area.

## Study procedures
Participants completed a two-week run-in period in order to
determine their ability to adhere to the exercise and symptom
self-monitoring protocol. They were trained on entering data
via the cell phone (Treo 650 or 700™, Palm Inc., Sunnyvale,
CA, USA), asked to provide a return demonstration, and
were given a step-by-step help booklet with screenshots


-----

of the cell phone displays. The Treo™ model was chosen
because at the time of software development in 2005, it was
the most affordable device with the largest screen size and
touch screen interface, features that patients from another
study felt were important.[22] The study paid for the monthly
data service plan. Participants who submitted at least 80%
of exercise and symptom data during the run-in and chose to
proceed with the study were scheduled for baseline testing
(spirometry, incremental cycle, and 6MW tests, as well as
questionnaires) and randomly allocated to MOBILE-C or
MOBILE-SM. A biostatistician who was not involved in
the day-to-day study operations generated the randomization
sequence and placed the randomization in separate sealed
opaque envelopes. The randomization scheme was stratified
by gender to ensure balanced allocation. The interventionist
was not blind to group assignment; however, the outcome
assessments were performed by a research assistant who was
blinded to this information. All participants met individually
with the study interventionist (HQN) for a 30 to 45-minute
baseline consultation as described below. Participants
returned for testing three and six months later.

## MOBILE interventions
Participants from both treatment groups met with HQN
at baseline to collaboratively design a safe, simple, and
effective independent exercise program that they were
likely to sustain over time. The exercise program was
individualized according to participants’ performance on
the exercise tests, dyspnea at end of exercise, access to
community-based exercise facilities, and preferred exercise
mode. They were encouraged to accumulate up to a total of
150 minutes of moderate-intensity endurance exercise per
week (3–5 sessions per week) per national physical activity
guidelines and to continue with upper and lower body resistance exercises initiated during PR. The nurse also discussed
signs and symptoms participants typically experienced with
the onset of a COPD exacerbation, strategies for self-care,
and how to adjust exercise as needed during these episodes.
Participants were given a copy of a generic exacerbation
action plan with their specific signs and symptoms listed and
were encouraged to discuss and modify the action plan with
their health provider. They were provided a booklet with
exercise tips, local resources, and pictures of stretching and
strengthening exercise as well as an Omron HJ-112 digital
pedometer (Omron Healthcare, Bannockburn, IL, USA);
pedometers are simple self-monitoring tools that provide
immediate and objective feedback and, in turn, may provide
behavioral reinforcement.[24] Both programs were grounded


in behavior change theories and operationalized through the
behavioral components of self-monitoring (MOBILE-SM)
and motivational feedback and assistance with problem
solving to develop self-regulatory capacity for exercise
persistence (MOBILE-C).[25–27]

## MOBILE-Coached (MOBILE-C)
There were two components to MOBILE-C: collaborative
monitoring of symptoms and exercise and ongoing
reinforcement feedback.

#### Collaborative monitoring of symptoms and exercise
Participants submitted daily information about their
symptoms and exercise. An audio alarm was set on the cell
phone calendar tool to remind participants to complete their
entries at a time that was acceptable to them. The data were
transmitted in real-time to a central server and the nurse was
able to review these data for each participant or in aggregate
form.

Participants used Likert scales to rate their overall health
(excellent to poor) and respiratory symptoms (difficulty
breathing [0: none to 4: severe], cough [0: none to 4: almost
constant], and trouble with sputum [0: none to 4: severe]).
Automatic alerts were sent to the nurse’s cell phone if
participants responded having “marked” symptoms for two
consecutive days. The nurse followed up via text messaging
or telephone as necessary. Participants were encouraged
to contact their health provider regarding the increasing
symptoms, to follow their treatment plan, and to continue to
log their data during the exacerbation episode.

Participants entered the following information about their
exercise: mode (walking, biking, other endurance exercises,
and upper and lower body strengthening exercises), duration
(minutes and/or total daily steps), and worst dyspnea during
the endurance exercise using a 0–10 modified Borg scale.
If participants indicated they were not able to exercise, they
were asked to select reasons from a list of common barriers
(COPD flare-up, difficulty breathing, too tired, not motivated,
depressed, too busy, sick, bad weather, bored with exercise,
family responsibilities, on vacation, and pain/discomfort).
Once the data were submitted and sent to the central server,
participants received an instant text feedback summarizing
the exercises they completed for that week.

#### Reinforcement feedback
Ongoing reinforcement feedback was provided via weekly
short text messages to the participant’s cell phone, by the
nurse, based on submitted exercise and symptom information,


-----

eg, “You’ve got it, getting more ‘bang’ for your buck is what
the conditioning is all about. What a great feeling it must be
to know you can do more!”, “I saw that you were quite busy
this week and not able to get much walking as usual. Perhaps
you could do three 10-minute walks until things slow down?”
Participants confirmed receipt of these messages by replying with short text responses or less frequently, with several
follow up text messages. Examples of participant messages
include: “I think I mentioned I do more exercise when nagged
so do nag!!”, “This program helps me a lot. I am able to stay
focused. Again thanks”, and “Thank you for that, atta boy!”

Because of the small QWERTY keyboard and
160 character restriction for each message, participants were
telephoned for situations where more extensive interactions
was appropriate, eg, coaching on problem solving strategies
to overcome reported barriers to exercise, assessing whether
participants were experiencing an exacerbation and encouraging follow up with their health provider, or assistance with
adjustments to exercise goals in response to changes in health
status. Template text messages were also pre-programmed on
the cell phone in an attempt to make it easier for participants
to communicate via text messaging, eg, “I need to talk to you.
Can you call me at home?”, “I think I’m having a COPD
flare-up. I’ve called my doc”, “Will increase the duration of
my walks this week by x”, “Just wanted to let you know I’m
planning to take a vacation from exercise for a week”.

## MOBILE-Self-Monitored (MOBILE-SM)
Participants continued to use the cell phone to enter
information about their symptoms and exercise on a daily
basis and were encouraged to call the research office if they
had questions about their exercise or COPD over the course
of the study. They were informed that self-monitoring helped
others stay committed to their exercise program. A standard
text message was sent to participants each week to thank and
encourage them to continue to submit their data, eg, “Thank
you for your continued efforts with the entries.”, “Thank you
for your regular entries. Your effort is greatly appreciated.”
Aside from the daily automatic calendar reminder to log
their information, MOBILE-SM participants did not receive
any other prompting or personalized feedback; the symptom
alert was also disabled.

#### Measurements
Technical issues and usability
Participants were asked several open-ended questions by
telephone, regarding technical difficulties within the first


week of the run-in period. Technical difficulties such as
missing or compromised data, battery failure, damage,
malfunctioning or lost cell phones were tracked. Usability
and acceptability were assessed at three and six months with
a survey using a Likert type scale and a semi-structured exit
interview at six months.

Beliefs and attitudes towards exercise and self-care
At baseline, participants completed one-item questions
assessing their: 1) satisfaction with rehabilitation’s effects
on their overall health, “Given the effort you’ve put into
your pulmonary rehabilitation program, how satisfied are
you with your overall health?” (0: not at all satisfied to
5: very satisfied); 2) expectations that persisting with exercise
would help maintain their health, “If you were to continue
to exercise on your own after the rehab program, how much
do you expect that the exercise will help with your overall
health?” (0: not at helpful to 5: very helpful); and 3) perceived
importance, motivation, and confidence to continue their
exercise, “How [important is it to you-, motivated are
you-, confident are you-] to continue to exercise on your
own as a way to manage your breathing?” (0: not at all to
10: totally). They also completed two validated questionnaires
that measured the degree of autonomous self-regulation for
exercise (15-items, Self-Regulatory Questionnaire-Exercise

[SRQ-E])[28,29] and activation for self-care (13-items, Patient
Activation Measure [PAM]).[30,31] Self-efficacy for overcoming
barriers to exercise was measured using a 15-item Exercise
Barriers Efficacy Scale;[32,33] this scale was re-administered at
three and six months.

Support for exercise
Support for exercise was measured with a 13-item
Social Support and Exercise Survey.[34] This instrument has
been used extensively in both healthy and clinical populations
to assess enacted support from family and friends specific to
exercise (eg, exercised with me, encouraged me to exercise).[35]
Participants were also asked to rate their overall perceived
support for exercise from people closest to them using a
1 to 5 point Likert scale.

Exercise performance
Exercise performance was assessed using the six-minute walk
(6MW) and incremental cycle ergometer tests. Participants
performed two 6MW tests according to ATS guidelines
and the longer of the two tests was used for analysis.[36]
The incremental cycle ergometer test protocol was similar
to that used in the National Emphysema Treatment Trial.[37]
Duration and peak workload measured in watts was recorded.


-----

Cardiorespiratory status was not measured since previous
studies showed minimal to no changes in physiological
parameters with moderate-intensity, independent exercise
programs.[38,39]

Free-Living Ambulatory Physical Activity
Free-living ambulatory physical activity was measured
using a pager-sized, lightweight, Stepwatch[®] 3 Activity Monitor (SAM; OrthoCare Innovations, Washington
DC, USA) fastened above the right ankle. The SAM is a
dual-axis accelerometer linked to a microprocessor sensor
that directly and continuously records gait cycles (strides)
based on acceleration, position, and timing information.
Stride counts are doubled to represent steps. The SAM
has been validated for use in healthy and chronically ill
older adults in laboratory and community settings and has
an accuracy of 98%–99%.[40,41] Participants wore the SAM
during waking hours for 14 days at baseline, three, and six
months. The SAM was programmed to record in one-minute
epochs; a valid day was defined as having 10 or more hours
(600 min) of monitor wear. The device software was used
to calculate total step counts, percent of time during waking
hours without any steps (inactive), percent active time at
moderate (31–80 steps/min) and high intensity activity
(80 steps/min), and peak performance (average steps/min
of the best 30 minutes of the day).

Health related quality of life (HRQL)
Health-related quality of life (HRQL) was measured with
two validated generic and disease-specific instruments, the
Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (MOS-SF36)[42] and
St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).[43,44] The
SF-36 produces two composite scales of physical and mental
functioning with higher scores indicating better HRQL. The
76-item SGRQ measured the three domains of respiratory
symptoms, activities, and impact, providing a total SGRQ
score. Lower scores indicate better HRQL.

## Statistical analysis
Independent Student’s _t-tests or chi-squared tests were_
used to compare baseline characteristics between groups.
General linear mixed models, a well-established class of
linear models particularly suited for longitudinal repeated
measures data that does not exclude individuals with
missing data, were used to estimate the effect of treatment,
adjusting for individual variation in the outcomes of exercise
performance, physical activity, and HRQL. Significance was
determined using Wald tests (p  0.05). Since this was an


exploratory study and not designed to be adequately powered
for detecting differences between groups, we did not adjust
the alpha levels for testing multiple outcome variables.

## Results Sample flow and baseline characteristics
A total of 43 patients with COPD were referred to
the research study from October 2006 to April 2008.
Nine patients were deemed ineligible for the following
reasons: not completing PR due to death or other reasons,
other pulmonary diagnoses, non-English speaking, major
surgery, medical complications immediately post-PR,
or severe hearing impairment. Other patients expressed
no interest in the study (n = 8), were too busy (n = 2), not
reachable (n = 6), or withdrew after the first run-in week
(n = 1), leaving a total of 17 participants who completed
the two-week run-in for randomization to MOBILE-SM
(n = 9) or MOBILE-C (n = 8) (Figure 1).

The sample characteristics are described in Table 1.
Age and disease severity were not comparable between
the two groups, suggesting that randomization in this small
sample was only marginally successful. Both groups were
similarly satisfied with the positive effects of PR on their
overall health and had high expectations that continued
participation in exercise would maintain their health.
Motivation and confidence to persist with exercise tended
to be lower in MOBILE-SM. Overall activation for self-care
and self-regulation for exercise were relatively high for both
groups. While _enacted support for exercise from family_
and friends were similarly low across all participants, the
MOBILE-C group reported slightly higher overall perceived
support for their exercise.

## Process and mediating measures
#### Technical issues and usability
There were three separate instances where the cell phone fell
out of the wireless network and participants were instructed
via telephone to perform either a soft or hard reset with
removal of the batteries without difficulties. Two devices
had to be exchanged due to persistent unreliable connections
to the network. Since 90% of the participants already had
a cell phone for personal use, the study-issued cell phone
was seldom carried by the participant. Forgetting to charge
the device and not getting the audio reminder were primary
reasons participants cited for forgetting to log their daily
information. Participants in both groups found that it was
easy to submit their data and that the time (approximately
1–2 min) to complete the task was acceptable (Table 2).

They agreed that keeping track of their exercise helped
them stay committed. Text messaging was not perceived
favorably by all MOBILE-C participants. Three participants
who found it difficult to navigate to the texting tool and
use the small keyboard expressed a strong preference for
communication via the telephone. One participant who text
messaged the nurse most frequently stated that she developed
her texting skills because she wanted to communicate with
her grandchildren and actually came to appreciate this form
of communication.


their exercise and symptom data compared to MOBILE-SM,
87% vs 66% over six months.

#### Validation of self-reported exercise
Weighted correlation between self-report of exercise
(n = 448 days) and total SAM step counts for the particular
monitored day was modest (r = 0.36, p = 0.15) but trended
in the right direction. The percentage of time engaged in
moderate to high intensity physical activity was greater on
days that participants reported exercising compared to days
when they did not exercise.


#### Exercise and symptom entries
Participants submitted a total of 2338 exercise and
2400 symptom entries (Table 2); there was a wide range
in the number of entries across both groups. Overall,
MOBILE-C participants were more “adherent” in submitting


#### Barriers to exercise and adverse events
Participants in both groups made a total of 811 entries reporting
their barriers to exercise. The most frequent exercise barriers
were being too busy (n = 300) or having family responsibilities

distance; these differences were not statistically significant
(see Table 3; p = 0.29 and 0.12).

Free-living ambulatory physical activity
Trends in the four physical activity parameters (total
steps/day, percentage time being inactive, percentage time
active at moderate or high intensity, and peak performance)
also tracked changes observed in the laboratory exercise
performance tests (Table 3); MOBILE-SM participants
increased their physical activity over six months whereas
MOBILE-C showed a decline. There was a significant
interaction of treatment group and time in three of the four
physical activity outcomes. MOBILE-SM participants
accrued more steps per day (p = 0.04), presumably through
greater participation in moderate to high intensity exercise
(p = 0.003), and had higher peak performance (p = 0.002).
The proportion of waking time that all participants were
inactive did not significantly change over time.

Health-related quality of life (HRQL)
There were no between group differences for the SGRQ total
score (p = 0.15) or the SF-36 physical and mental composite
scales (p = 0.51 and p = 0.38) (Table 4).

#### Qualitative interviews
Irrespective of the treatment groups, two major themes
emerged from the semi-structured exit interviews:
1) Participants’ desire to stay accountable; and 2) Participants’


motivation to establish an independent exercise routine
after PR.

_“I wanted to stay accountable since I knew that if I commit_
_to something, I’d be more likely to do it. The cell phone_
_kept me honest, I knew I had to fess up if I didn’t do my_
_exercises–that kind of motivation really helps. The summary_
_feedback of how much I’ve done for the week also helps me_
_know if I’m slacking off and how much I still need to do.”_
_“The study has made me more motivated than before to keep_
_exercising even though I don’t like it. I know it makes me_
_feel good so I have to keep going. Having to report what_
_I do and getting feedback on how I’m doing makes me pay_
_attention to what I’m doing”_

## Intervention time and costs
All participants had an initial 30–45 minute face-to-face
meeting with a nurse (∼$25, assuming an annual salary of $80K). The nurse spent up to five minutes per
MOBILE-C participant per week reviewing submitted
data and providing text reinforcement (5 mins × 24 weeks;
two hours, ∼$80). Most MOBILE-C participants received
at least one or two 10-minute telephone calls over the
course of six months (∼$15). Approximately 1–2 minutes
were spent on text messages per week to MOBILE-SM

participants (1 min × 24 weeks; ∼$20). We purchased a
total of 10 Treo 650/700™ cell phones at $300/device;
each phone was used by at least two participants; wireless
data and text message service was $35/month per device.
Software development cost was only $3,000 (30% FTE for
an experienced programmer for two months) since we were
able to modify an existing platform. The approximate total
intervention costs were $655 and $580 for a MOBILE-C
and MOBILE-SM participant, respectively. Nearly 90% of
the intervention cost was due to the software, hardware, and
wireless service; however, per person costs are expected
to be far lower in the future since patients are likely to use
their own cell phones, pooled data service negotiations are
now possible with wireless providers, and incremental costs
for additional users will be negligible.

## Discussion
We showed that it is feasible to deliver a cell phone-based
exercise persistence intervention to patients with COPD and


that the addition of coaching by a nurse (MOBILE-C) did not
appear to be better than ongoing self-monitoring (MOBILE-SM)
for maintenance of functional outcomes six-months post-PR.
In fact, MOBILE-SM showed significant improvements
in physical activity over time compared to declines in
MOBILE-C. To our knowledge, this is the first study to test
the use of a first generation, cell phone-based intervention
to encourage exercise persistence for patients with COPD
after PR.

The primary assumption of this study was that exercise
persistence is critical to maintenance of gains in or at least
attenuation of expected decline in physical functioning
for a chronic, progressive illness such as COPD. Shortterm PR remains the recommended standard of care for
patients with moderate to severe COPD. Unfortunately, the
limited nature of PR as currently structured and reimbursed
provides insufficient support for ongoing self-regulatory
demands associated with long-term behavior change and
efforts at developing durable exercise habits. The MOBILE

interventions were designed as two competing models to
extend the effects of PR by using what has now become
a pervasive personal communication tool, the cell phone.
MOBILE-SM was modeled as a low intensity, affordable
active control intervention (individualized exercise plan,
pedometer, and daily self-monitoring of symptoms and
exercise) that could easily be scaled up. MOBILE-C
included the same elements in addition to immediate
feedback of exercise progress and more real-time, ongoing
reinforcement and problem-solving assistance from a nurse,
mirroring the intensity of previous exercise maintenance
approaches.[8,10]

Based on behavior change theory and findings from
previous studies, we hypothesized that MOBILE-C
participants who received more intensive follow up and
support would show a trend in better maintenance of
functional outcomes; however, this was not the case. The
statistically significant differences between groups in
physical activity may have been spurious since this study
was not sufficiently powered to detect group differences.
Nonetheless, the consistent trend in the activity data suggests
two possible explanations for the unexpected finding that
MOBILE-SM was more effective compared to MOBILE-C.
The differences in baseline characteristics, greater number
of adverse events in MOBILE-C (two falls and three COPD
exacerbations), and relatively small sample size may have
created a situation where outliers adversely influenced the
mean estimates. Also, MOBILE-C participants scored higher


on all measured outcomes at baseline, thus regression to the
mean offers another possible explanation.

Alternatively, the MOBILE-SM active control
intervention was rather robust. Use of pedometers alone has
been shown to increase total step counts on non-PR days for
patients participating in PR.[45] Moreover, the act of recording
pedometer steps which presumably increases the relevance
and processing of this information resulted in higher step
counts than if participants wore the pedometers without
recording their steps as found in a recent study.[46] Since we
did not measure ambulatory physical activity pre-PR, we
could not determine if levels at six months for both groups
were still above baseline.

Step counts vary substantially depending on disease severity. A recent cross-sectional study showed
that patients with GOLD Stage IV disease accrued on
average 3,000 steps/day compared to ∼8,000 steps/day
for GOLD I–II patients.[47,48] deBlock and colleagues[45]
reported that patients with moderate to very severe COPD
averaged 2,200 steps/day pre-PR and increased their step
counts by +1,200 steps/day post-PR. In another study of
a 12-week pedometer-based cognitive behavioral intervention in GOLD Stage I–III COPD patients, Hospes
and colleagues[49] found a difference of 2,152 steps/day
between intervention (+785 steps/day) and control patients
(-1,367 steps/day). Participants in this study registered on
average 5,700 steps/day six months after PR which translates
to approximately 2.5 miles of ambulatory activity per day.


-----

While lower than what is typically recommended for healthy
adults (10,000 steps/day), this level of activity is likely well
above pre-PR activity levels though this will need to be measured in future studies. A recent study of a six-month PR program found that significant increases in walking time above
baseline (10 min/day; +20%) was observed only after six
months of training, not earlier at three months. This increase
was actually not due to the exchange of shorter periods of
walking for longer periods; 83% of patients substituted lying
time for more short bursts of walking time.[50] Additional work
will need to examine whether extended supervised training
or a program like MOBILE or a combination thereof is more
cost-effective in helping patients with COPD sustain a physically active lifestyle.

The automated audio reminders, originally intended to
prompt participants to submit information about their daily
symptoms and exercise actually served as a potent prompt for
exercise as evidenced by the qualitative findings. Participants
in both groups often alluded to the sense of accountability as
a key factor that sustained their commitment to persist with
exercise, a common observation of other studies as well.[51]
Similarly, the act of reporting their barriers to exercise in
real-time may have activated certain internal cognitive or
motivational processes and should be explored further as
a possibly effective strategy to motivate certain subgroups
of patients. In contrast to a previous study that identified
chest infections (COPD exacerbations) as the most common
barrier to exercise based on retrospective self report,[2] our
study found that being “too busy” was the number one
reason participants cited for not exercising. This difference
in findings may be due to disease severity and seasonality;
however, the stark differences between retrospective recall
and real-time reporting merits additional study to truly
understand the barriers to exercise in this population. Finally,
the usability data and qualitative feedback suggested that
text messaging had only modest utility for one third of the
MOBILE-C participants; thus, the relative advantage of
instant personalized communication with the nurse was not
fully realized.

The small sample size and self-selected nature of the
sample represent important limitations of this exploratory
study. Participants who are referred by PR coordinators,
are able to complete PR, and are able to complete the
run-in period are already a highly selected, motivated group;
it was however encouraging that we excluded prospective
participants for reasons other than successful completion
of the run-in. Recruitment of participants from four PR
programs could have introduced heterogeneity in baseline


characteristics; however, there is also within-center variability
in response to PR. The quality of life instruments used in this
study may not been responsive to measuring change. We were
not able to maximize the full potential of the cell phone as
an always on, connected device for real-time support since
most participants did not carry the device on them due to the
bulky form factor but also, because 90% of the participants
already had their own cell phone. An important technical
consideration for future studies of cell phone-based health
interventions is the need to develop platform-independent
applications that can easily load on devices that patients
own. Aside from the costs of purchasing devices that quickly
become obsolete, patients are far more likely to use health
applications that reside on their own personal device. Finally,
the most optimal model of integrated care combined with
active elements of PR remains unclear and continues to be
an ongoing area of research; thus the approach we took of
“back loading” a technology mediated intervention post-PR is
only one of many possibilities for integrating communication
tools to support patients.

## Conclusions
We found that patients with COPD were willing and able
participate in a first generation cell phone-based exercise
persistence intervention despite several technological
challenges. To our surprise, the self-monitored group
showed greater improvements in free-living physical activity
compared to the coached group that received personalized
reinforcement and support over six months but this finding
should be interpreted with caution. Additional research is
warranted on the use of mobile devices and other interactive
communication technologies to support patients with
COPD in their self-management efforts across the illness
trajectory, not just in relation to maintaining functional gains
immediately post-PR. Cell phones will only continue to
evolve and are expected to be robust ubiquitous computing
devices in the future. Second generation devices already
integrate motion and physiological sensors, location-based
tracking, persuasive audiovisual media, and applications
that support the formation of organic social networks; these
tools will no doubt transform and perhaps, enhance the
construction of more effective and personalized behavioral
interventions for health promotion and disease management
in the near future. However, the primary methodological
challenge for future research on any technology-mediated
clinical or behavioral intervention is the rapid changes in
the technologies themselves which could undermine both
internal and external study validity.
