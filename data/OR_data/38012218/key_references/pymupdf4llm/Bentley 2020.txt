### Abstract

**Background:** Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly prevalent and significantly affects the daily functioning
of patients. Self-management strategies, including increasing physical activity, can help people with COPD have better health
and a better quality of life. Digital mobile health (mHealth) techniques have the potential to aid the delivery of self-management
interventions for COPD. We developed an mHealth intervention (Self-Management supported by Assistive, Rehabilitative, and
Telehealth technologies-COPD [SMART-COPD]), delivered via a smartphone app and an activity tracker, to help people with
COPD maintain (or increase) physical activity after undertaking pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).
**Objective:** This study aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of using the SMART-COPD intervention for the
self-management of physical activity and to explore the feasibility of conducting a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) to
investigate its effectiveness.
**Methods:** We conducted a randomized feasibility study. A total of 30 participants with COPD were randomly allocated to
receive the SMART-COPD intervention (n=19) or control (n=11). Participants used SMART-COPD throughout PR and for 8
weeks afterward (ie, maintenance) to set physical activity goals and monitor their progress. Questionnaire-based and physical
activity–based outcome measures were taken at baseline, the end of PR, and the end of maintenance. Participants, and health care
professionals involved in PR delivery, were interviewed about their experiences with the technology.
**Results:** Overall, 47% (14/30) of participants withdrew from the study. Difficulty in using the technology was a common reason
for withdrawal. Participants who completed the study had better baseline health and more prior experience with digital technology,
compared with participants who withdrew. Participants who completed the study were generally positive about the technology
and found it easy to use. Some participants felt their health had benefitted from using the technology and that it assisted them in
achieving physical activity goals. Activity tracking and self-reporting were both found to be problematic as outcome measures
of physical activity for this study. There was dissatisfaction among some control group members regarding their allocation.

**Conclusions:** mHealth shows promise in helping people with COPD self-manage their physical activity levels. mHealth
interventions for COPD self-management may be more acceptable to people with prior experience of using digital technology
and may be more beneficial if used at an earlier stage of COPD. Simplicity and usability were more important for engagement
with the SMART-COPD intervention than personalization; therefore, the intervention should be simplified for future use. Future
evaluation will require consideration of individual factors and their effect on mHealth efficacy and use; within-subject comparison
of step count values; and an opportunity for control group participants to use the intervention if an RCT were to be carried out.
Sample size calculations for a future evaluation would need to consider the high dropout rates.

### Introduction

##### Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the
most prevalent chronic conditions (CCs), and one of the leading
causes of death and disability, in the United Kingdom [1] and
worldwide [2]. COPD is characterized by progressive and
nonreversible narrowing or inflammation of the airways or
alveoli in the lungs [3,4]. People with COPD experience
symptoms such as breathlessness, frequent chest infections,
reduced ability to exercise, and impaired day-to-day functioning

[5-7]. COPD and its treatment cost the UK’s National Health
Service (NHS) approximately 800 million pounds annually

[3,5].

##### Self-Management

Even with appropriate medical care, people with COPD
experience symptoms and functional challenges on a daily basis,
and therefore, they must engage in long-term self-management
to maintain their physical, social, and psychological health [8,9].
Teaching people with CCs to self-manage their health has
become an important strategy for alleviating symptom burden
and improving quality of life and is advocated within the NHS
as a method of empowering people to take control of their health

[10]. Participation in self-management activities requires
changes to personal health behaviors by the individual with
COPD. For example, COPD is associated with low physical
activity levels [11]—higher levels of physical activity in the
management of COPD are associated with a lower risk of
hospital admission, a lower risk of COPD-related and all-cause
mortality, and a higher health-related quality of life compared
with those with lower activity levels [12,13].

##### Pulmonary Rehabilitation

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an intervention that aims to
foster self-management among people with COPD in the United
Kingdom. It is a group-based program that takes place over a
minimum of 6 weeks and aims to teach people with COPD (and
other lung conditions) to self-manage their condition [5,14].
UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2018
guidelines [14] stipulate that the service should be available
nationally for all people with COPD who have recently been
hospitalized with the condition or who are functionally restricted
by the condition. The program includes physical exercise of the
upper and lower extremities, education about different aspects


of the condition and how to manage them (eg, breathlessness),
and strategies for improving daily functioning [4,5,14]. PR has
demonstrated a number of benefits for people with COPD,
including improved exercise capacity, alleviation of symptoms,
reduced number and severity of exacerbations, reduced
depression, and improved quality of life and sense of control

[15]. In addition, PR has been demonstrated as cost-effective
in the UK context [5]. However, long-term maintenance of
increased physical activity and self-management behaviors after
PR completion is a significant challenge [16,17].

##### Health Behavior Change

It is advantageous to design health behavior change interventions
that are underpinned by behavior change theories or models,
eg, the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) [18]. Within the BCW
model, intervention functions and policy categories are arranged
around a central _hub that outlines three different sources for_
health-related behaviors: opportunity, capability, and motivation.
By providing education, training, persuasion, and environmental
restructuring and enablement, PR can increase the social and
physical opportunity for patients with COPD to engage in
self-management, increase the physical and psychological
capability of patients to engage in self-management, and help
patients feel motivated to carry out self-management behaviors.

The potential for digital technology to help people with COPD
to self-manage their condition is increasingly being investigated

[19,20] and advocated in the NHS [10,21]. Bartlett et al [22]
demonstrated that people with COPD find support with a
primary task, and dialog support (eg, through feedback), to be
persuasive technological strategies to help increase their levels
of physical activity. Therefore, a technological intervention for
self-management that incorporates these elements could increase
an individual’s capability, opportunity, and motivation to carry
out that behavior (eg, motivation through encouraging feedback).

##### Mobile Health

Although the exact definition is disputed, mobile health
(mHealth) broadly refers to medical or health care interventions
delivered through mobile technology (eg, smartphones) [23].
Digital technologies such as mHealth offer several advantages
over more traditional forms of care, including low up-front cost

[24]; familiarity and convenience for patients [21]; better access
to information [24]; improved communication between patients
and health care professionals (HCPs) [21,24,25]; provision of
real-time feedback to patients [24]; and allowing patients to


-----

JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Bentley et al


monitor their own data [24,25]—all of which potentially increase
health service efficiency and reduce costs [21,25]. Although
mHealth tools represent a promising means to encourage greater
self-management of COPD, findings from a systematic review
in this field were inconclusive owing to a high risk of bias in
the included studies, thus indicating the need for more research

[19]. Digital health interventions should be evidence based,
person based, and robustly evaluated, with considerations given
to future implementation of the intervention at an early stage
of its development [20].

##### Intervention Development

We developed an mHealth-based self-management intervention
for COPD. According to the Technology Acceptance Model,
the perceived usefulness of a technological intervention directly
affects an individual’s intention to use the technology in question

[26]. Therefore, we carried out a large amount of exploratory
work with the intended users and stakeholders of the technology.
Qualitative semistructured interviews were conducted with
people with COPD (n=15), their family members (n=5), and
HCPs who work in PR services (n=7). During the interviews,
we explored participants’ experiences of COPD
self-management, their priorities for self-management, and their
views on using digital technology to aid self-management. We
also showed participants examples of ways in which digital
technology could enhance capability, opportunity, and
motivation [18] for self-management of COPD, eg, through
goal setting and automatic monitoring of goals, demonstrating
different types of devices and their functions, etc. The purpose
of these interviews was to explore participants’ reactions to the
possibility of using digital technology to help with
self-management of the condition and to feed into the design
of such an intervention.

During these exploratory interviews, both people with COPD
and HCPs identified physical activity as being a high priority
for COPD self-management. Feedback from the interviews
informed the development of a prototype intervention that used
an activity tracker and a smartphone app to help people with
COPD set physical activity goals and monitor their progress.
A total of 5 in-house researchers (unconnected with the project)
and 5 participants with COPD from the exploratory interviews
were later shown the prototype intervention and were asked to
carry out think-aloud tasks using the technology, in accordance
with a user-centered design [27]. The 5 participants with COPD
involved in this stage of usability testing were selected to include
a range of ages, gender, and COPD severities. The usability
testing helped with assessing the intervention’s relevance and
usability, identified problems in its operation, and helped further
refine the intervention. After this stage, 2 people with COPD
used the intervention over a period of many weeks. They relayed
their experiences of using the intervention and offered
suggestions for improvement.

The results of these interviews, of usability testing, and of a
scoping literature review of existing best practice guidelines
informed the development of a Self-Management supported by
Assistive, Rehabilitative, and Telehealth technologies-COPD
(SMART-COPD) app for COPD self-management and informed
strategies for its use. In addition to the emphasis on physical


activity, the importance of HCP support in the path to
self-management was also emphasized. Therefore, the
intervention was incorporated within the PR program, with the
aim of encouraging individuals to maintain increased levels of
physical activity after completing PR. In accordance with the
BCW approach, the app provides motivation to self-manage
physical activity through personalized feedback along with PR
and provides the capability and opportunity to continue
self-managing physical activity after PR. The development of
the mHealth intervention is summarized in a short YouTube
video [28].

##### Feasibility and Acceptability

Feasibility studies are carried out before large-scale studies
(such as randomized controlled trials, RCTs) with the aim of
establishing whether an intervention can be used and, if so, how
it should be used [29]. The feasibility stage includes testing the
intervention for its acceptability, estimating likely recruitment
rates and retention of participants, and testing out design
elements of a larger study [30]. A mixture of quantitative and
qualitative methods is likely needed to establish feasibility [30].

An important element of the feasibility of carrying out a larger
study is the acceptability of the intervention itself. In this study,
we assessed the acceptability of the intervention using a
combination of both qualitative (eg, interview data) and
quantitative (eg, usage data collected by the intervention) data.
Assessment of acceptability included attitude toward the
intervention; burden of the technology; perceived effectiveness
of the intervention; how well the intervention fits with the
participants’ perceived value system; intervention coherence;
and self-efficacy in being able to use the intervention [31].
Although objective data, such as dropout rates, provided a
quantitative indication for ease of use of the intervention, the
research team did not set predetermined thresholds for levels
that would deem the intervention feasible or not feasible. The
study evaluated the feasibility of delivering a complex
intervention in a complex health care setting; therefore,
qualitative interview feedback and reasons for withdrawal were
necessary to understand the nuances behind the intervention’s
feasibility.

##### Research Questions

This paper reports the results of a randomized feasibility study.
The research questions (RQs) were as follows:

- RQ1: Is it feasible and acceptable to use the SMART-COPD
intervention within PR to encourage people with COPD to
maintain (or increase) their physical activity levels after
PR?

- RQ2: Is it feasible to conduct a future large-scale RCT to
investigate the effectiveness of the intervention?

Specifically, the following questions were addressed:

- How do people with COPD and HCPs react to the
technology? What are their views on the technology, and
on whether it is feasible to use the technology for physical
activity in COPD? (related to RQ1)

- Is the technology acceptable to people with COPD and
HCPs? For example, do they use the technology as


-----

JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Bentley et al


intended? Do they find the technology easy to use? Which
parts of the technology do they use? Are there any problems
with the technology? (RQ1)

- What are the recruitment and dropout rates for the study?
What do these patterns tell us about the acceptability of the
technology and the feasibility of conducting a future RCT?
(RQ1 and RQ2)

- Which outcome measures should be used for a larger-scale
evaluation of the technology? (RQ2)

- How do people with COPD react to randomized assignment
and to being in the Control group? (RQ2)

- How should the technology be deployed: both within health
care services and within an RCT? Are any changes needed
to increase the feasibility of using technology in this way?
(RQ1 and RQ2)

The overall aim of the study was to determine the feasibility
and acceptability of both the intervention and the possibility of
carrying out a future RCT.


### Methods

##### The Self-Management Supported by Assistive, Rehabilitative, and Telehealth Technologies-Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Intervention

The SMART-COPD intervention is an Android smartphone
mobile app used in conjunction with a Fitbit wearable activity
tracking device. The app encourages physical activity through
goal setting, self-monitoring, and feedback, based on behavior
change and persuasive technology principles [18,22]. The app
includes three elements of physical activity: general cumulative
activity over each day (ie, step count); a timed daily walk; and
timed daily exercises based on standard PR exercises (eg, leg
lifts). The integrated content of the app is summarized in Table
1.

aIndividualized goals set in partnership with PR staff. Participants self-monitor progress via described outlets.
bCOPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.


Participants decided on a personal starting goal for each of the
three activities based on advice from their PR team and their
own preferences. It was important that participants felt
_ownership of their goals and that both the participant and HCP_
felt they were achievable. The intention was that they should
consistently achieve their activity goals on a daily basis and, if
possible, gradually increase each physical activity goal over
time. The app was used initially in conjunction with the PR
program, with continued use once the PR program had finished.

Study participants were provided a Motorola smartphone with
the SMART-COPD app installed and a Fitbit activity tracker
for the duration of the study. Each smartphone was fitted with
a SIM card to enable remote data transfer. The app could be
used in conjunction with 1 of 3 Fitbit models: Charge HR
(wrist-worn); Charge 2 (wrist-worn); or One (hip-worn). Fitbit
activity trackers use low-energy Bluetooth to automatically
transmit (or sync) data periodically whenever the device is in
the proximity of a smartphone with an appropriately configured
Fitbit app. These data are then transferred to Fitbit’s internet
servers, where they can be accessed in the SMART-COPD app.
The devices have a rechargeable battery with an approximately
5-day battery life. Fitbit One had previously demonstrated high
accuracy compared with other low-cost activity trackers even
for slower walking speeds (a factor highly relevant for COPD)



[32]. The decision to use Fitbit as a step count device was further
supported by in-house comparisons of step count accuracy of
various activity monitoring devices (including Fitbit One and
Charge HR), at different walking speeds, carried out by
researchers and people with COPD.

##### The Setting

In total, PR teams at 3 NHS sites in Northern England, United
Kingdom, participated in the feasibility study. Northern England
has one of the highest rates of lung disease in the United
Kingdom, possibly due to greater socioeconomic deprivation
and higher rates of smoking compared with the south of England

[3,4,33]. Preliminary work was conducted to map current PR
care pathways (eg, workshops with PR staff; observation of PR
sessions, numbers, and demographics of referred patients; etc),
and we worked together with the PR teams to determine how
the intervention might best be used within the PR program.
Each PR service was delivered over a 6- to 7-week timeframe,
with similar exercises and educational content. Therefore, the
same study procedure was used across all sites.

##### Study Design

The study was a randomized feasibility study [34] using both
quantitative and qualitative methods. The Medical Research
Council Framework for the evaluation of complex interventions


-----

JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Bentley et al


emphasizes the feasibility stage as a means of testing procedures
and estimating parameters for a future large-scale evaluation

[30].

##### Participants

The aim was to recruit 30 individuals who were formally
diagnosed with COPD and who were attending PR in 1 of the
3 study sites. This sample size was chosen based on advice from
an in-house statistician and on a study by Julious [35]. Potential
participants met the inclusion criteria if they were attending PR.
There were no exclusion criteria based on age, comorbidities,
or having previously attended PR for managing COPD.
Participants did not need any previous experience of using
digital technology.


##### Procedure

Details of the study procedure are summarized in Figure 1. PR
attendees were assessed for PR eligibility before starting the
program. Participants attended PR twice weekly for 6 to 7
weeks. Each week PR physiotherapists informed the researchers
if there were any new starters with COPD expected at PR
sessions in the coming week. In their second PR session (during
week 1), participants were asked if they would be happy for a
researcher to speak with them about the feasibility study and
what it would involve. Potential participants were given a
participant information sheet and asked to contact the research
team within the next week if they wished to take part.

##### Data Collection and Randomization

If a participant agreed to take part, then a baseline appointment
was organized with one of the research team members for week
2 of PR. At the baseline visit, written informed consent was
obtained and the participant completed a set of questionnaires
(see Quantitative Outcome Measures). The participant was then
randomized to 1 of 2 conditions:

- Group 1 (intervention) used the app and activity tracker to
monitor, maintain, and (if possible) increase their physical
activity during their time in PR (the PR phase) and for a
further 8 weeks afterwards (the maintenance phase).

- Group 2 (control) wore a blinded activity tracker for the
PR phase and maintenance phase. A strong black tape was
used to cover the activity tracker’s screen so the participant
would not be able to see their step count. This group was
also provided with a smartphone so that data from the
activity tracker could automatically be sent to, and stored
on, the phone.

Uneven randomization was used, whereby two-thirds of
participants were assigned to group 1 and one-third to group 2.
This was due to the need to assess the acceptability and usability
of the intervention. A blinded researcher used sealed opaque
envelopes to generate randomization. This method of allocation
was chosen because it mimics the more rigorous
software-generated randomization method used in RCTs, in a
manner that was satisfactory for the purposes of the feasibility
study.

After allocation, the researcher demonstrated the technology to
the participant and set up baseline activity goals within the app.
Participants were provided with an instruction manual and the
research team’s contact details.

Participants then used the app and activity tracker, or wore a
blinded activity tracker, during the PR phase in accordance with
their allocation. An appointment was made for a member of the
research team to visit the participant at the end of PR and take
follow-up 1 (F1) measurements. At this point, the set of
questionnaires applied at baseline was repeated.

Another appointment was made for 8 weeks after finishing PR
(follow-up 2 or F2), ie, the end of maintenance. If possible,
participants were seen at the PR facility so that a final
incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) could be conducted (see
Quantitative Outcome Measures), a final set of questionnaires
could be completed, and a semistructured qualitative interview
could be conducted about their experiences on the study. The
interview explored their experiences of using the technology,


perceived benefits and barriers to using the technology,
acceptability of randomization, perceived impact of the
technology on physical activity, and tolerability of outcome
measures (see Multimedia Appendix 1). During the final ISWT,
participants wore a Fitbit Charge 2 (wrist-worn), a Fitbit One
(hip-worn), and Axivity motion sensors on their hip and wrist
to compare step count accuracy across different devices for
individual participants. The devices were found to be
comparable in accuracy, although detailed results of this
comparison are not reported here. Finally, the research team
retrieved the technology from the participant.

Clinical support (via the relevant PR team during PR sessions)
and technical support (via the research team) was available to
all participants throughout their time in the study. The protocol
and all materials used for the study were reviewed by people
with COPD for relevance and comprehensibility.

##### Health Care Professionals

At the end of the recruitment period, PR team members (eg,
respiratory physiotherapists) were contacted via email with a
participant information sheet attached and were asked to contact
the research team if they wished to take part in a qualitative
semistructured interview or focus group discussion. The purpose
was to explore HCPs’ opinions of using the technology
alongside PR, including perceived benefits and barriers to using
the technology, acceptability of the technology, and perceived
impact on participants’ physical activity (see Multimedia
Appendix 2).

##### Quantitative Outcome Measures

The feasibility of using a number of quantitative outcome
measures (for a future RCT) was assessed during the study, eg,
for relevance and ease of completion. The System Usability
Scale (SUS) [36] was also included as an objective measure of
ease of use of the intervention. The quantitative outcome
measures used are summarized in Table 2.

Exercise capacity was assessed using the ISWT, a well-validated
measure [37] used as part of standard clinical practice by all
three PR sites. Patients completed a baseline ISWT at their
assessment visit and another ISWT in their final week of PR
(ie, at F1) as part of standard practice. The research team
requested these scores for all participants in the study and added
an additional ISWT for participants at the end of the
maintenance phase (F2). This was conducted at the PR facility
by a respiratory physiotherapist. The research team collected
all other outcome measures.

##### Quantitative Analysis

Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic data,
ISWT scores, and questionnaire-based outcome measures in
SPSS. Data collected via the SMART-COPD app on amount
and types of physical activity were summarized and explored
in Microsoft Excel to provide insights into how the intervention
was used.


##### Qualitative Analysis

Qualitative interviews with patients with COPD and HCPs were
transcribed verbatim, and a thematic analysis [45] was used to
identify key themes within the data (using NVivo software).
The first author explored the transcript data, taking notes on
pre-existing and emerging themes. These notes were used to
build a coding framework, which was used to code the transcript
data within NVivo. All data within individual themes were then
explored and summarized (including where there were


-----

JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Bentley et al


differences between participants), to produce summaries of each
theme and also to identify relationships between themes.

##### Ethics

The study received NHS research ethics approval (15-YH-0458),
as well as Health Research Authority and research governance
approval from each NHS site. The feasibility study was
registered on a clinical trials database (NCT02691104).


### Results

##### Recruitment and Dropout Rates

A total of 30 people with COPD participated in the feasibility
study: 19 participants were assigned to the intervention group
and 11 were assigned to the control. 16 participants completed
all three data collection points and 14 participants withdrew
from the study. The groups were well matched on most
demographics. Participants’ demographics are summarized in
Table 3.

##### Study Withdrawal

In the intervention group, 47% (9/19) of participants withdrew,
and in the control group 46% (5/11) of participants withdrew;
thus, attrition rates were similar for both groups. In total, 12
participants withdrew before F1: 3 participants withdrew either
at baseline or within 2 weeks of baseline; and 9 participants
withdrew within 3 to 6 weeks into the study. A further 2
participants withdrew between F1 and F2. More women


withdrew compared with men (9/17, 53% vs 5/13, 38%,
respectively). Withdrawers also had a lower median age
compared with completers (median 65.5, IQR 59.8-70.5 years
vs median 68.0, IQR 61.0-71.3 years, respectively). The most
common (voluntarily given) reasons for withdrawing included
ill health (n=5); withdrew from PR (n=4); burden of research,
of technology, or of completing daily exercises (n=4); technical
issues or frustrations with the technology (n=4); and
disappointment at having been assigned to the control group

(n=3). Some withdrawers cited more than one of these reasons.
Several withdrawers (n=3) still liked the concept of the app,
and 2 participants who had stopped attending PR would have
liked to continue using the app.

Descriptive statistics on baseline outcome measures revealed a
pattern of differences between participants who completed the
study and those who withdrew. Withdrawers showed signs of


having worse baseline disease severity and health compared
with those who completed the study. These comparisons are
summarized in Table 4.

Participants who withdrew had worse baseline scores on exercise
capacity, quality of life, and depression compared with those
who completed. However, sample sizes were small, so this
finding should be interpreted with caution.

##### Use of the Technology

For intervention participants, physical activity and usage data
collected by the SMART-COPD app were transmitted by email
using the smartphone’s mobile data connection. These data


provided indications of how the app was used and how often.
Table 5 summarizes the percentage of days on which each
physical activity component of the app was used by each
participant.

aSteps were recorded by an activity tracker even if the Self-Management supported by Assistive, Rehabilitative, and Telehealth technologies-Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease app itself was not used.
bParticipants who later withdrew from the study.


A total of 3 intervention participants withdrew immediately or
within 1 to 2 weeks of receiving the technology. No app use
data were recorded for these participants. One intervention
participant (17) withdrew 5 weeks into the study but had no app
use data recorded. Technical issues were noted for this
participant (eg, the activity tracker not holding its charge);
however, it is unclear if this was the reason for the lack of data
from this participant.

On average, the SMART-COPD app was used on 73% of days
on which it was deployed to a participant, although individual
participants’usage patterns varied widely. The steps component
of the intervention was the most frequently used physical activity
strategy overall. However, use of the steps component decreased
for some participants when they moved into maintenance.


Participants generally maintained consistent (high or low) usage
levels for daily walks and exercises across the PR and
maintenance phases.

##### Outcome Measure: Step Counts

Participants did not show a consistent pattern overall with
respect to whether their step counts increased, decreased, or
stayed the same over time. Most intervention participants who
completed the study had a near-complete dataset for the full
study timeframe. Only 2 control participants had near-complete
datasets. Some gaps in the data were explained by technical
issues or by participant illness, but many gaps were unexplained.

JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Bentley et al


##### Outcome Measure: Incremental Shuttle Walk Test

The ISWT was found to be relevant and appropriate as an
outcome measure for exercise capacity, as this was routinely
collected in the three PR sites and participants were used to
completing it. However, the logistics of carrying out a third
ISWT at F2 (when participants had already been discharged
from the PR service) at times proved challenging owing to the
need to coordinate availability between participants, the research
team, and the PR team.

##### Outcome Measure: Questionnaires

All participants were generally satisfied with the questionnaires
and length of time needed to complete them. Some participants
requested help from the researcher to complete them, eg, asking
the researcher to read questions aloud and complete answers on
their behalf. Some questions felt repetitive to participants if a
similar question was included on more than one questionnaire.
However, the only questionnaire that caused significant
problems in completion was the Community Healthy Activities
Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) self-reported physical


activity questionnaire. Participants did not identify with the
_Americanized nature of included activities or the wording of_
some of the questions (eg, shooting pool), which were felt to
be less relevant to a British population. Researchers also noted
problems in participants’ understanding of the timeframe to
which the questions applied and confusion over calculating how
often, or for how long, each activity was completed.

##### System Usability Scale

Individual participants’SUS scores at F1 and F2 are summarized
in Table 6 (for intervention participants who completed the
study). Scores are out of 100, with a higher score indicating
greater usability.

SUS scores were generally high compared with the industry
standard average score of 68 [42], indicating the intervention
had a higher than average usability level across technological
systems from multiple industries. Participants’ SUS scores
generally (but not always) increased with time spent using the
technology.

##### Qualitative Results

 People With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Reactions to the Intervention

The interviews captured the views of 16 participants who
completed the study (n=10 intervention group; n=6 control
group). Qualitative data relating to the intervention were
categorized into six main themes: technology; technical issues;
previous experience (with digital technology); integration with
PR; control group issues; and involvement in the project.

##### Technology

The intervention was generally well liked and well accepted
among participants who completed the study. Most of these
participants found the technology easy to use and were able to
incorporate it into their daily routine, eg, putting on the activity
tracker in the morning:

_Yes, absolutely no problem, once I’d got, had a_
_shower and you know put it on and just carried on_


_what I was doing… even forgetting sometimes I’d got_
_it on. [Patient 28]_
Around half of (completed) the participants felt they had
benefitted (physically or psychologically) through enhanced
confidence, monitoring of physical activity, and incentivization
to exercise:

_If I hadn’t found this technology erm I would probably_
_be just sat at home watching TV… it would never_
_occur to me to do exercise at home and to move._

[Patient 3]
Many participants found the technology motivational. Feedback
on activity and goal attainment motivated them to do more:

_You look at it in the day and... see how many steps_
_you’ve done and it encourages you I think. [Patient_
6]
Two participants did not use the intervention in this way—they
were already active and used the intervention to monitor activity
that they were already doing rather than trying to increase it:


-----

JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Bentley et al


_It’s just the way I live. I’ve not done anything different_
_to what I normally do… made me realise how much_
_I was doing, or how little I was doing but I wouldn’t_
_say it increased what I put into it. [Patient 15]_
One participant (21) disliked the smartphone and
SMART-COPD app and found them difficult to use (supported
by her F2 SUS score), although she was happy to continue
wearing the activity tracker:

_Rubbish cause I couldn’t do it, couldn’t do it, no way_
_could I do it… I’ve never been able to use one of them_
_phones for a start. [Patient 21]_
Participants rarely updated goals. Reasons included conforming
to what the _experts_ (physiotherapists or researchers)
recommended (and the physiotherapists did not explicitly tell
them to increase these goals) and keeping the goal achievable:

_I didn’t want to do it too much because I knew I’d be_
_disappointed if I didn’t reach the goal I’d set. [Patient_
3]
Opinions of the daily walk and exercise sections of the app were
mixed. Even where the exercise section was used, the videos
were not well liked—they were viewed as repetitive or
participants were put off by people in the videos they perceived
as less able than themselves:

_I haven’t used the exercise bit because I looked at the_
_exercise thing and it’s all people sat in chairs and_
_looks like they’re all in old people’s homes, I’m a_
_little bit more active than that. [Patient 15]_
Reasons for low use of the daily walk section included difficulty
getting the smartphone to register the walk and not wanting to
walk outside alone:

_I don’t go for daily walks so I thought I’ll give it a_
_try in the house and I had to walk at such a speed [for_
_the walk to register via the accelerometers in the_
_smartphone] I was frightened of banging into doors_
_and all sorts so in the end I decided not to do the daily_
_walks. [Patient 3]_
There were misunderstandings around the daily walk section
of the app, with a few participants referring to the step count
and daily walk sections interchangeably. At least two
participants did not understand that the phone needed to register
continuous movement and hence needed to be placed in the
hand or the pocket to record the duration of the walk:

_I can have walked for twenty minutes at the rehab_
_centre on the err treadmill and it doesn’t show it, it_
_never works… I have on the machine you know I stand_
_it up on the machine. [Patient 6]_
Many participants, from both groups, discovered the Fitbit app
on the smartphone, even though it was not intended that either
group should use it directly. Installation of the app was necessary
for data synchronization but could be discovered by participants
with an experience of, or curiosity about, using smartphones.
Several used this, rather than the SMART-COPD app, to monitor
their step counts. At least two control participants used the Fitbit
app to monitor their steps and increase their activity despite it
being against the planned intervention:


_Just at odd times I did [check steps on Fitbit app],_
_yes, yes just odd times, I didn’t cheat at all. [Patient_
28, control]
Overall, the activity tracker was the most liked component of
the intervention, and a few participants expressed a preference
for using the activity tracker alone and leaving out the
SMART-COPD app:

_With Fitbit bit, chuck phone away and just leave_
_Fitbit. As long as you’ve got the app that you can_
_have on your own phone. [Patient 24]_
Participants who already owned smartphones often expressed
a preference for having the SMART-COPD app installed on
their own phone rather than carrying and charging extra
equipment. In total, 3 participants were conscious of not wanting
to damage or lose the study’s equipment, which would be less
of a worry if they were using their own technology:

_The only thing that did affect me was the fear of losing_
_it all… it’s using somebody else’s equipment and_
_being responsible for it. [Patient 6]_
Most participants did not carry the smartphone with them when
they left the house. Participants were also less likely to use the
technology if they were unwell, busy, or on holiday:

_I just want to get up and go. If I’m taking my dog out_
_for a walk I’ve got enough trouble getting leads,_
_making sure there’s bags on it and harness on dog_
_and treats to make sure they come back without_
_having to take [the phone]. [Patient 24]_

##### Technical Issues

The Fitbit device frequently stopped synchronizing with the
Fitbit app. This happened for at least six participants. These
occurrences were sometimes due to the device not being charged
and, in one case, a participant accidentally deleting the Fitbit
app from the smartphone. However, in most cases, these
communication errors were unexplained:

_They weren’t getting no data through and I said well_
_I don’t know whether Fitbit what’s not charging or_
_phone what’s not charging. [Patient 25]_
There were a number of reports of itchiness, rash, or discomfort
from wearing the activity tracker, particularly in warm weather:

_I bruise very easily, my skin is wafer thin and it was_
_very uncomfortable and it marked both arms so it had_
_to go. [Patient 3]_
A few participants who experienced early problems were offered
the hip-worn Fitbit One as an alternative and seemed to get on
well with this option. A few other participants expressed a
preference for a hip-worn activity tracker at the interview stage,
eg, for discretion.

There were at least three cases of the activity tracker catching
on clothes and falling off:

_I lost it in the churchyard once; luckily it was still_
_there when I went back... it had caught on my sleeve_
_and just pulled off. [Patient 15]_

JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Bentley et al


##### Previous Experience

Many participants had previous experience with using digital
technology, such as smartphones and computers, and a few had
a prior interest in technology:

_[Talking about the game Pokémon Go] So I quite_
_enjoy that and I’ve starting using my eggs as distances_
_on how much I’ve walked. [Patient 24]_
However, some participants had little or no previous experience,
and these participants were more likely to encounter difficulties
with using the intervention:

_I don’t know how they work and I’m not interested to_
_be honest. The learning how to work it, in my opinion_
_I’m at wrong time, wrong side of life now to start_
_worrying about technology. [Patient 25]_
No one had previously used a Fitbit. Some participants knew
about Fitbit devices through advertisements or family members,
but had perceived them as being irrelevant for themselves or as
being only for athletes:

_I wouldn’t have known about that Fitbit cos I weren’t_
_interested in things like that… I never took no notice._
_I always thought people did it when they went in gym,_
_you know like they bought a Fitbit just to cycle and_
_things like that. [Patient 29]_
Some participants felt the intervention was less suited to people
with COPD who were older, less technologically savvy, with
more severe disease, or living alone, despite the app being
perceived as easy to use:

_I could understand how some people that are a bit_
_older than me would struggle with it if they hadn’t_
_got any support in the house. I mean I’ve got a_
_husband and he’s pretty good with technical things_
_but I didn’t have to really ask him, I figured it myself._

[Patient 6]

##### Integration With Pulmonary Rehabilitation

There were few reported issues with the intervention being used
alongside PR, and many participants liked their concurrent use.
Most participants did not speak to the PR team about the
technology. However, where they did speak to physiotherapists,
they often found the HCP did not know much about the
technology or the study (though they still showed an interest
and tried to help with any issues):

_They didn’t know how it worked. They didn’t, you_
_know because I did ask at the beginning I was a bit_
_flummoxed with it all erm and I did ask the physio_
_that was there then and she, she had a look but she_
_couldn’t tell me, but I figured it out myself in the end._

[Patient 6]

##### Control Group

Most control group participants would have liked to see and
use the intervention but were usually happy to take part. A few
intervention participants felt they would have been disappointed
to receive the control condition but stated they would have
continued with the study:


_Well, I honestly felt a bit disappointed... because erm_
_I did want to experience trialling erm the Fitband_

_[sic] as it should be used... but I realise the_
_importance of that um, you need both aspects of it,_
_so, I was still happy to do it. [Patient 07, control]_
One control group participant who had no prior experience with
digital technology stated he would have withdrawn if he had
been allocated to the intervention group:

_I’d have probably put it back in box and have rung_
_em back up and said I don’t want to do it, it’s too_
_much for me this, I’m not into it. [Patient 25]_
When technical issues occurred, control group participants were
less likely to realize that there was a technical issue compared
with intervention group participants, as they could not see the
Fitbit display or the Fitbit app (unless they had discovered it).
When participants did realize that there was a technical issue,
it was usually because they were using the Fitbit app or noticed
the activity tracker no longer had a flashing light underneath:

_Well part of it was when it wasn’t working, which I_
_didn’t know, when I was unaware of that. [Patient 28]_
One control group participant had been given a Fitbit Charge
2, whose charging cradle differs from the Charge HR. For this
participant, the black tape covering the screen interfered with
the charging cradle, which caused weeks of problems getting
data from this participant (until the root cause was discovered).

##### Involvement in the Project

Participants did not generally contact the research team if they
were having problems using the technology or were
experiencing technical issues. These problems were usually
detected when members of the research team called participants
to arrange data collection visits. Some participants had lost the
research team’s contact details; others seemed reluctant to bother
researchers with issues they feared were due to their own
_incompetence or inexperience with technology:_

_No I’ve never contacted you. I was thinking about it_
_in the beginning because I wasn’t getting, as I say I_
_was a bit flummoxed by it all, but I figured it out so_
_I didn’t, I’ve not phoned up or anything, I’ve not had_
_any contact other than the visits. [Patient 6]_
One participant who was initially resistant to using technology
decided to try it after hearing the researcher’s explanation of
the study:

_Well when you when they first asked me, would I, you_
_know at pulmonary rehab, would I take one and I was_
_thinking no I can’t be doing with that, you know._
_Can’t be doing with that… because I didn’t_
_understand it… until it was explained and then I_
_thought, yes I’m going to have that, yes. [Patient 14]_
Participants enjoyed taking part in the study and were mostly
happy with their contact with the research team. Some
participants had purchased, or planned to purchase, their own
Fitbit to continue using after the study had finished:

_It would never have entered my head to go and buy_
_something to improve my condition, never, erm but_

JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Bentley et al


_now I’ve got another Fitbit waiting for me when I go_
_home. [Patient 03]_

##### Health Care Professionals: Reactions to the Technology

A total of 5 HCPs took part in either a focus group discussion
or an interview exploring their experiences of participating in
the study. Five themes relevant to HCPs’ experiences with the
technology are discussed: technology; recruitment;
communication; workload; and suggested improvements.

**Technology**
One physiotherapist (with personal experience of using activity
trackers) described the SMART-COPD app as _clunky and_
visually unattractive. The staff felt some participants were
motivated by the technology to achieve physical activity goals
between PR sessions, although they also noted that some
participants are naturally more motivated regardless of whether
they have technology.

**Recruitment**
The staff reported that some participants _got on with the_
technology better than others, and that it was usually (but not
always) younger and more technologically experienced
participants who adapted quickly and gained the most benefit.
However, 2 staff members pointed out that older people are
becoming more technologically experienced as the years
progress, so this may not be an issue for future generations.

The study did not have any inclusion criteria around previous
experience with technology. However, there were hints that a
small number of potential participants may not have been put
forward to the research team if staff members felt they would
not benefit from the intervention, eg, if they had never used
digital technology or did not seem motivated to benefit from
PR. The staff also heard a few control group participants
expressing disappointment with their allocation, eg, wondering
about the purpose of their involvement.

**Communication**
During the feasibility study preparation, the research team
conducted workshops with PR staff and involved them in
planning the logistics of the intervention and the study.
Unfortunately, it was (understandably) difficult to speak with
the entire PR team; therefore, not all staff were briefed in-person
on the study and technology, and key information did not always
filter through to the entire team. In addition, physiotherapists
within PR teams are frequently rotated to different locations.
In the time it took to complete development work and get ethical
amendments approved, some PR team members had changed,
and even those who were involved in earlier stages of the study
did not always recall how the technology or the study worked.

This was reflected in the staff interviews, in which
physiotherapists often reported that they did not know much
about the technology or the wider study. Owing to their own
experiences with technology, PR team members were more able
to help with generic smartphone issues but were not usually
experienced with using activity trackers or the SMART-COPD
app.


**Workload**
The study did not have a large impact on workload, as PR
physiotherapists are accustomed to speaking with individual
patients during PR sessions and checking their progress. One
difficulty, however, was that the research team was not always
told in good time when a new starter would be attending a PR
session, especially when this was decided at short notice or
when this coincided with staff absence on either side.
Physiotherapists sometimes reported difficulties deciding
appropriate physical activity goals for participants, as they did
not think in terms of the number of daily steps a person with
COPD should aim to achieve. There were also difficulties
organizing appointments for conducting F2 ISWT tests (which
were not a part of normal service delivery). Overall, it was felt
that the SMART-COPD intervention had become a tool used
alongside PR rather than incorporated within PR, although it
was thought in some cases to have enhanced people’s PR
experience and the benefits they gained from it.

**Suggested Improvements**
Suggestions for improving the study included a dedicated central
email list to improve communication and sharing of
responsibility for appointments and tasks. One HCP suggested
asking participants to wear a blinded activity tracker for a week
before starting the study to gain a better baseline physical
activity level. This would help with setting appropriate physical
activity goals for the individual and would help with working
out whether the intervention was effective for that individual.

### Discussion

##### Principal Findings

This randomized feasibility study examined the feasibility and
acceptability of using a wearable activity tracker and the
SMART-COPD app both within and following PR to encourage
people with COPD to increase, or at least maintain, their
physical activity levels (RQ1). The study also explored the
feasibility of conducting a future RCT to investigate the
effectiveness of the intervention (RQ2). The intervention shows
potential in helping a subset of people with COPD to achieve
physical activity goals. However, both the intervention and
methods used would need to be modified if a future RCT were
to be conducted.

##### Acceptability of the Intervention

A total of 30 people with COPD were recruited to the study.
The 16 participants who completed the study were generally
positive about the intervention (or liked the concept if they were
in the control group). Some believed they had gained tangible
benefits from using the intervention, both in terms of motivation
to achieve physical activity goals and subsequent benefits to
their physical or psychological health. Most participants who
completed the study found the technology easy to use and most
experienced no problems incorporating it into their daily lives.

However, almost half of the participants (n=14) withdrew from
the study. Some participants seemed to find the prospect of
using digital technology for physical activity monitoring to be
daunting or overwhelming. This was supported by the reasons
given for withdrawing, and qualitative feedback from both


-----

JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Bentley et al


patients and staff, which indicated that people who were older
or less experienced with digital technology or did not have
support at home might be wary of using this type of intervention.
Overall, people who withdrew from the study had worse baseline
scores on exercise capacity, quality of life, and depression
compared with those who completed the study, which indicates
that people with better COPD-related health may gain more
benefits from mHealth-based interventions. This claim must
however be interpreted with caution due to the small sample
size.

Although mHealth is a promising intervention for the
self-management of COPD, the evidence base around mHealth
is currently mixed and underdeveloped [46-48]. In this study,
there was arguably a dichotomy between people who completed
the study and gained perceived physical and psychological
benefits from the intervention and those who did not easily
adopt the technology or found it to be a burden. This has been
found for related interventions such as telehealth [46,49,50] and
supports McCabe et al’s [19] hypothesis that patients with
COPD with greater interest in technology may gain greater
benefits from mHealth interventions. In addition, a recent
literature review of wearable technologies for physical activity
in COPD identified only a small number of RCTs with highly
heterogeneous technologies and study designs, meaning no
conclusions could be drawn about their effectiveness [51]. More
evidence is needed on the use of wearables in COPD, along
with an improved ability for accurate step count detection, and
more robust guidelines are needed for clinical staff to implement
wearable technologies for COPD [51].

The SMART-COPD app itself mostly worked well. However,
one of the most challenging technical issues was the failure of
activity data to be transmitted from the activity tracker to its
corresponding smartphone app. This was frustrating for all
concerned as it meant some participants’ physical activity data
were not recorded, and indeed technical issues were cited by
several participants as a reason for withdrawing. The wrist-strap
also caused discomfort and could catch on clothes and fall off.
These issues would need to be resolved if the intervention were
to be used on a wider scale.

Although the intervention seemed acceptable as a tool for use
alongside standard PR, a full integration of the intervention
within service delivery was problematic. Communication errors
occurred between the research team and PR team despite the
best efforts of everyone involved. In addition, the logistical
difficulties of briefing entire PR teams, coupled with the
tendency of PR physiotherapists to be moved between teams,
resulted in some PR team members feeling uninformed about
the technology and the wider study. However, PR staff were
still supportive of the intervention, especially when participants
within their service told them about their positive experiences.

There are potential patient-level advantages to incorporating
the SMART-COPD intervention within PR, eg, access to clinical
support when first using the app. However, it is worth noting
that a large proportion of patients with COPD referred to PR
do not attend or do not complete the course [52,53]. Reasons
for nonattendance and noncompletion include perceived lack
of benefit, disruption to usual routine, poor access to transport,


greater disease severity, lower quality of life, and greater
symptoms of depression [53,54]. Even if the intervention were
deployed within PR in the future, a large number of people with
COPD would not have the opportunity to use this method of
self-managing their physical activity. Therefore, future research
should explore other ways of delivering mHealth interventions
to people with COPD who do not access PR.

##### Feasibility of the Study Design

Almost half of recruited participants dropped out of the study.
This finding has implications both for the acceptability of the
intervention and for the sample size of a future RCT, which
would need to account for high dropout rates. It could be argued
that the inclusion criteria should be modified to target people
with COPD who are deemed more likely to engage with this
type of intervention. However, 1 or 2 individuals readily adopted
the technology against their own or the physiotherapists’
expectations. HCPs in this study made the point that future
generations coming through PR are likely to have more
experience with digital technology and might therefore be more
likely to engage with mHealth. These points suggest that the
inclusion criteria should not exclude potential participants based
on age, (actual or perceived) COPD-related health, or (actual
or perceived) aptitude toward, or previous experience with,
technology.

Most outcome measures tested were found to be suitable for
use in a future RCT. The ISWT is routinely conducted in PR
and would be suitable as an outcome measure for exercise
capacity in a future trial. However, in this study, we were unable
to identify a suitable outcome measure for physical activity.
Fitbit One and Fitbit Charge were both accurate in counting
participants’ steps during the F2 ISWT (when compared with
Axivity sensor readings). However, control participants were
more likely to have gaps in their step count data, and so these
data are unlikely to have constituted an adequate comparison
if this was an RCT. In addition, although control group
participants could not see their step count on the Fitbit screen
or on the smartphone’s home screen, some control group
participants discovered the Fitbit app on the smartphone (a
necessity for recording step count data) and were able to see
their step counts. This meant that some control group
participants were monitoring their step counts despite the
_blinded activity tracker. Thus, it would currently be challenging_
to use step count as a between-group comparative outcome
measure in any future study. Participants also experienced
difficulties completing the CHAMPS questionnaire for physical
activity in older adults, thus ruling out this option as an outcome
measure for physical activity. One physiotherapist suggested
using a blinded activity tracker to take a baseline step count for
participants between their assessment visit and beginning PR,
which could provide a more reliable indication of physical
activity changes within individual participants rather than
between experimental groups in an RCT.

Some (though not all) participants were disappointed to be
assigned to the control group, and in some cases, it was difficult
for participants to appreciate the purpose of the control
condition. For a future study, this may be resolved by giving
all control group participants the opportunity to try using a

wearable activity tracker at some stage in the study, eg, after
data collection.

##### Implications for Future Development of the Intervention

Smartphones and wearables are two technologies predicted to
transform health care provision in the coming decades [21].
Participants who helped codevelop the SMART-COPD
intervention stressed the importance of being able to personalize
the intervention. This led to the inclusion of three different
strategies to encourage maintenance of physical activity.
However, when using the intervention in the real world, this
approach proved too complicated. The daily walk and exercise
components of the app were not widely used, and in some cases
proved confusing for participants and PR team members alike.
The more complex a technological intervention is, the less
usable it is likely to be [26], and problems with usability may
negatively impact participants’ motivation to continue with the
intervention or the behavior [18]. Although efforts were made
to design the intervention based on the needs and capabilities
of people with COPD, more could have been done to achieve
a truly co-designed intervention [55]. In addition, the
self-selected participants who helped codevelop the
SMART-COPD intervention were mostly experienced with
digital technology and may not have been fully representative
of the general COPD population.

Our results also suggest that people’s engagement with
technology might wane over time (as had happened with some
of our participants), although this study does not provide any
indication as to whether participants began disengaging from
the technology only or from the entire health behavior. This
pattern was not present for all participants and the use of
different components of the intervention differed between
participants, which implies there were individual differences in
how participants interacted with, and responded to, the
intervention.

This study shows that participants also need the capability [18]
to learn how to use the technology. People with less experience
of digital technologies may have had less capability to use the
intervention, and thus were more likely to leave the study.
Participants appeared to have differing experiences of the
SMART-COPD intervention depending on their previous
experience with digital technology and their baseline health.
This finding is indicative of the need to consider the
circumstances, motivations, and capabilities of individual
participants. The SMART-COPD intervention was complex,
and the COPD population is complex and has complex needs.
One intervention does not fit all, and future investigations of
similar mHealth-based interventions need to consider individual
factors as well as group factors when determining who could
gain the most benefit [19].

Our results suggest that a future version of the app would need
to be simplified. One option would be to adopt an existing
commercially available activity tracker (eg, Fitbit) and its
associated app to monitor step count and the completion of
individually relevant step count goals. This approach has the
benefit of not needing to be updated or maintained directly by
the (resource-limited) research team, instead relying on a


technology that is widely available and has a commercial team
developing and maintaining it. However, while the
SMART-COPD app was specifically designed to consider the
needs of users with COPD and included simplification of the
presentation of step count information collected via the activity
tracker, commercially available apps are not designed for this
population. Hence, we would need to determine whether patients
with COPD without prior experience with digital technology
could benefit from this approach (and, indeed, to ensure that
the motivational aspects of commercial apps are not harmful or
counter-productive for this population).

##### Strengths and Limitations

One strength of the feasibility study was that the SMART-COPD
intervention was tested with people with COPD in a real-life
setting, with real-life complexities and challenges, and over a
period of several months. The study involved both people with
COPD and relevant HCPs and tested out design elements of an
RCT. In addition, to our knowledge, no one has previously used
a wearable activity tracker to monitor step count for both an
experimental and a control group.

Potential limitations of the study include technical issues
affecting participants’ experiences of using the intervention,
and the effect of those issues on data completeness. The study
also experienced a high dropout rate. While this in itself
provided valuable information on the usability and acceptability
of the intervention, it also affected data completeness. We were
unable to formally interview these participants to fully
understand their experiences with the technology and their
reasons for leaving the study.

The resource-limited nature of the feasibility study meant we
were only able to include three PR sites: these sites may not
have been representative of PR services (and COPD populations)
across the United Kingdom. To practically conduct the study,
we also had to use more than one researcher for recruitment and
data collection. Researchers were trained on the use of the
technology and on how to introduce both the study and the
technology to participants. However, there may still have been
differences in how each researcher introduced and explained
the technology and the study, which may have influenced some
participants’ interactions with the technology.

However, all of the above strengths and limitation issues reflect
the wider complexities of assessing mHealth interventions in
real-world settings.

##### Conclusions

Overall, the SMART-COPD intervention was well liked and
perceived as easy to use and easy to incorporate into
participants’ daily lives by those who completed the study.
However, there was a high dropout rate which implies high
rates of people who were eligible for the intervention but who
did not easily adopt the technology, or else disliked the study
design (eg, because of allocation). The data suggest that people
with COPD who had worse baseline health were more likely to
withdraw from the study, which may indicate that this patient
group is harder to reach with mHealth interventions. The results
suggest the intervention would need to be simplified for future
use, eg, by focusing on step count only, with the possible sole

use of a wearable activity tracker and an associated app. This
finding contradicts a key finding from our earlier codevelopment
work, which emphasized the importance of having a
multi-option personalizable intervention. In a future RCT, the

intervention and either the ISWT or a within-subject measure
of step count should be considered as a primary outcome
measure. Any future evaluation of the intervention would need
to consider individual factors that affect the usability,
acceptability, and efficacy of the intervention.
