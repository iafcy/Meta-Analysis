Abstract

Objective: To study the effects of a lifestyle physical activity counseling program with feedback of a pedometer during pulmonary
rehabilitation.
Methods: Twenty-one chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients were randomized to an experimental group that followed a
regular rehabilitation program plus the counseling intervention or to a control group that only followed rehabilitation. The primary outcome
was daily physical activity assessed by pedometers. Secondary outcomes were physical fitness, health-related quality of life, activities of daily
living, depression and self-efficacy.
Results: The experimental group showed an increase of 1430 steps/day (+69% from baseline), whereas the control group showed an increase
of 455 steps/day (+19%) ( p = 0.11 for group � time interaction). The secondary outcomes showed no differences.
Conclusion and practice implications: This study showed that the use of the pedometer, in combination with exercise counseling and the
stimulation of lifestyle physical activity, is a feasible addition to pulmonary rehabilitation which may improve outcome and maintenance of
rehabilitation results.

1. Introduction

A major symptom experienced by patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is dyspnea during
exertion. This symptom often leads to lower physical
activity levels, which in turn may lead to deconditioning and
a reduction in health-related quality of life.
Pulmonary rehabilitation has proved to being able to
reverse this process, and the effects are well documented

[1–3]. However, long-term effects are less clearly defined.
Studies that have followed patients for a longer period show
that benefits diminish after about 1 year [4,5]. Ries et al. [5]
hypothesized that due to the unstable nature of their disease,

COPD patients may easily return to the spiral of inactivity
and deconditioning when an intensive maintenance strategy
is absent after the rehabilitation. Interestingly, home-based
pulmonary rehabilitation programs have proven to provide
long lasting effects, even after 5 years. One important feature
of these programs was the use of normal life style activities

[6–8].
We hypothesize that a physically active lifestyle of
patients with COPD is essential for maintaining the benefits
after rehabilitation. This can be achieved through lifestyle
physical activities like walking, cycling, stair-climbing and
gardening. By incorporating these activities during pulmonary rehabilitation, daily physical activity levels may
remain higher after rehabilitation and the benefits of
rehabilitation may last longer. The Dutch Norms for Healthy
Physical Activity (DNHPA), which is derived from the

norms of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)

[9–11], serve as reference for the effects of lifestyle physical
activities on health.
In this study, we tried to enhance daily physical activity in
patients with COPD by using a lifestyle physical activity
counseling program with feedback of a pedometer. Such a
program might be relevant for these patients because lifestyle
physical activity programs turn out to be very effective in
improving physical activity in healthy adults [12–14].
Because intensity and duration are interchangeable concerning energy expenditure in physical activity [15], lifestyle
physical activities of moderate intensity with longer duration
can replace high intensive physical activities of shorter
duration. Low to moderate intensity activities are more
appropriate for patients with COPD because of their low
exercise tolerance, which is due to ventilator limitation and
oxygen-uptake problems [16]. Furthermore, exercise counseling interventions have shown to be effective in increasing
physical activity [17,18] and are of interest in maintaining
physical activity [19], because they can be tailored to the
needs and circumstances of the individual [17,19]. Finally,
pedometers have proved to accurately detect stepstaken, as an
indication of volume of physical activity [20–22], and the
feedback of the pedometer can be an important resource in
increasing physical activity behaviors [23]. Pedometers offer
new perspectives in changing physical activity behavior
because patients can monitor themselves and can set concrete
goals for increasing physical activity. Up to now, several
studies have shown that pedometers are successful in
increasing physical activity in healthy adults [24,25] and in
various patient groups [26–30]. Scho¨nhofer et al. [31]
demonstrated that pedometers are feasible to assess the level
of physical activity in patients with COPD.
Consequently, a lifestyle physical activity counseling
program with continuous monitoring and feedback from a
pedometer may be a suitable strategy for increasing and
maintaining physical activity in patients with COPD. Until
now, no intervention studies have been carried out that used a
lifestyle physical activity counseling program with feedback
of a pedometer in patients with COPD. Before long-term
effects of this method can be measured, first the short-term
effects must be mapped out. Therefore, the purpose of this
study was to investigate the short-term effects of a lifestyle
physical activity counseling program with feedback of a
pedometer during a standard pulmonary rehabilitation on
daily physical activity. Secondary effects on physical fitness,
health-related quality of life, activities of daily living,
depression and self-efficacy were also measured.

2. Methods

2.1. Study design

Patients who were referred for pulmonary rehabilitation
were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control


group. Patients in the experimental group followed a
lifestyle physical activity counseling program with feedback
of a pedometer next to a regular pulmonary rehabilitation
program. The control group participated only in a regular
pulmonary rehabilitation program. Patients in both groups
were examined prior to the pulmonary rehabilitation
(pretest) and after 9 weeks of rehabilitation (posttest).
Descriptive characteristics and pulmonary function at
baseline were assessed during a standard intake investigation
prior to rehabilitation, and were carried out by the clinical
staff, who was blinded for group assignment.
In the control group, patients wore the pedometer 1 week
prior to the rehabilitation and 1 week during week 9 of their
rehabilitation. Patients in the experimental group wore the
pedometer for 10 weeks (1 week prior to rehabilitation and 9
weeks during rehabilitation). Patients were instructed to
wear the pedometer over the course of the entire day until
going to bed, and to record daily step counts in a diary.
Patients also recorded in their diary at which time they put
the pedometer on and at which time they put the pedometer
off.

2.2. Patients

Thirty patients entering pulmonary rehabilitation at the
Groningen University Center for Rehabilitation were
eligible. Twenty-nine patients agreed to take part in this
pilot study and signed a written informed consent. Criteria
for inclusion were diagnosis of COPD (Stages I–IV) [33],
aged between 40 and 85 years, and being able to read and
write in Dutch. Patients were excluded if they used a
wheelchair, if they had significant co-morbidity interfering
with rehabilitation, and if they were assigned to rehabilitation modules other than the physical modules.

2.3. Intervention

Patients in both the experimental and control groups
followed a regular pulmonary rehabilitation program
according to evidence-based guidelines from the American
College of Chest Physicians and the American Association
of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation [2]. The
rehabilitation program contained exercise training, dietary
intervention and psycho-educational modules.
The experimental group followed a lifestyle physical
activity counseling program with feedback of a pedometer
next to the regular pulmonary rehabilitation program. The
aim of this intervention was to stimulate patients to increase
their daily physical activity level by incorporating lifestyle
physical activities into daily life. Patients received exercise
counseling in order to motivate them to enhance physical
activity in daily life and wore a pedometer in order to
monitor changes in physical activity behavior. The
pedometer was used as a motivational and feedback tool

[29,30]. Lifestyle physical activities are physical activities
that belong to the daily activity pattern (e.g. walking,

cycling, stair-climbing and gardening). Physical therapists
carried out the exercise counseling after being trained. The
counselors followed the principles of motivational interview
technique [34,35]. Four individually exercise counseling
sessions were carried out during the course of the study.
Each session took approximately 30 min. The first
counseling session was carried out 2 weeks prior to rehabilitation and dealt with motivation for increasing physical
activity. In this session, the pedometer with user instructions
were given to the patient. The second counseling session was
carried out in week 1 of the rehabilitation and dealt with
goal-setting. The third counseling session was carried out in
week 5 of the rehabilitation and dealt with shifting
boundaries. Mean steps/day were evaluated and patients
were asked to set a goal for seeking their maximal physical
activity limit once (measured in numbers of steps). The
fourth counseling session was carried out in week 7 of
the rehabilitation and dealt with consolidation of physical
activity behavior. Patients were asked to set a goal for their
personal physical activity norm, which should be between
their mean steps/day until then and their maximal number
of steps.

2.4. Outcome measures

The primary outcome measure was daily physical activity
and was measured by the Yamax Digi-Walker SW-200
(Tokyo, Japan). In controlled laboratory settings, the Yamax
SW series pedometers have consistently been shown to be
among the most accurate. The SW-701 (which has the same
step count mechanism as the SW-200) consistently gave
values within 3% of actual steps taken during a self-paced
walk, on an individual basis (Cronbach’s a 0.99) [21].
Subsequently, the SW-200 pedometer was found to be 1 of
the 4 models (among 13) that accurately measures steps
taken during free-living physical activity [22]. Finally, the
SW-200 pedometer was found to have similar accuracy in
normal-weight, overweight and moderately obese individuals [36]. The SW-200 pedometer is easy to use. It is worn
on the belt or waistband and responds to vertical
accelerations of the hip during gait cycles.
Secondary outcome measures were physical fitness,
health-related quality of life, activities of daily living,
depression and self-efficacy. Physical fitness was measured
by the ‘chair stand test’ (reliability: test–retest correlation r
0.80), ‘the arm curl test’ (reliability: r 0.81), the ‘8-foot upand-go test’ (reliability: r 0.95) and the ‘2-min step test’
(reliability: r 0.90) [37,38]. The 2-min step test is an
alternative for the 6-min walk test, which is more space- and
time-consuming. The rate of perceived exertion (RPE)
during the 2-min step test is comparable to the RPE during
the 6-min walk test, 13.9 and 13.6, respectively, suggesting
that the exercise intensity of these two aerobic endurance
tests is similar [38].
Two instruments were used to measure health-related
quality of life, namely the St. George’s Respiratory


Questionnaire (SGRQ) [39], a disease-specific health status
questionnaire, and the RAND-36 [40], a generic health
status questionnaire. The SGRQ consists of 76 items that
measure 3 components: ‘symptoms’ (problems caused by
specific respiratory symptoms), ‘activity’ (restriction of
activities by dyspnea) and ‘impacts’ (impact on everyday
life caused by the disease) (reliability: test–retest correlation
r 0.92) [39]. The RAND-36, which is a Dutch translation of
the MOS 36-item Short-Form Health Survey [41], consists
of nine subscales. In this study, five subscales were used:
physical functioning (reliability: Cronbach’s a 0.92), vitality
(Cronbach’s a 0.82), bodily pain (Cronbach’s a 0.88),
general health perceptions (Cronbach’s a 0.81) and change
in health status (an one item subscale: no a available) [40].
Two instruments were used to measure activities of daily
living. Independent functioning in daily living was measured
by the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale (GARS) and
consists of 18 items about personal hygiene and household
activities of daily living (reliability: reported Cronbach’s a
range from 0.82 to 0.94) [42]. The Dutch Exertion Fatigue
Scale (DEFS) measured exertion fatigue in the spheres of
household, personal hygiene and social life. Exertion fatigue
is defined as fatigue that is directly related to activity. A low
score relates to less exertion fatigue in activities of daily
living (reliability: Cronbach’s a 0.91) [43].
Manifestations of depression were measured by the Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI) [44]. The BDI is a selfadministered 21-item self-report scale. The total score of the
BDI indicates levels of depression, 0–4: possible denial of
depression, 5–9: normal, 10–18: mild to moderate depression, 19–29: moderate to severe depression and 30–63:
severe depression (reliability: Cronbach’s a 0.81 for nonpsychiatric populations) [45].
Self-efficacy in physical abilities was measured by the
LIVAS [46], which is a Dutch version of the Perceived
Physical Ability Subscale of the Physical Self-Efficacy
Scale [47] (reliability: Cronbach’s a 0.70) [46].
Fat-free mass was measured by a bio-electrical impedance meter (Bodystat 1500). Fat-free mass index (FFMI)
was calculated by dividing fat-free mass (in kg) by the
square of height (in m[2]). Pulmonary function tests were
performed following accepted standards [48], using a
spirometer (Jaeger MS-IOS) and bodybox (Masterlab
version 4.52i).

2.5. Statistical analysis

Means and standard deviations (S.D.) were calculated for
most descriptive characteristics at baseline. The Mann–
Whitney test was used for interval and ratio data, the
Chi-square test for nominal and ordinal data to test for
significant differences between experimental and control
groups at baseline.
The primary outcome measure of daily physical activity
was mean steps/day for 7 days (a complete week) including
rehabilitation activity (7Rplus). Patients attended our clinic

3 days a week. The days of the week vary depending on the
module that the patients follow; (a) Monday, Wednesday and
Friday; (b) Monday, Wednesday and Thursday; (c) Tuesday,
Thursday and Friday. The remaining 4 days without
rehabilitation, including 1 weekend, formed the second
step-count variable: 4Rmin. The third step variable was
calculated by computing the weekend before pretest and
posttest to 4Rmin. This variable thus consists of mean steps/
day for 6 days without rehabilitation, including 2 weekends
(6Rmin).
Means and S.D.s as well as 95% confidence intervals (CI)
were calculated for most outcome measures. To facilitate
the interpretation of results, effect sizes (d), calculated
according to the method of Cohen [49], are also reported. An
effect size of 0.2 is regarded as a small effect, 0.5 as a
medium-sized effect, and 0.8 as a large effect [49].
Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test
for significant group � time interactions between the
experimental group and the control group, i.e. the effect
of the counseling intervention. Besides, the power was
calculated. This indicates the change to find a significant
result, when there is an effect in the population indeed.
Assumption of normality was tested with the Shapiro–
Wilk test. Assumption of equality of covariance matrices
was tested with the Box’s test. Statistical analysis was
performed with the Scientific Package of Social Sciences
(SPSS) version 11.5. A p-value < 0.05 (two-sided) was
considered statistically significant.


3. Results

Twenty-nine patients agreed to participate in this pilot
study. Eight patients did not meet the inclusion criteria: five
patients were excluded because they had no COPD and three
patients because of the assignment to a rehabilitation module
other than the physical modules. So, 21 patients were
randomized to either the experimental or the control group.
Five patients dropped out during the 9 weeks. Complete data
sets were obtained from 16 patients (Fig. 1, flow chart).
Descriptive characteristics at baseline are shown in
Table 1. There were no significant differences in descriptive
characteristics between both groups at baseline.

(6Rmin). This in contrast with the control group, in which
mean steps/day were increased by 1220 steps/day (+52%)
for 7Rplus and by 455 steps/day (+19%) for 6Rmin. Effect
sizes within the groups were large (>0.80) in the
experimental group for 7Rplus, 4Rmin and 6Rmin and
were smaller in the control group, especially for 4Rmin
and 6Rmin. The effect of the lifestyle physical activity
counseling program with feedback of a pedometer was not
statistically significant, but the between-groups effect size
was large (>0.80) for 6Rmin. The power was 37%.

Table 2 showed that there was a significant effect of the
intervention for the ‘8-foot up-and-go test’, but assumptions
were violated. The effect of the intervention was borderline
significant for the ‘2-min step test’ with a large betweengroups effect size (>0.80). No significant effects of the
intervention were found for the two other items of physical
fitness or for health-related quality of life (HRQoL),
activities of daily living (ADL), depression and self-efficacy.
Most effect sizes were small to medium.

4. Discussion and conclusion

4.1. Discussion

This study examined the effects of a lifestyle physical
activity counseling program with feedback of a pedometer


during 9 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation. The experimental group increased their mean steps/day by 1430 steps/
day (+69%) for 6 days without rehabilitation (6Rmin),
whereas the control group showed an increase of 455 steps/
day (+19%). The difference in pretest and posttest between
the experimental and control groups was clinically relevant,
with an effect size >0.80. However, this was not statistically
significant.
According to Tudor-Locke and Myers [50], older adults
and those living with chronic diseases typically walk
between 3500 and 5500 steps/day and would be classified as
sedentary (<5000 steps/day) according to the preliminary
classification of pedometer-determined physical activity in
healthy adults [23]. It is also noticed that this classification
might not be sustainable for older adults and those living
with chronic diseases. There are a few studies that measured
daily physical activity in patients with COPD with an
accelerometer [51–53] and with a pedometer [31]. Patients
in the latter study took approximately 3700 steps/day. In our
study, patients took approximately 2200 steps/day at baseline and approximately 3400 steps/day at posttest. This is far
less than Tudor-Locke and Myers [50] found in older adults
and individuals with a chronic disease. It is also less than
Scho¨nhofer et al. [31] found for patients with COPD. The
included patients in that study were on average younger
(56 � 12 years) but had approximately the same lung
function (FEV1 47 � 9% predicted) than the patients in our
study. This suggests that a reason for the low step count in
our study is the higher age of our patients. In this respect, it
has already been known that older adults take less steps/day

[23]. Another reason for the lower steps/day score can be
seasonal influences on daily physical activity. Energy
expenditure in daily physical activity and leisure-time
physical activity is significantly higher in spring and summer

[54–56]. Scho¨nhofer et al. [31] do not describe in which
season they carried out their study. Our study was carried out
in autumn and winter.
No study has been carried out yet that uses a pedometer as
a motivational and feedback tool together with exercise
counseling in order to increase daily physical activity in
patients with COPD. In two studies, healthy adults
significantly increase their daily steps from 8565 at baseline
to 10,538 (+23%) after an 8-week pedometer-based lifestyle
physical activity intervention [25], and from 4753 at
baseline to 7949 (+67%) after an 8-week pedometer-based
physical activity program [24]. The relative increases in
number of steps/day in our study were more pronounced.
This can be explained by the lower baseline score in our
study: it is easier to gain a relative increase from a low
starting-point than a high starting-point. But it could also be
explained by the additional value of exercise counseling.
Pedometer-based interventions are already successfully
used to increase physical activity in various other patient
groups as well [26–28]. The First Step Program (FSP) of
Tudor-Locke et al. [29,30] for individuals with type-II
diabetes is a pedometer-based lifestyle physical activity

intervention that corresponds largely with our lifestyle
physical activity counseling program with feedback of a
pedometer. A controlled outcome evaluation of the FSP
showed that individuals with type-II diabetes in the
experimental group increased their physical activity pattern,
relative to the control group, with >3000 steps/day [30].
There were a number of factors in this study that caused
methodological bias. The sample size of the study was small
and the S.D.s of steps/day were large which resulted in a low
power. In the same line, the low power probably accounts for
the non-significant results on the secondary outcome
measures. Five patients dropped out during the study. An
intention to treat analysis was not performed, because of the
drop-out reasons. Finally, one disadvantage of using
pedometers is that they are not sensitive to non-ambulatory
activities (e.g. cycling, swimming, weight-training). Nevertheless, walking is one of the most common forms of
activity, and aggregate evidence provides abundant support
for using pedometers to assess physical activity [57]. For
future research, it would be helpful to develop step
equivalents for the non-ambulatory activities, so that these
activities can be taken into account.

4.2. Conclusion

In summary, this study showed that the number of steps/
day increase after 9 weeks of rehabilitation. The additional
lifestyle physical activity counseling program with feedback
of a pedometer showed a clinically relevant increase in steps/
day, although not statistically significant, on top of the
rehabilitation effect. We expect that this method is in
particular of benefit in maintaining the results of rehabilitation. A trial on long-term effects would therefore be
desirable. However, further studies with larger patient
groups and longer follow-up periods are needed to establish
these preliminary results.

4.3. Practice implications

The pedometer is a device that has become very popular
in daily use as well as in science. They are simple in use,
affordable, the output (e.g. steps take, steps/day) is
extremely user-friendly [23] and accurately detects steps
taken, as an indication of volume of physical activity [20–
22]. This pilot study showed that the use of the pedometer, in
combination with exercise counseling and the stimulation of
lifestyle physical activity, is a feasible addition to the
present-day pulmonary rehabilitation. The costs of implementation and carrying out this program are minimal.
Moreover, this program can easily be adopted in different
settings. The patients who followed this lifestyle physical
activity counseling program with feedback of a pedometer
were very positive about this method and would recommend
it to other patients. Also the physiotherapist who carried out
the counseling sessions were enthusiast about this program.
In sequel to this pilot study, a trial on long-term effects


would be desirable. We think that this lifestyle physical
activity counseling program with feedback of a pedometer is
of use in chronic patients such as COPD in adopting a more
physical active lifestyle.
