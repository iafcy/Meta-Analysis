##### ABSTRACT Rationale Reduced physical activity (PA) in patients with COPD is associated with a poor prognosis. Increasing PA is a key therapeutic target, but thus far few strategies have been found effective in this patient group. Objectives To investigate the effectiveness of a 12- week semiautomated telecoaching intervention on PA in patients with COPD in a multicentre European randomised controlled trial. Methods 343 patients from six centres, encompassing a wide spectrum of disease severity, were randomly allocated to either a usual care group (UCG) or a telecoaching intervention group (IG) between June and December 2014. This 12-week intervention included an exercise booklet and a step counter providing feedback both directly and via a dedicated smartphone application. The latter provided an individualised daily activity goal (steps) revised weekly and text messages as well as allowing occasional telephone contacts with investigators. PA was measured using accelerometry during 1 week preceding randomisation and during week 12. Secondary outcomes included exercise capacity and health status. Analyses were based on modified intention to treat. Main results Both groups were comparable at baseline in terms of factors influencing PA. At 12 weeks, the intervention yielded a between-group difference of mean, 95% CI (lower limit – upper limit; ll-ul) +1469, 95% CI (971 to 1965) steps/ day and +10.4, 95% CI (6.1 to 14.7) min/day moderate PA; favouring the IG (all p≤0.001). The change in 6-min walk distance was significantly different (13.4, 95% CI (3.40 to 23.5) m, p<0.01), favouring the IG. In IG patients, an improvement could be observed in the functional state domain of the clinical COPD questionnaire (p=0.03) compared with UCG. Other health status outcomes did not differ. Conclusions The amount and intensity of PA can be significantly increased in patients with COPD using a 12-week semiautomated telecoaching intervention including a step counter and an application installed on a smartphone. Trial registration number: NCT02158065.

 INTRODUCTION
Based on overwhelming evidence, regular physical
acti it (PA) is at present seen as one of the most

powerful health-promoting acts.[1] Physical inactivity
is the fourth leading cause of death, attributing to
>5 million premature deaths worldwide.[2] Also,
6–10% of major non-communicable disease burden
is caused by inactivity.[2] Despite this evidence, a
large proportion of healthy elderly people do not
meet PA recommendations.[2] Patients with chronic
disease show an even more pronounced inactive
lifestyle.[3] This is particularly true when exercise
induces symptoms.
COPD is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, resulting in a substantial economic and social
burden.[4] Patients with COPD are less active than
age-matched controls.[5] In this patient population,
low levels of PA are an independent risk factor for
mortality and hospitalisation.[6 7] Generally, activity
level decreases with increasing disease severity but
inactivity is not simply a reflection of lung function
impairment.[8 9] Activity promotion is included as a
key element in the recommendations for the management of patients with COPD 4 although there


-----

are, thus far, few interventions of proven efficacy. In particular,
both pulmonary rehabilitation programmes[10] and pharmacotherapy,[11 12] while of proven benefit in other respects, have led to
small and inconsistent increases in PA.
PA is a complex health behaviour; consequently, effective
behaviour change interventions need to reflect this. In chronically ill patients, larger improvements on PA have been observed
in intervention studies where behaviour strategies (goal setting,
contracting, feedback, consequences and/or cues) were
included.[13] Activity monitors can provide direct feedback,
which has shown promise in COPD, in combination with goal
setting.[14 15] Implementing behaviour strategies can be done by
face-to-face contacts between patients and clinicians. However,
such interventions are relatively time-consuming and may
depend on the skills and training of the clinicians involved,
making it more difficult for them to be widely adopted.
Electronic information and communication technologies offer
the possibility of decreasing the burden on clinicians and
patients, standardising interventions and making them available
to people who live in remote areas or in areas where access to
healthcare providers is limited (‘telecoaching’).[16]

One study in the USA has shown the effectiveness of a solely
internet-based telecoaching programme on PA in patients with
COPD, observing improvements in both health-related quality
of life and in PA.[17] Various health-related applications
(‘m-health’), focusing on PA, are available on the market,[18] but
applications tailored for patients with COPD have not yet been
developed nor tested. We hypothesised that a smartphone application, specifically designed for the intended population and
allowing human contact if needed, across the whole spectrum of
COPD, would offer insight into the potential effectiveness of
such an intervention on the PA level.
We therefore assessed the effectiveness of a 12-week PA promotion telecoaching programme in addition to usual care in a
multicentre trial including patients with COPD. This study
forms part of the European IMI-JU PROactive project.

##### METHODS Study population
Patients with a physician-based diagnosis of COPD,[4] age >40
with a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years, who were not
actively participating in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme
at the moment of inclusion (or did not plan to start),
were enrolled at six centres across Europe (Leuven (Belgium),
Athens (Greece), London and Edinburgh (the UK), Zurich
(Switzerland) and Groningen (The Netherlands)); these centres
were chosen in order to recruit patients with a range of severity
of COPD. Patients were excluded if they had any comorbidity
limiting a normal activity pattern, had another respiratory
disease as primary diagnosis or were unable to understand or
operate a smartphone device. Stable patients as well as patients
having an acute exacerbation in the last month were included in
this trial. Patients using walking aids or those on long-term
oxygen treatment were as well included in the trial.

##### Design
The trial consisted of three visits—a screening visit (V1), a randomisation visit (V2) 1–2 weeks later and a final visit (V3),
12 weeks post randomisation. In this 1:1 randomised controlled
trial, patients were allocated in either a control group (UCG)
receiving usual care or in an intervention group (IG).
The random sequence was generated with varying block sizes of
4, 6 or 8 and stratified by centre using a statistical software
(STATA V12 0 StataCorp College Station Te as USA) After


obtaining informed consent and when all inclusion criteria were
met at V2, investigators obtained group allocation using an
online system that ensured concealment of random allocation.

##### Usual care
Patients in both groups received a standard leaflet explaining the
importance of PA in COPD as well as information about PA
recommendations. This leaflet was discussed with all patients in a
5–10 min one-to-one discussion with the investigator during V2.
The usual medical treatment was not altered throughout the study.

##### Intervention
Patients in the IG received the usual care plus the telecoaching
intervention. This intervention included several components: (1)
a one-to-one interview with the investigator during V2 discussing motivation, barriers, favourite activities and strategies to
become more active; (2) a step counter (Fitbug Air) providing
direct feedback on the step count, on a 2 × 3 cm display; (3)
smartphone with Fitbug application and a project-tailored
coaching application. This application was specifically designed
for use by patients with COPD in the present project. It provided automated coaching by displaying an activity goal
(number of steps) and feedback on a daily basis. The feedback
included a graphical representation of that day’s performance
and an educational tip. Patients’ targets were automatically
revised every Sunday, based on performance in the preceding
week (figure 1). Investigators could alter or ‘lock’ the goals if
needed, based on interaction with the patient; (4) a booklet containing home exercises; (5) weekly group text message with
activity proposals sent by the investigator, taking into account
the local weather forecast; and (6) telephone contacts triggered
in the case of non-compliance with wearing the step counter,
failure to transmit data or failure to progress. More information
[is provided in the online supplementary material.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-209026)

##### Assessments Physical activity
PA was objectively measured with the Dynaport Movemonitor
(DAM, McRoberts BV, The Hague, the Netherlands) and
Actigraph GT3x (ACT, Actigraph LLC Pensacola, Florida, USA)
for two periods; 1 week preceding V2 and 1 week preceding
V3. Patients were asked to wear the monitors whenever awake.
These triaxial accelerometers, worn around the waist, have been
thoroughly validated in COPD.[19 20] Outputs from the activity
monitors used for assessment were not available for patients. A
valid PA measurement was defined as a minimum of two weekdays with at least eight hours of wearing time, with weekends
excluded from the analysis[21] [(rationale in online supplementary](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-209026)
[material). The increase in the number of steps per day over](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-209026)
3 months was chosen as primary outcome. Time in at least moderate intense PA (MPA), walking time and movement intensity
during walking were chosen as secondary PA outcomes.
Sedentarism has been defined as a step count lower than 5000
steps,[22] and for responder analysis a clinically significant
increase in step count was defined as ≥1000 steps.[23] Although
we collected data from two monitors, we report data from the
ACT in terms of step count and MPA (‘Freedson 2011’[24]), while
walking time and intensity during walking are based on the
DAM, more information about these decisions is included in the
[online supplementary material.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-209026)

##### Other assessments
Postbronchodilator spirometry was performed following
ATS E ropean Respirator Societ (ERS) recommendations[25]

during V1 and V3, data were related to reference values.[26] The
following clinical outcomes were collected at V2 and V3. (1)
Functional exercise capacity measured as the best of two 6-min
walk tests, following ATS-ERS guidelines;[27] (2) isometric quadriceps force (QF) measured with the patient fixed in 90° hip and
knee flexion;[28] and (3) health status measured using the COPD
assessment test (CAT) and the clinical COPD questionnaire
(CCQ). Breathlessness was measured using the modified Medical
Research Council (mMRC) questionnaire. Exacerbation history in
the last 12 months, demographic data, medical history including
comorbidities and anthropometric data were obtained and a physical examination was performed during V1.

##### Quality control, safety and time consumption
In two rounds (one during the initial phase and one after
recruitment had been completed), investigators from each site
visited in a random order another site to assess protocol deviations, verify data and ensure standardisation of procedures.
Adverse events were collected during the course of the trial as
well as by direct questioning during the final visit. All contacts
with patients were logged in the electronic case report file by
the investigators including the reason for and duration of the
contact.

##### Statistics
Based on a between-group difference of 1500 steps/day, an SD
of 3400 steps/day and a dropout rate of 20%, a need of 68
patients in each arm (total of 136) was calculated for obtaining
90% power using an α level of 0.05 (two-sided). The sample
size calculation is based on repeated measurements between two
[groups and is detailed in the online supplementary material. All](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-209026)
statistical analyses were performed using the SAS statistical
package (V.9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). All
analyses were based on a statistical analysis plan a priori
accepted by all authors. Data are presented as mean±SD or
median (Q1–Q3). Statistical significance was set at p<0.05 for
all these analyses. All randomised patients were encouraged to
ret rn for the final isit and considered for these modified


intention-to-treat analyses. No imputation was made for missing
data, interpreted as ‘missing at random’.
Between-group differences were analysed using an analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) model to adjust for potentially confounding factors judged to be distributed unevenly between
groups. End-of-study variables were used as the dependent variable, the baseline variable as a covariate and the group factor as
the explanatory variable whose effect is to be tested. Because
randomisation was performed by centre, the adjustment by
centre was tested. Goodness of fit was assessed by means of normality of residuals. ORs for achieving a 1000 steps/day increase
in PA, defined as the minimal important difference,[23] were
calculated.
As an exploratory analysis, we investigated the intervention
effect in different subgroups. Similar ANCOVA analyses as previously mentioned were performed, including the subgroup and
interaction subgroup×group factor. The different subgroups
were based on baseline data of mMRC (<2 vs ≥2), median split
of 6-min walk distance (6MWD) (<450 vs ≥450 m), comorbidity (<2 vs ≥2), Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung
Disease (GOLD) quadrants (A–B vs C–D) and baseline step
count (<5000 vs ≥5000 steps/day).

##### RESULTS Study population
Of the 368 enrolled patients, 343 were randomised (figure 2),
between June and December 2014. Baseline characteristics were
comparable between groups with regard to factors influencing
PA (see table 1). In total, 13 patients in the control and 12 in
the IG dropped out (figure 2). Patients who dropped out had a
lower body mass index (BMI) (p<0.01), worse QF (p<0.01)
and a worse health status (p=0.02) compared with completers
[(see online supplementary material).](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-209026)
Main PA analyses are based on 140 UCG and 140 IG patients
with valid ACT measurements on both time points. Patients
without valid PA data had slightly worse lung function
(FEV1%pred) compared with those included in the PA analyses
[(see online supplementary material). The 280 patients included](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-209026)

weekdays with a wearing time of 806±120 min and 4.6±0.7
weekdays with a wearing time of 785±120 min, respectively,
during the baseline and final measurement (no differences
between groups). Daylight during the baseline measurement of
these patients (745±150 min) as well as changes in daylight
(−164±162 min) were comparable between groups. None of
the considered confounders remained in the ANCOVA analyses.
Patients in the IG (n=140) wore the Fitbug step counter for a
median (Q1–Q3) of 91 (84–98) % of the days they were
included in the coaching programme, representing 6.3 (5.8–6.8)
days/week.

##### Physical activity
IG patients had an increase over controls of mean, 95% CI
(lower limit – upper limit; ll-ul) 1469, 95% CI (973 to 1965)
steps/day (29% from baseline) and 10.4, 95% CI (6.1 to 14.7)
min/day MPA (44% from baseline), p≤0.001 for all. PA
increased in the patients in the IG (median (Q1–Q3) 4305
(2841–5851) to 4767 (3080–7949) steps/day; 14 (5–26) to 18
(6–48) min MPA) and decreased in the UCG (4643 (2932–
6955) to 4059 (2624–6332) steps/day; 15 (5–35) to 14 (3–32)
min MPA). Results were comparable for both accelerometers
[used (see online supplementary material and figure 3). Including](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-209026)
centre in the analyses did not change the results.
Patients in the IG were 4.44, 95% CI (2.38 to 8.29) times
more likel to ha e a 1000 steps increase (51 (36%) s 16


(11%) patients, p<0.001). Patients with a lower score on the
mMRC (p=0.001), those with a better 6MWD (p=0.001) and
patients in GOLD A-B (p=0.05) at baseline showed a larger
intervention effect. There was no difference based on the
baseline PA (p=0.48) or having comorbidities (p=0.30) (see
figure 4).

##### Other outcomes
The analyses of the other outcomes are based on all patients
who completed the study (n=159 in both groups) with data on
both baseline and final visit; more information is given in
table 2. The change in functional capacity was small but significantly different between IG and UCG (13.4, 95% CI (3.4 to
23.5) m, p=0.01). An improvement could be observed in the
functional state domain of the CCQ (p=0.03). Other domains
of the CCQ, QF or CAT scores were not affected by the intervention (see table 2).

##### Adverse events and contact time
In total, 48 patients (30%) in the control and 43 patients (27%)
in the IG experienced at least one exacerbation (p=0.54)
during the trial, 5 of which led to hospitalisation. Lung function
variables during the final visit were not different from baseline
variables in either group.
Eleven musculoskeletal events were described in the IG compared ith t o in the UCG (p 0 01) none ca sing st d

discontinuation. Of those in the IG, only one event required
treatment (knee inflammation). One patient experiencing back
pain was advised to lower his PA in the acute situation. Another
patient with back pain was observed for 1 day in hospital,
without any treatment being initiated. Three events were judged
as possibly related to the intervention by the investigators (two
patients with back pain, one patient with a rib fracture), one
event (back pain) was judged as unlikely related. Other adverse
events, all not related to the study protocol, were cardiovascular
problems (n=2), diagnosis of a toe melanoma (n=1), urinary
problems (n=2), and gastrointestinal problems (n=3).
Patients in the IG who completed the trial were contacted for
a median (Q1–Q3) of 6 (4–9) times (range 0–25 times), with a
total time consumption for the investigator of 50 (30–95) min
per patient (range 0–375 min). Seventy-five per cent of contacts
were initiated by the application (‘flags’), the minority (25%)
were patient driven. More details are available in the online

##### DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of a 12-week semiautomated telecoaching intervention in increasing PA in a broad
spectrum of COPD. Patients with a better exercise capacity and
those with less symptoms had a more favourable response.

##### Strengths and weakness of the study
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multicentre trial
showing the effectiveness of a telecoaching intervention in
patients with COPD using triaxial accelerometry as an outcome
measure. The paper reports on the effect of the intervention on
patients included in six centres across Europe, including
primary, tertiary care and rehabilitation centres, which increases
the generalisability of the results. This study included people
ith a ide spectr m of disease se erit and a ide range of PA


levels without excluding patients who were ‘active’ at the start
of the programme nor those not able to leave the house, as can
be observed by the representation of all mMRC scores. Because
of these liberal inclusion criteria, the present trial is likely to be
relevant to patients seen in routine clinical practice. By providing a smartphone, the inclusion did not depend on any previous
experience, even in this elderly population. Only four patients
dropped out of the study because they were not able to work
with the smartphone application. It could be argued that the
intervention would have attracted the more educated COPD
population, leading to a possible problem of external validity.
This would nevertheless not have changed the interpretation of
the present results. The feasibility of using smartphones for
wireless transmission (via 4G) of data in this population is in
line with previous studies.[29 30] The algorithm used to revise the
targets every week was based on having at least four days of
step counter data. Compliance was not an issue as patients wore
the step counter >6 days out of 7. Whether the intervention
translates to long-term maintenance of higher PA levels has not
yet been investigated.
Some remarks should be made concerning the interpretation
of our results. Based on the present study, we cannot state
whether all component parts of this intervention were essential.
Providing a step counter in combination with goal setting could
potentially be equally effective.[15] The present application
however, using a more complex technology interface, allowed
clinicians to have insight into the compliance of patients and
intervene if patients were unable to cope with the preset goals.
Another advantage of such interventions is the standardisation
of the intervention, avoiding bias related to the investigator providing the coaching. This makes the intervention, on the one
hand, feasible to investigate in a multicentre trial and, on the
other hand, it is potentially applicable to routine clinical practice
without specific expertise requirements One could argue that

the different parts of the intervention, or the combination of
these, rather than the medium used to provide these (smartphone) were essential. In this case, the present intervention
could be provided by any kind of modern communication (eg,
internet-mediated via any interface). The present authors are
convinced that the intervention can be adapted to the preference of communication given by the patient or patient population. It could as well be debated that the contact with the
investigator rather the telecoaching could have resulted in the
present results. However, this is unlikely as adding a behavioural
intervention based on face-to-face contacts in patients following
a rehabilitation programme did not result in an enhanced PA
level.[31]

It is of interest that in both the IG and the UCG group the
non-completers had a more severe disease judged by quadriceps
strength, BMI and CAT score; moreover, those unable to undertake valid PA monitoring had a lower FEV1. This mirrors previous findings that these patients are less likely to complete an
intervention.[32] We acknowledge therefore that some patients
with the most severe disease may need a more personal
approach such as participation in a pulmonary rehabilitation
programme before they engage in PA coaching programmes.
The IG patients reported more musculoskeletal problems compared with the UCG. This information should be interpreted
with some caution as the frequency of contact with patients in
the IG was higher; patients in the UCG only reported adverse
events at the end of the trial. Knowing that almost none of
these events required any treatment, it may be that mild adverse
events were therefore under-reported in the UCG. This bias
could have been minimised by providing a diary to patients in
the control group. On the other hand, minor transient musculoskeletal problems are not unexpected when sedentary people
start an activity programme. PA is highly dependent on the
season of measurement.[33] Therefore, a limitation of the present
trial is the narrow inclusion between June and December 2014.
This can be seen as by the mean decrease in daylight over time,
a proxy for season. This likely explains the decrease in PA seen
in the control group. Although this influences the within-group
results, it does not change the between-group comparisons as
the groups were randomly assigned and therefore comparable
(including change in daylight). Our results show that patients
can be motivated to be active, even during periods of worse
weather conditions. Lastly, neither patients nor investigators
were blinded to treatment allocation. However, by using the
objective PA measurement, the lack of blinding of investigator
will not have influenced the primary end point. Nevertheless,
we do acknowledge the lack of blinding could have minimally
influenced the 6MWD results.

##### Comparison with other studies
Several studies have used step counters to provide real-time
feedback on PA in combination with goal setting in comparable
patient groups.[14] 15 17 The weighted mean effect of these
studies was 1259 steps/day improvement over controls. One
study, which used a pedometer intervention and monthly
face-to-face meetings, showed a significantly larger effect.[15] In
that study, exercise capacity was relatively well preserved (463 m
6MWD), perhaps providing more window for improvement as
there was a larger functional reserve.[34] It is clear that coaching
programmes with the specific aim of increasing PA lead to larger
improvements in amount of PA compared with rehabilitation,[35]

and pharmacology.[11 12] In the present study, patients in the IG
ere fo r times more likel to increase their PA b >1000


steps. This increment was defined a priori because it has been
defined as the minimal important difference[23] and because of its
relation with the decreased risk for COPD-related hospitalisation or mortality.[36] The present intervention was effective irrespective of patients’ baseline PA being above or below 5000
steps. Shifting to more active PA provides additional health benefits in healthy elderly and special populations.[3] This supports
the concept that aiming for an increase in PA level to lift
patients above the ‘sedentary lifestyle index’ of 5000 steps,[22] or
the ‘active’ threshold of 7500 steps,[3] is important. The objective
of this intervention was to enhance PA by empowering patients
and motivating them to engage in more daily activity. It comes
as no surprise that the intervention, while successful in enhancing PA, had only a minimal impact on exercise capacity and
muscle strength. This observation is in line with others[15] and is
likely due to the relatively low intensity of PA, insufficient to
enhance skeletal muscle function. Indeed, the time in MPA only
increased by 10 min/day. This may yield health benefits but is
not an adequate exercise training stimulus to incur in training
effects in the peripheral muscle. Our findings are likely important from a healthcare perspective since the present intervention
could easily be combined with a formal exercise training intervention or other interventions with a more direct impact on
exercise capacity potentiating the effects of both interventions.

##### Future perspectives
The present intervention should be seen as a promising tool as
an increased number of patients own a smartphone (mobile
broadband is the most dynamic Information and communications technology (ICT) market segment with a 12-fold increase
in users worldwide between 2007 and 2015[37]). In the present
study, patients were equipped with a smartphone. The intervention will become more clinically available and cost-effective if
patients own their own smartphone device. It can be envisaged
that this intervention can be embedded in a broader healthcare
intervention using a smartphone (m-health). In any case, the
coaching tools available on the market should be adapted for
users with chronic diseases. Given the limited effect of this
intervention on exercise capacity, the impact of delivering this
telecoaching intervention in the context of a pulmonary
rehabilitation programme or further optimised pharmacotherapy
could be a future investigation.

##### CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the present study shows the effectiveness of a
12-week semiautomated telecoaching programme (application
installed on a smartphone device) and a step counter providing
direct feedback on total daily number of steps, walking time,
time in at least moderate PA and movement intensity during
walking in patients with COPD across the whole disease
spectrum.
