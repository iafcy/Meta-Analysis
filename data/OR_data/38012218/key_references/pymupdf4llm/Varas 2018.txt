### Abstract

#### Background and Purpose: The exercise training included in pulmonary rehabilita
 tion (PR) programmes improves exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with

 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Nevertheless, the duration of these

 effects is limited, and the implementation of PR is still insufficient. Moreover, the

 physical activity level of COPD patients is low, and it is not modified with the classic

 PR programmes. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a community‐

 based PR programme designed to increase physical activity in COPD patients.

 Methods: Stable COPD patients were assigned to either an experimental group (EG,

 n = 17) who followed a community‐based 8‐week programme consisting of exercise train
 ing through walking and a plan to increase activity, using a pedometer for feedback; or a

 control group (n = 16), who followed general recommendations to walk more every day.

 The following were evaluated postintervention, after 3 months, and after 12 months:

 exercise capacity (endurance shuttle test [EST]), physical activity (steps/day and modified

 Baecke questionnaire), quality of life (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]),

 dyspnoea (modified Medical Research Council scale), and exacerbations.

 Results: Postintervention, the EG showed significant improvements in EST times

 (7.6 min [4.4, 10.7]), distance (549 m [282, 815]; p < 0.01, both), number of steps (3,361

 [1,553, 5,118]), and Baecke scores (1.6 [0.2, 3.1], p < 0.01). SGRQ scores decreased

 (−5.4 [−8.6, −2.4], p < 0.01). These results remained evident after 3 and 12 months

 (p < 0.01). There were no differences between the groups nor in the exacerbations or

 dyspnoea. A significant association was found between increase in physical activity level,

 improvement in exercise capacity, and quality of life during the period monitored.

 Conclusions: A community‐based programme of exercise training through walking

 and increased physical activity, using pedometers as feedback, produces short‐ and

 long‐term improvements in exercise capacity, physical activity level, and quality of life

 in COPD patients.

### 1 | INTRODUCTION

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by

chronic airflow obstruction, multisystem affectation, and exercise

intolerance GOLD (2017) (Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Manage
ment, and Prevention of COPD); the last characteristic can be

improved through pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Nevertheless, despite

the well‐known benefits provided by PR programmes (McCarthy et al.,

2015; Spruit et al., 2013), their implementation is limited (Rochester

et al., 2015). Self‐administered programmes are an interesting option

to increase PR coverage, offering similar benefits to supervised modal
ities (Vieira, Maltais, & Bourbeau, 2010). Programmes of this type,

which use walking as a system of training, have been described in

the medical literature (de Sousa Pinto, Martín‐Nogueras, Calvo‐

Arenillas, & Ramos‐González, 2014; Dias et al., 2013; Liu et al.,

2008; Mitchell et al., 2014; Pradella et al., 2015).

Moreover, the duration of the effects of PR is limited, with decline

beginning after 6–12 months (Spruit et al., 2013). For this reason,

maintenance interventions are necessary, but there are few studies

that have been conducted, and they are heterogeneous and show

modest results (Busby, Reese, & Simon, 2014).

On the other hand, physical activity level (PAL) of COPD patients is

generally low (Pitta, Troosters, Spruit, Decramer, & Gosselink, 2005).

Because inactivity has a negative influence on evolution of COPD (Hill,

Gardiner, Cavalheri, Jenkins, & Healy, 2015), it is necessary to identify

strategies to modify patients' habits (Spruit et al., 2013; Watz et al.,

2014). Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that classic PR has

any effect on patients' PALs (Mantoani, Rubio, McKinstry, MacNee, &

Rabinovich, 2016; Spruit, Pitta, McAuley, ZuWallack, & Nici, 2015),

whereas a combination of training and behavioural interventions does

appear effective (Hill et al., 2015; Lahham, McDonald, & Holland,

2016; Mantoani et al., 2016), especially in programmes that establish

sequential objectives and formal feedback systems (Leidy et al., 2014).

Pedometers are portable and easy to use and have been shown to

be effective monitoring systems in other programmes that aimed

at increasing PAL in different populations (Bravata et al., 2007;

Vaes et al., 2013). They are known to help increase PAL in people

with COPD (Mantoani et al., 2016; Spruit et al., 2013), although

there are no unified criteria for their utilization and there is little

evidence regarding duration of the effects of these programmes

(Mantoani et al., 2016).

Therefore, given the need to develop effective and lasting

interventions making PR more available and increasing PALs in the

COPD community, we have proposed this study. We hypothesized

that a simple, community‐based exercise training programme based

on walking, associated with a plan to increase PAL and using a pedom
eter as feedback, would be more effective than general

recommendations to walk more every day and that those effects

would be maintained for longer periods. The primary objective

was to assess the short‐, medium‐, and long‐term effects of this

programme on exercise capacity and PAL in people with COPD.

Secondary objectives included the following: (a) assessing the

programme's effects on quality of life, dyspnoea, and exacerbations


### 2 | METHODS

 2.1 | Study design and subjects

This study consisted of a randomized and controlled clinical trial with a

monitoring period of 12 months, comparing a community‐based exer
cise training programme associated with a plan to increase PAL to gen
eral recommendations of walking. It was conducted at the Escuela

_Universitaria de Fisioterapia de la ONCE (Universidad Autónoma de_

_Madrid), after approval by the ethics and clinical research committees_

of the hospitals that collaborated in the recruitment process.

COPD patients diagnosed according to the Global Obstructive

Lung Disease Initiative criteria (GOLD 2017 Global Strategy for the

Diagnosis, Management and Prevention of COPD) were eligible for

inclusion, who experienced no exacerbations in the 4 weeks prior to

the study, exertional dyspnoea, and low habitual PAL (less than

30 min of moderate exercise per day; Miravitlles et al., 2012). They

agreed to participate and signed informed consent forms. We

excluded subjects who had difficulty walking, those with cardiovascu
lar diseases (except high blood pressure), and those who had partici
pated in a PR programme over the previous 12 months. Recruitment

was conducted by the pulmonology consultants of the aforemen
tioned hospitals, using an intentional system of consecutive series.

Patients were allocated to one of two groups (experimental or

control) through simple randomization, using a system of random

numbers generated by Microsoft[®] Excel 2010. Correspondence

between numerical codes and study group was only available to

researchers in charge of the treatment, not to evaluators. Likewise,

participants were not aware of the interventions applied to the other

group, and contact between the two groups was avoided at all times.

### 2.2 | Measurements

Patients were assessed preintervention (Week 0), postintervention

(Week 10), and both 3 and 12 months postintervention.

The main variables consisted of the following: (a) exercise

capacity, assessed through the endurance shuttle test (EST; Holland

et al., 2014), using as walking speed 80% of the maximum speed in

the incremental shuttle test (Holland et al., 2014). Time and distance

achieved were measured, as well as functional variables. (b) PAL was

assessed through the following:

 - Average number of steps/day registered over seven consecutive

days, using the OMRON Walking Style X Pocket HJ‐320e digital

pedometer (Omron Healthcare Inc., Illinois), validated for use with

COPD patients (Moy et al., 2010). The patients were required to

carry the pedometer attached to their waist, next to their right

hip, throughout the entire day, and could only take it off if they

were lying down to rest. The pedometer's reliability was assessed

for each subject by comparing the number of steps registered by

the device to a manual count of steps when walking at the usual

speed in a 20‐m circuit. Patients whose variability between both

measurements was above 10% were excluded (Moy et al., 2010).

 - The modified Baecke physical activity questionnaire, which is specif

-----

The secondary variables were as follows: (a) quality of life,

measured with the Spanish version of St. George's Respiratory Ques
tionnaire (SGRQ), validated for use with COPD patients (Güell et al.,

1998); (b) dyspnoea, assessed through the modified scale of the

Medical Research Council (Task group on surveillance for respiratory

hazards in the occupational setting & Brooks, 1982); and (c) number

of exacerbations over the last 12 months (worsening of at least two

of the usual symptoms—dyspnoea, quantity, and colour of the

sputum—lasting more than 24 hr; Seemungal, Donaldson, Bhowmik,

Jeffries, & Wedzicha, 2000).

### 2.3 | Intervention

All participants received five group sessions of respiratory physiother
apy. These sessions were run by the same physiotherapist in both

groups and included ventilation techniques, bronchial clearance, tho
racic mobilization, and education. This initial intervention, considered

as “standard care” in a PR programme, has shown no influence in the

variables we analysed (Spruit et al., 2013). The specific intervention

then began for each group.

The experimental group participated in an 8‐week community‐

based programme combining exercise training and a plan to increase

PAL. Exercise training consisted of walking 5 days a week for

30–60 min (in cycles of 15–20 min) at speeds based on the last level

completed in a previously conducted incremental shuttle test

(Holland et al., 2014; Table 1). The plan to increase activity was based

on gradually raising the number of daily steps, inspired by the

“Theory of Establishment of Goals or Objectives” (Locke, Lathman, &

Smith, 1990). Each week, we aspired to increase the participants'

total number of steps by 10–20% in relation to the previous

week. Patients used pedometers to control walking speed and number

of daily steps; they were taught to note their gait and number of

steps/day in an activity diary, which was checked weekly through a

number of steps that each subject had to reach in each walking cycle is
detailed in the column on the right, where “n” is the number of steps taken
in 1‐min walking at the speed of the last level completed on the incremental shuttle test and “t” is the duration of each cycle Achieving this goal


phone call. Through these calls, we analysed possible causes of

noncompliance, encouraged patients, and set the new objectives for

the following week.

At the end of the programme, patients were instructed to main
tain the level of activity reached in the final week. Over the next

3 months, a monthly control was made through telephone calls,

although it was no longer mandatory to register activity.

The control group received informative sessions about the bene
fits of exercise. They were given the same pedometer as the subjects

in the experimental group, but no specific instructions, only general

recommendations to walk more every day.

### 2.4 | Analysis

A descriptive analysis was made of the socio‐demographical and

clinical characteristics of the subjects at the beginning of the study,

and homogeneity between groups was verified. Independent samples

_t tests and Mann–Whitney U tests were used to analyse the differ-_

ences between groups in the result variables postintervention and

after follow‐up versus preintervention. Moreover, a covariance anal
ysis was made. In the main variables, a sensitivity analysis was

applied, as well as an analysis of subgroups in order to determine

whether or not the use of long‐term oxygen therapy and the season

had any influence on the results. Finally, we determined the associa
tion between the modification in the PAL and the change in the rest

of the variables through the Spearman correlation coefficient,

checking for confounding factors. For the analysis of the normality

of the variables, we used the Shapiro–Wilk test. In all of the

analyses, we assumed a level of confidence (1 − _α) of 0.95 (level_

of significance α = 0.05). The program used was SPSS[®] Statistics

Version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago).

### 3 | RESULTS

A total of 40 subjects were recruited, of whom five dropped out and

two were excluded for noncompliance during the intervention phase

(17.5% loss). No losses occurred during the follow‐up period; there
fore, we analysed a total of 33 subjects (17 in the experimental group).

Figure 1 shows a participation diagram, and Table 2 lists the character
istics of the sample at the beginning of the study.

### 3.1 | Effects of the intervention

Postintervention, significant differences were found between

the groups in all of the main variables (p < 0.01; Table 3). In the

experimental group, EST increased by 6.1 ± 5.7 min and

491.4 ± 484.5 m (increases of 103% and 90%, respectively); steps/

day increased by 3,158 ± 2,191 or 45%; and total Baecke scores

increased by 1.7 ± 2.2. Furthermore, the experimental group showed

reduced total SGRQ scores, symptoms, and impact dimensions

(p < 0.01). No significant differences were observed on the dyspnoea

scale (p > 0.05).

During the follow‐up, significant differences between the groups


-----

compared with preintervention numbers, had increased by

6.9 ± 6.7 min and 592.6 ± 595.6 m (increases of 112% and 94%,

respectively); steps/day had increased by 3,525 ± 2,404 (49%); and

total Baecke scores increased by 3.3 ± 3.1. After 12 months, they

maintained improvements of 5.5 ± 6.3 min and 472 ± 576.6 m in

EST (95% and 81%), as well as of 1,797 ± 2,947 steps/day (25%)

and of 2 ± 2.6 in total Baecke score, compared with pre‐intervention

levels. Furthermore, total SGRQ scores, symptoms, and impact

dimensions continued to decrease over 3 months (p < 0.01), and this

was maintained in total score and impact dimension after 12 months

(p < 0.01). Nevertheless, no differences were observed in dyspnoea

(p > 0.05).

The number of exacerbations in the 12 months before the study

was similar in both groups (range 0–5) and decreased over the

12 months of monitoring in the experimental group (range 0–2),

although not significantly (p > 0.05).

Reporting Trials flow diagram of participation

### 3.1.1 | Analysis of sensitivity and subgroups

In the analysis of sensitivity, similar results were maintained to those

obtained in the protocol analysis. Moreover, when we separated the

groups according to whether or not they used long‐term oxygen ther
apy and the season that the patients completed the programmes

(autumn to winter or spring to summer), no differences were found

(p > 0.05).

### 3.2 | Associations between modification of PAL and exercise capacity, quality of life, dyspnoea, and exacerbations

In the association analysis controlled by confounding factors, a signif
icant correlation was found between increase in PAL and improved

EST results—as well as in quality of life—after both 3 and 12 months

### 4 | DISCUSSION

This study demonstrates that a community‐based PR programme in

COPD patients improves exercise capacity, PAL, and quality of life

over the medium and long term. Results were above the minimum


present scientific literature, there are relatively few studies of commu
nity‐based programmes, which primarily aim to increase PAL in COPD

patients and even fewer that combine self‐administered exercise

training with strategies of increased activity (Mantoani et al., 2016;

Watz et al., 2014). In this regard, our study covers a new terrain.

This research has also demonstrated that increased PAL

(measured in steps/day and Baecke score) directly affects the

increases in time and distance achieved on the EST and the reduction

of SGRQ scores. In contrast, there were no changes in dyspnoea

or exacerbations.

The benefits obtained in exercise capacity and quality of life indi
cate that this type of programme both produced a short‐term training

effect and maintained these benefits over time, suggesting that

patients autonomously adopted the regular practice of physical exer
cise. The programme was based on so‐called critical speed, which is

the maximum walking speed that can be maintained during a discrete

period of time and which corresponds to 90% of VO2max (Casas et al.,

2005). It is a simple and objective system that, employing a pedome
ter, allows people to control the intensity of their walking; conse
quently, it is easy to apply, which is a key factor in ensuring that

people stick to the programme in the long term. High‐speed walking

training based on the incremental shuttle test has been used success
fully in previous studies (Liu et al., 2008; Mitchell et al., 2014). More
over, the use of feedback systems—such as a musical programme,

which set the pace of the walk (Liu et al., 2008), monitoring heart rate

(Pradella et al., 2015) or the level of dyspnoea (de Sousa Pinto, Martín

Nogueras, Calvo Arenillas, & Ramos González, 2014)—also obtained

good results. In contrast, Dias et al. (2013) found no changes in

exercise capacity in a high‐speed walking plan with no specific speed

control, suggesting that participants may not have trained at the

established speed.

Our results regarding the number of steps/day and Baecke scores

clearly show changes in the activity habits of the experimental group.

These are consistent with results from other researchers who com
bined, as we did, a plan to increase activity with an exercise training

programme (Cruz, Brooks, & Marques, 2016; de Blok et al., 2006).

Nevertheless, other studies that applied programmes of increased

activity in an isolated manner reported less significant results in terms

of steps/day (Altenburg et al., 2015; Hospes, Bossenbroek, Ten

Hacken, van Hengel, & de Greef, 2009; Moy, Weston, Wilson, Hess,

& Richardson, 2012), which were not maintained over the long term

(Altenburg et al., 2015; Moy et al., 2016). This could be due to the

fact that reduced symptoms—associated with increased exercise

capacity—enable patients to initiate more activity on their own,

because fears that dyspnoea might arise are associated with fewer

steps/day (Danilack, Weston, Richardson, Mori, & Moy, 2014). This

reflection coincides with the conclusions of the recent reviews by

Mantoani et al. (2016) and Lahham et al. (2016), who recommend

the combination of physical training and behavioural intervention

strategies.

Furthermore, physical training through walking may also have

been useful in motivating patients to walk more. A recent study

found no differences in the number of steps after PR—based on

departure from our results could be explained by the different type


One factor that we consider to be essential to our results is the

type of instructions patients received about their exercise. These were

a set of general recommendations about walking may not be enough

to achieve measurable improvements in PAL, as we observed in the

control group of our study and in others' research (de Blok et al.,

2006; Hospes et al., 2009). On the other hand, Mendoza et al.

(2015) did find a significant increase in activity (3,000 steps/day) when

conducting a 3‐month programme in which the only difference

between the groups was that participants in the experimental group

received pedometers and made a note of their daily steps. Neverthe
less, the sample analysed in this study showed little ventilatory affec
tation, and the maintenance of effects in the longer term was not

assessed. In any case, more research is needed to determine the influ
ence of the accuracy of the instructions given to patients in commu
nity‐based PR programmes.

Moreover, the absence of changes in the perception of dyspnoea in

our study does not coincide with what has been reported in other stud
ies that analysed community‐based PR through walking (de Sousa Pinto

et al., 2014; Mitchell et al., 2014). These discrepancies may be due to

our choice of dyspnoea scale; the Medical Research Council scale is

very simple and depends on activity level (Alonso, 2014). The absence

of change in the number of exacerbations after 12 months is consistent

with results reported by other authors (van Wetering, Hoogendoorn,

strategies to manage the disease and the early detection of flare‐ups,

an effect that could be also be attributed to our results.

Therefore, we conclude that the increase in the PAL in our study had

an influence on the changes in exercise capacity and quality of life, accord
ing with a recent review (Meshe, Claydon, Bungay, & Andrew, 2017). The

good results obtained from this intervention seem to magnify this associ
ation in relation to other research (Altenburg et al., 2015; Zwerink, van der

Palen, van der Valk, Brusse‐Keizer, & Effing, 2013). Nevertheless, we have

not found any association with exacerbations, which could have been

influenced by the sample size or the period of monitoring, because the

studies that reported a significant correlation between the modification

in the PAL and the exacerbation used larger samples and more prolonged

monitoring periods (Durheim et al., 2015; Esteban et al., 2014).

### 4.1 | Limitations of the study

The scale used to assess dyspnoea may not have been adequately dis
criminating to show changes. Furthermore, the relatively small sample

size and year‐long monitoring period may have been insufficient to

reveal differences in the number of exacerbations. In addition, the

demographic differences between the study sample and other popula
tions could cause a drop in the observed results. Finally, the evaluation

of the patient's barriers to exercise would have contributed relevant

information to the study.

### 5 | CONCLUSIONS

A community‐based 8‐week training programme to increase PAL

—based on high‐speed walking and using a pedometer for feedback

—effectively improves exercise capacity, PAL, and quality of life in

COPD patients, and these results are partially maintained for

12 months. Further studies have to explore whether or not these

behavioural changes are sustained for more than 12 months and what

kind of supervision stimulus could ensure the maintenance.

The change in PAL was significantly correlated with improve
ments in exercise capacity and quality of life. In order to determine

any possible variations in exacerbations, it would be necessary to con
duct further studies with more prolonged monitoring periods.

### 6 | PHYSIOTHERAPY IMPLICATIONS


patients for physical activity, as we have showed with our pro
gramme. This protocol of exercise training and behavioural change

is easily applicable to clinical practice, with a low cost. The following

could be interesting: (a) its development in private clinics and

primary care centres, as alternative in those patients who cannot

access to a rehabilitation centre; (b) the maintenance of the effects

after PR; and (c) to promote the practice of exercise and increase

the PAL in the patients (in combination with the classic programmes

or after them).

Moreover, our results impel us to continue researching in other

effective interventions to make PR more available for COPD patients

and their applicability in the most severe patients, in comparison with

classic PR programmes. In the same way, it would be necessary to

know more about the factors that influence the adherence of patients

to exercise.
