### ABSTRACT


Background and objective: In patients with COPD, this
study evaluated the effect on health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) of adding ongoing feedback to a 12-month
unsupervised maintenance walking programme.
Methods: Participants were randomized to either an
intervention group (IG) or control group (CG). Both
groups completed the same 2-month supervised, walking training programme followed by a 12-month unsupervised maintenance walking programme. During the
maintenance programme, the IG received ongoing feedback (telephone calls, biofeedback and progressive goal
setting) and the CG received no feedback.
Results: A total of 75 participants completed the study
(mean (SD): age 69 (8) years; forced expiratory volume
in 1 s (FEV1) 43 (15) % predicted). There was no
between-group differences in the magnitude of change
in HRQoL when data collected on completion of the 12month maintenance programme were compared with
that collected either before the 2-month supervised programme (mean between-group difference (MD) in total
St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire change scores:
1 point, 95% CI: −9 to 7) or on completion of the 2month supervised programme (MD: 4 points, 95% CI −2
to 10).
Conclusion: Following a 2-month supervised walking
training programme, ongoing feedback was no more
effective than no feedback in maintaining HRQoL during a 12-month unsupervised walking programme.

### INTRODUCTION

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is significantly reduced compared with healthy individuals[1] and
better HRQoL has been related to reduced hospital admissions.[2] Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has been shown to


-----

improve HRQoL[3] as well as improve exercise capacity and
reduce hospital admissions in patients with COPD.[4][–][6] Following completion of short-term (6–12 weeks) PR programmes, the positive effects on HRQoL and exercise
capacity[3] have been shown to decline within 1–2 years.[7][–][9]
Maintenance exercise programmes aim to encourage
long-term adherence to exercise in order to preserve the
benefits achieved during short-term programmes. While a
recent systematic review concluded that maintenance programmes with supervised exercise sessions, conducted at
least once per week can maintain exercise capacity for up
to 6 months in patients with COPD,[10] many PR programmes lack the capacity to offer long-term supervised
maintenance exercise programmes.[11][–][13]
Randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating
unsupervised maintenance programmes have shown
little effect on maintaining HRQoL and exercise capacity, despite using strategies to encourage adherence
such as telephone support with or without monthly
supervised exercise sessions.[7,14,15] When biofeedback
strategies have been added to telephone support,
maintenance of effects has been shown.[16,17] However,
these previous findings should be interpreted with caution due to limitations arising from very small sample
size[17] and short durations of follow-up.[16,17] As such, the
effectiveness of telephone support combined with biofeedback to maintain HRQoL and exercise capacity during an unsupervised maintenance walking programme
over a longer time period remains unknown.
The primary aim of this study was to evaluate, in
patients with COPD, the effect on HRQoL of adding
ongoing feedback (telephone calls, biofeedback via
pedometer and progressive goal setting) compared
with no feedback during a 12-month unsupervised
maintenance walking programme, which followed a
supervised walking training programme. The hypothesis was that, at study completion, participants who
received the ongoing feedback would have better
HRQoL compared with those who did not receive the
ongoing feedback. The secondary aim of the study was
to evaluate the effects of the ongoing feedback on exercise capacity and adherence to the maintenance walking programme.

### METHODS

The study was a long-term, prospective, assessorblinded, multicentre (five sites), RCT with concealed
allocation. Participants were randomized prior to commencing a 2-month supervised walking training programme (i.e. baseline) via an independent telephone
randomization service using computerized random
number generator sequencing into two groups: an
intervention group (IG) and a control group (CG).
Before commencing the 12-month maintenance programme, both groups received the same 2-month intervention of a supervised, walking training programme,
two to three times per week. The findings of the 2month study have been previously reported, comparing
the effects of supervised walking training (combined IG
and CG) to a group who received usual medical care
and did not participate in any exercise training.[18] The
intervention for participants in the IG and CG only


differed once they entered the 12-month maintenance
phase. Randomization was stratified according to lung
function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) < or
≥40% predicted), HRQoL measures using the St
George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (total score
< or ≥45), exercise capacity (6-min walk distance
(6MWD) < or ≥70% predicted) and trial centre.
Participants were recruited from outpatient PR programmes in two cities within Australia between May
2009 and June 2012. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
have been previously described.[18] Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants. The study
was approved by the ethics committees of Sydney
South West Area Health Service (Sydney, Australia),
The University of Sydney (Sydney, Australia), Curtin
University (Perth, Australia), Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital (Nedlands, Australia) and Bentley Hospital (Perth,
Australia).
Following completion of the short-term supervised
programme, both the IG and CG were instructed to
perform unsupervised maintenance walking exercise,
3 days a week for 12 months starting at the same duration achieved in the final week of supervised training
and at a pace which elicited a dyspnoea score of three
to four on a modified 0–10 point category-ratio dyspnoea scale.[19] In addition, the IG received telephone
calls, biofeedback provided via a pedometer (G-Sensor
accelerometer, Pedometers Australia, Cannington,
Australia) and progressive goal setting (based on
pedometer data). Diaries were provided for participants
in both groups to record details of completed walking
sessions. Further details of the intervention and the telephone script can be found in Appendices S1 and S2
(Supplementary Information).

Assessment protocol and measurements
Participants were assessed on four occasions over a 14month period as follows: (i) prior to commencing the
2-month supervised walking training programme
(baseline assessment), (ii) at the end of the 2-month
supervised walking training programme which marked
the commencement of the maintenance phase (2month assessment), (iii) after 6 months of maintenance
(8-month assessment) and (iv) after 12 months of
maintenance (14-month assessment). During the baseline assessment, age, height, weight, gender, co-morbid
conditions and medication use were recorded. Levels
of anxiety and depression were measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).[20] At all four
assessment time points, participants completed measures of HRQoL, exercise capacity and spirometric lung
function over two visits within a 7-day period. FEV1
and forced vital capacity (FVC) were collected using a
calibrated portable spirometer (EasyOne spirometer,
ndd Medical Technologies Inc., Andover, MA, USA)
according to standard procedures. Lung volumes (body
plethysmography) and single-breath diffusing capacity
of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were measured at baseline only, according to standard protocols.
Measures obtained were compared with normative
data.[21][–][23] Disease severity was classified according to
the Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management,
and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
(GOLD) spirometric criteria.[24]


-----

Health-related quality of life
The primary outcome was HRQoL measured by the
SGRQ.[25] The interviewer-administered Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ), with the individualized dyspnoea domain, was also completed.[26]

Exercise capacity
Functional exercise capacity was measured by the 6min walk test (6MWT), peak exercise capacity by the
incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) and endurance
exercise capacity by the endurance shuttle walk test
(ESWT).[27] Procedures for the walk tests have been previously described.[18]

Adherence to unsupervised maintenance
walking programme
Adherence in both groups was determined using data
from diaries and also, for the IG, by reviewing telephone transcripts. At the 8-month and 14-month
assessments, the number of returned diaries in both
groups was recorded, as well as the number of completed telephone transcripts in the IG.


Sample size and data analysis
The sample size was based on detection of a clinical
meaningful difference in total SGRQ score between the
IG and CG at the 14-month assessment. Eighty-six participants were sufficient to provide 80% power to detect
a between-group difference in SGRQ total score of at
least 7.7 points, which is greater than the minimum
clinically important difference (α = 0.05, two-sided).[28]
This assumed an SD of 12.7 points in total SGRQ score
as previously reported.[29] To allow for a 10% dropout,
95 participants were required. Data were analysed
using SPSS software (Version 20 for Windows, IBM Inc,
Armonk, NY, USA). Intention to treat analysis was conducted with no imputation of missing data. Descriptive
statistics are presented as raw mean values and SD
unless otherwise stated. Linear mixed models (LMM)
were used to determine significance between groups
across all time points using the sample that was available at each time point. An estimate of the within-group
effect on three comparisons, baseline to 2 months;
baseline to 14 months; and 2 to 14 months, was determined for each group using the least significant difference (pairwise comparison) and is reported as mean
differences and 95% CI from the predicted values of
the LMM. To evaluate the between-group treatment

effect on these three comparisons, change scores were
determined by simple subtraction of the within-group
effect and differences in the change scores were compared using independent t-tests.

### RESULTS

Participant flow is presented in Figure 1. Baseline characteristics of participants were similar between groups
(Table 1). Participants had moderate to severe COPD
(FEV1: 45 (15) % predicted),[24] reduced HRQoL (SGRQ
total score: 46 (17)), reduced exercise capacity (6MWD:
74 (13) % predicted) and symptoms of anxiety and
depression that were within normal range (0–7 points on
HADS[20]). Participants completed an average of 17 (7) out
of a possible 24 supervised walking training sessions prior
to commencement of the maintenance programme. Of
the 95 participants who commenced the 2-month supervised walking training programme, 20 participants (21%)
did not complete any of the 14-month outcome measures.
No adverse events were reported during the study.

Health-related quality of life
The SGRQ outcomes are presented in Tables 2–4 and
Figure 2A. Both the IG and CG significantly improved
SGRQ total score at the end of the 2-month supervised
walking training programme. Between-group analyses
demonstrated no significant differences in the change
in SGRQ from baseline to 14 months or from 2 to
14 months (Fig. 2A). The results from the CRQ are presented in Tables S1–S3 (Supplementary Information).

Exercise capacity
The exercise capacity outcomes are presented in
Tables 2–4 and Figure 2B. Both the IG and CG significantly improved exercise capacity measured by the ESWT
with the IG also significantly improving on the ISWT and
6MWT at the end of the 2-month supervised walking programme. Between-group analyses demonstrated no significant differences in change in exercise capacity from
baseline to 14 months or from 2 to 14 months.

Adherence to unsupervised maintenance
walking programme
Reported levels of adherence to unsupervised maintenance walking exercise sessions are presented in
Table S4 (Supplementary Information). Between-group
analyses of adherence levels were not possible due to
lack of data in the CG.

### DISCUSSION

This large, multicentre, RCT was designed to determine
the effects on HRQoL of adding ongoing feedback to a
12-month unsupervised maintenance walking programme that followed a 2-month, supervised, walking
training programme in patients with COPD. Although
the supervised programme produced significant
improvements in HRQoL in both groups, when all
assessment time points were considered, there were no

no difference between groups in the SGRQ during a
12-month unsupervised maintenance exercise programme despite the IG receiving monthly supervised
sessions.[7] However, some evidence of the effectiveness
of the ongoing feedback in the IG was demonstrated by
SGRQ total score being maintained from 2 to
14 months and remaining significantly better than
baseline in the IG by the end of the study. In contrast,
in the CG, there was a significant decline in SGRQ total
score from 2 to 14 months and this had returned to
baseline levels by the end of the study.
The ESWT is an outcome which represents endurance walking capacity and is particularly sensitive to
the effects of short-term training in COPD.[27] Both
groups had significant improvements in ESWT time following the short-term training. In the IG, there was a
non-significant decline in ESWT time from 2 to
14 months which remained significantly better at
14 months compared with baseline. In contrast, the CG


had a significant decline in ESWT time from 2 to
14 months and this had returned to baseline levels by
the end of the study, demonstrating no maintenance of
endurance walking capacity in this group. There were,
however, no between-group differences in ESWT time
when changes from baseline to 14 months or 2 to
14 months were compared. This finding is in contrast
to previous RCTs or studies that demonstrated maintenance of functional exercise capacity during unsupervised maintenance walking programmes that
investigated a similar combination of telephone support with biofeedback.[16,17] However, these previous
studies were limited by lack of blinded assessment,[16]
small sample size[17] and short follow-up periods of 3[16]
and 6[17] months. In addition, participants in these previous studies[16,17] were randomized following completion
of short-term PR whereas in our study, randomization
occurred at commencement of the supervised walking
training. Participants who complete PR may be more

compliant with exercise and be more motivated to participate in long-term exercise training, which could
have contributed to the positive effects on exercise
capacity.[16,17] We chose to randomize participants prior
to commencing a short-term PR programme as this is
more representative of the patient population and
patient journey.
While HRQoL and ESWT were maintained in the IG,
this did not translate into between-group differences
which may have been a consequence of a number of
factors, in particular, that the changes were small in
relation to the variability in measurements. The small
effect of the intervention may have resulted from the
relatively poor adherence to the unsupervised walking
programme, which was somewhat surprising as we
hypothesized that the regular feedback and ongoing
support using health coaching principles[30] would have
resulted in improved adherence during the maintenance phase. It appears from our findings that this
level of support was not sufficient or appropriately targeted to change exercise behaviour and encourage
adherence in patients with COPD in order to maintain
a significantly greater HRQoL and exercise capacity
than those not receiving such interventions. Adherence
remains difficult to objectively measure and hence selfreported diaries are often used; however, our results
demonstrated limited engagement in the use of diaries.
While adherence levels in the CG appeared to be
higher than in the IG, this only reflected the low number of diaries returned in the CG rather than greater
adherence. A greater amount of data was available on
the level of adherence in the IG due to information collected during the regular telephone calls. The IG

adherence of 52% to the prescribed walking exercise
frequency during the maintenance phase was similar to
that reported in other studies[7,31,32] and may be a more
accurate reflection of adherence levels in patients with
COPD than that collected via diaries. A further explanation for the lack of between-group difference may be
that both groups were instructed to do walking exercise
during the maintenance programme, thus potentially
reducing the between-group differences. This contrasts
with a previous maintenance study[17] in which the comparison group did not do maintenance exercise and the
use of telephone calls and pedometers was effective at
producing between-group differences in HRQoL at
6 months following completion of the initial training
programme, mainly due to a decline in HRQoL in
the CG.[17]
A limitation of the study was the relatively large loss
to follow-up (21%) during the maintenance phase
which meant that the target of 86 participants completing the study was not reached. This dropout rate is
consistent with other maintenance studies in
COPD.[7,15,17,33] A larger sample size would have been
unlikely to change the between-group differences as
the P-values were not close to being significant and the
magnitude of the differences were less than the minimum clinically important differences so unlikely to be
important. A second limitation of the study was that a


-----

per-protocol analysis was not possible as there were
insufficient data to determine accurate adherence to
the maintenance walking programme, due to the
inadequacies of diary use. In future studies, more
objective measures of adherence would help inform
clinicians about the true effect of unsupervised maintenance interventions in adherent participants. Despite
these limitations, the strength of this study was the
robust methodological design using intention-to-treat
analysis with participants recruited prior to short-term
supervised exercise training, thus reflecting real-life
clinical practice.
In conclusion, this study investigated the effects on
HRQoL of adding ongoing feedback to a 12-month
unsupervised maintenance walking programme that
followed a 2-month supervised walking training programme in patients with COPD. There were no
between-group differences in the magnitude of change
in HRQoL from baseline to 14 months or from 2 to
14 months. Based on these findings, ongoing feedback
was no more effective than no feedback in maintaining
the gains of short-term supervised walking programme.
As long-term supervised maintenance exercise programmes are not always an option following PR, further research is needed to investigate the optimal
design of unsupervised maintenance programmes in
patients with COPD.
