ABSTRACT There is a need to increase and maintain physical activity in patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We assessed 12-month efficacy and effectiveness of the Urban
Training intervention on physical activity in COPD patients.
This randomised controlled trial (NCT01897298) allocated 407 COPD patients from primary and
hospital settings 1:1 to usual care (n=205) or Urban Training (n=202). Urban Training consisted of a
baseline motivational interview, advice to walk on urban trails designed for COPD patients in outdoor
public spaces and other optional components for feedback, motivation, information and support
(pedometer, calendar, physical activity brochure, website, phone text messages, walking groups and a
phone number). The primary outcome was 12-month change in steps·day[−][1] measured by accelerometer.
Efficacy analysis (with per-protocol analysis set, n=233 classified as adherent to the assigned
intervention) showed adjusted (95% CI) 12-month difference +957 (184–1731) steps·day[−][1] between Urban
Training and usual care. Effectiveness analysis (with intention-to-treat analysis set, n=280 patients
completing the study at 12 months including unwilling and self-reported non-adherent patients) showed
no differences between groups. Leg muscle pain during walks was more frequently reported in Urban
Training than usual care, without differences in any of the other adverse events.
Urban Training, combining behavioural strategies with unsupervised outdoor walking, was efficacious in
increasing physical activity after 12 months in COPD patients, with few safety concerns. However, it was
ineffective in the full population including unwilling and self-reported non-adherent patients.

#### Introduction
Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are substantially less active than their healthy
peers [1] and this inactivity has been consistently related to a worse prognosis of the disease [2]. Thus,
helping patients to adopt a more active lifestyle is a major goal in COPD management. Unfortunately, how
to produce and maintain such behavioural change remains a challenge [3, 4].

Based on the beneficial effects of behavioural strategies on changing physical activity in patients with
chronic diseases [5], recent COPD studies have focused on these kinds of interventions. Some of them,
including physical activity counselling, pedometers or telecoaching (by computer or mobile technology)
have reported increases in physical activity in the short term (⩽4 months) [6–8]. However, few studies
followed patients for ⩾1 year [6, 9–11] and only one of them showed a sustained increase in physical
activity, which was limited to a subset of patients [9]. Thus, one of the main difficulties of interventions to
modify physical activity in COPD patients the achievement of a more prolonged long-term effect.

Given that currently available interventions are based mostly on patients’ individual factors (biological and
psychological), we argue that customising the interventions to patients’ interpersonal (social support and
cultural practices) and environmental (social, built and natural) determinants of physical activity [12]
could help to maintain the increase in physical activity in the long term. Indeed, a report from the World
Health Organization [13] suggests that interventions adapted to the local context and/or using existing
social support and community structures are the most successful. In COPD, patients who live with others,
walk the dog, take care of grandchildren or have an active partner have higher physical activity levels than
those who do not, regardless of COPD severity and other individual characteristics [14–16], which
suggests that interpersonal and environmental factors are key factors to include in future interventions.

Based on these premises we designed an intervention (Urban Training) consisting of motivational
interviews, availability of outdoor walking trails specifically designed for exercise training of COPD
patients [17] and other support components. We hypothesised that Urban Training could encourage
COPD patients to increase and maintain their walking activity in the long term, because walking in public
spaces is an extended cultural practice well integrated into the daily lifestyle of our COPD patients (elderly
inhabitants of Mediterranean cities) [18].

We assessed the efficacy and effectiveness of the Urban Training intervention on physical activity level
after 12 months of follow-up in patients with COPD. Secondary outcomes included severe COPD
exacerbations, functional exercise capacity, body composition, health-related quality of life, anxiety and
depression.

#### Methods
Study patients
[Details on patient recruitment, randomisation and blinding are provided in online supplementary table S1.](http://erj.ersjournals.com/lookup/doi/10.1183/13993003.00063-2018.figures-only#fig-data-supplementary-materials)
Briefly, we selected all subjects with a diagnosis of COPD according to the American Thoracic Society/
European Respiratory Society recommendations (post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s
(FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio <0.70) [19] who were seen in any of the participating 33
primary care and five hospital health centres from five Catalan seaside municipalities. We excluded
patients with severe or life-threatening comorbidities, or those clinically unstable. The ethics committees of

all participating institutions approved the study, along with the request for complete information
exemption from patients, and all participants provided written informed consent.

Study design and interventions
This is a prospective, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial registered at clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT01897298) and reported according to the 2010 CONSORT statement [20] and its extension for
non-pharmacological interventions [21]. Patients were allocated 1:1 to the Urban Training intervention or
usual-care groups using random block sizes of six, eight and 10. The study consisted of four visits (figure 1):
enrolment and baseline data collection; additional baseline data collection, randomisation and intervention
1 week later; 12-month data collection; and additional 12-month data collection 1 week thereafter.

Both groups received the usual standardised pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological treatment for
COPD, including pulmonary rehabilitation, at the discretion of their physician and without any
intervention by the research team.

Patients in the usual-care group were provided with general health counselling and the European Lung
Foundation (ELF) information brochure “Living an active life with COPD” [22], which recommends
⩾30 min moderate physical activity ⩾5 days per week.

The Urban Training intervention consisted of the following six components (figure 2), detailed in the
[online supplementary material. 1) At baseline, a respiratory physiotherapist adequately trained in](http://erj.ersjournals.com/lookup/doi/10.1183/13993003.00063-2018.figures-only#fig-data-supplementary-materials)
behavioural strategies used motivational interviewing techniques [23], integrated with a stage-matched
approach [24], for a maximum of 1 h. The interview was centred on empathy, reflective listening and
affirmation, and addressed patients’ resistance (personal difficulties, barriers and limitations) to eliciting
behavioural change. Information on the remaining components of the intervention was provided during
this interview. During the follow-up period, the physiotherapist administered up to four phone calls lasting
5–10 min to maintain motivation, depending on patients’ self-efficacy and stage of change. 2) Participants
received a dossier containing various maps of Urban Training walking trails, previously validated [17],
according to their mobility options and preferences. Concisely, trails of different intensities (low, moderate
or high, combining urban elements of varying intensity (stairs, ramps and types of surfacing)) were

available in several walkable public spaces (boulevards, beaches and parks) of the five municipalities. The
physiotherapist provided a complete explanation of trails characteristics and instructed patients to train
following the FITT (frequency, intensity, time and type) principle [25]. Each patient was advised to start
with a trail of intensity appropriate to his/her baseline dyspnoea and 6-min walking distance (6MWD),
and instructed how to increase progressively the volume (number of walks per day on the same trail) and/
or the intensity of the trails during the following 12 months according to their symptoms and motivation
[(online supplementary figure S1). In all cases, the instructions were to walk at least one trail per day](http://erj.ersjournals.com/lookup/doi/10.1183/13993003.00063-2018.figures-only#fig-data-supplementary-materials)
⩾5 days per week, at a pace reaching a dyspnoea Borg scale score of 4–6 [26]. 3) Patients were provided
with both a pedometer and a personalised calendar to monitor their physical activity and maintain
motivation. 4) Patients received the same ELF information brochure as the usual-care group and the link
[to the project website (www.entrenament-urba.cat/). They were requested to provide a personal cell phone](http://www.entrenament-urba.cat/)
number where they would receive phone text messages every 2 weeks with educational or motivational
messages. 5) Once per month during the follow-up period, patients could join a walking group for walking
a trail accompanied by an experienced physical activity trainer. 6) Patients were given a phone number to
contact the physiotherapists for any questions during follow-up. Of note, the Urban Training intervention
was proposed as a supplement to the physical activities of daily life and in no case as a substitute activity.


Procedures
[Full details and references on study procedures and quality control are available in the online](http://erj.ersjournals.com/lookup/doi/10.1183/13993003.00063-2018.figures-only#fig-data-supplementary-materials)

(interviewer-administered questionnaire); 2) 6-min walk test; 3) weight, height, body mass index (BMI)
and fat-free mass index (FFMI) (physical examination and bioelectrical impedance); 4) FEV1 and FVC
(pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry); 5) comorbidities, pharmacological therapy and the number
and severity of COPD exacerbations in the previous 12 months; 6) physical activity (Dynaport
accelerometer; McRoberts BV, The Hague, The Netherlands), previously validated for COPD [27, 28]. A
valid physical activity measurement was defined as ⩾3 days with ⩾8 h of wearing time within waking
hours [29]; compliance with the accelerometer was excellent (at baseline all patients fulfilled this criterion,
median (range) wear was 7 (3–7) days, and recording time was 14.9 (11.1–15.0) h, of 15 h maximum from
07:00 h to 22:00 h); at the final visit six (2%) out of 286 patients did not fulfil the criterion of wearing
time per day and, consequently, were excluded; among included patients, median (range) wear was 7 (4–7)
days and recording time was 14.8 (10.2–15) h; all patients included at least one weekend day both at
baseline and final visit); and 7) physical activity experience (Clinical-PROactive Physical Activity
(C-PPAC)). Additionally, at 12 months, patients answered a questionnaire about satisfaction with the study
components and any potential adverse events experienced during or after walks in the previous 12 months.
Finally, the physiotherapists administering both interventions noted down patients’ spontaneous report of
unwillingness to follow the instructions (e.g. walking ⩾5 days per week ⩾30 min·day[−][1] in the usual-care
group or walking the Urban Training trails in the Urban Training group) at the baseline visit, as well as
spontaneous reports of non-adherence (i.e. not having followed the instructions) at the 12-month visit.

Study outcomes
The primary outcome was the change in number of steps per day from baseline to 12-month follow-up.
Secondary outcomes were having any severe COPD exacerbation (leading to hospital or emergency-room
admission) during the 12-month follow-up and the 12-month changes in 6MWD, BMI, FFMI, CAT and
CCQ total scores, and HAD-anxiety and -depression scores. Exploratory outcomes were the 12-month
changes in phototest score, and total, amount and difficulty C-PPAC scores.

Statistical analysis
To detect a difference of 775 steps·day[−][1] (primary outcome) between groups (based on previous research
about the effects of behavioural interventions in the elderly) [30], with a two-sided α=0.05 and a power of
80%, assuming a standard deviation of 3000 steps·day[−][1] and a correlation between baseline and final steps
⩾0.7 (based on authors’ data in COPD patients), a sample size of 142 patients per group was necessary. To
account for a 30% dropout rate during follow-up, we planned to recruit 202 participants per group (404 in
total).

Prespecified efficacy and effectiveness were analysed using per-protocol and intention-to-treat (ITT)
analysis sets, respectively. Briefly, ITT was defined as all randomised patients who completed the study at
12 months and provided a valid record of physical activity, while per-protocol was the subset of ITT who
were classified as adherent to their corresponding intervention. Adherence was obtained from the
interviews. We classified as “non-adherent” patients who 1) spontaneously reported at baseline that they
were unwilling to follow any of the instructions; or 2) spontaneously reported at the 12-month visit that
they had not been adherent to the study protocol (see the Procedures section). Remaining patients were
labelled as “adherent”. To test effectiveness, we built linear or logistic regression models, using the change
from baseline to 12-month follow-up as the outcome, the intervention group as the main exposure
variable and baseline levels of the corresponding outcome as a covariate (to account for individual
differences in baseline levels). In efficacy analysis, we adjusted additionally for the variables related to
adherence, since previous literature has shown that this adjustment may reduce the selection bias produced
by a differential distribution of the reasons that moved participants to be adherent [31].

Post hoc analyses included stratification of efficacy results according to subgroups defined by baseline
[patient characteristics (online supplementary material). All analyses were redone using repeated measures](http://erj.ersjournals.com/lookup/doi/10.1183/13993003.00063-2018.figures-only#fig-data-supplementary-materials)
ANOVA instead of linear regression. Safety analysis set included patients answering the adverse events
questions at 12 months. All analyses were conducted with Stata 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX,
USA).

#### Results
Between 30 October 2013 and 29 January 2016, 552 stable COPD patients were assessed for eligibility and
[407 patients underwent randomisation and received the corresponding intervention (figure 3, online](http://erj.ersjournals.com/lookup/doi/10.1183/13993003.00063-2018.figures-only#fig-data-supplementary-materials)

corresponding intervention and accordingly constituted the per-protocol analysis set. Patients who
spontaneously reported unwillingness or non-adherence to the corresponding intervention had lower
FEV1/FVC ratio, were most often current smokers, had diabetes in a higher proportion and showed higher
[values in the HAD-depression score than the rest of the patients (online supplementary table S5).](http://erj.ersjournals.com/lookup/doi/10.1183/13993003.00063-2018.figures-only#fig-data-supplementary-materials)

Baseline characteristics were similar in the per-protocol and ITT analysis sets and between two
intervention groups (tables 1–3). Patients in the per-protocol analysis set were mostly male (88%), mean
±SD age 69±8 years, had mild-to-very severe COPD (FEV1 58±17% predicted), preserved functional
exercise capacity (6MWD 505±81 m) and walked a mean±SD 8039±3964 steps·day[−][1].

After 12 months, according to the per-protocol analysis set (efficacy analysis), patients in the usual-care
group had not changed their physical activity, whereas those in the Urban Training group increased it by
816 steps·day[−][1] (figure 4 and table 2). In the analysis adjusted by factors independently related to
[adherence (FEV1/FVC ratio, smoking, diabetes and HAD-depression score; online supplementary table S6)](http://erj.ersjournals.com/lookup/doi/10.1183/13993003.00063-2018.figures-only#fig-data-supplementary-materials)
and steps at baseline, the adjusted difference in steps between the Urban Training and usual-care groups
was 957 (95% CI 184–1731) steps·day[−][1] (figure 4 and table 2). There were no differences between
intervention groups in any of the secondary outcomes or in cognitive impairment (exploratory outcome)
(table 2). Positive changes (statistically significant better values) of physical activity experience were
observed in the intervention group for the total, amount and difficulty scores. Stratification of efficacy
results showed no significant differences between groups (figure 5). The adjusted difference at 12 months
was 959 (−72–1989) steps·day[−][1] for patients with mild-to-moderate COPD and 383 (−860–1626)
steps·day[−][1] for patients with severe-to-very severe COPD. Patients with higher physical activity levels at

remaining adverse events (table 4).

Of the 132 patients of the intervention group participating in the follow-up visit, 70%, 87% and 90% used
the trails maps, calendars and pedometers, respectively; 31% participated at least once in the walking

This randomised controlled trial showed that the Urban Training intervention is more efficacious than
usual care in increasing physical activity after 12 months in patients with COPD, with few safety concerns.

However, the intervention was not effective according to results with the ITT analysis set, suggesting that
it improves physical activity only in willing, adherent patients. No effect of the intervention was found on
severe COPD exacerbations, functional exercise capacity, body composition, health-related quality of life,
anxiety or depression, in either analysis approach.

The main finding of this study is that the Urban Training intervention increased physical activity in
COPD patients 1) at long-term (after 12 months) and 2) in a large scale of magnitude. Most studies
testing the effects of behavioural physical activity interventions in COPD patients have successfully
resulted in positive effects only at short-term (≈3 months) [6, 7], and only one reported a long-term
increase, which was restricted to a post hoc subgroup analysis [9]. Examination of the content of previous
and current successful physical activity interventions allows us to hypothesise that the combination of
motivational interviews, pedometers and diaries/calendars may be key for the long-term effect. The
≈900 steps·day[−][1] increase observed in the Urban Training group lies within the defined limits of the
minimal important difference in COPD patients (between 600 and 1100 steps·day[−][1]) [32] and is greater
than the 255 steps·day[−][1] change observed in the long-term physical activity COPD trial referred to above
and the mean 808 steps·day[−][1] change identified in a review of pedometer-based physical activity
interventions in older adults (including follow-ups between 2 weeks and 23 months) [30]. Our contention
is that customising walking trails to patients’ individual (e.g. exercise capacity and motivation),
interpersonal (e.g. social support and cultural habit of walking) and environmental factors (e.g. lack of
steep stairs in walking trails and home proximity or bus access to them) may have contributed to the
long-term duration and large magnitude of the intervention effect. Therefore, Urban Training appears to
be an attractive intervention potentially feasible due to its simplicity and reduced burden.

Potential harms of the Urban Training intervention need to be discussed. First, patients in the Urban
Training group reported lower-extremity muscle pain in a higher proportion than patients in the

usual-care group, without differences in lower-extremity joint pain or other adverse events. This could be
attributed to the fact that the Urban Training walking trails included ramps and stairs that may promote
eccentric work of the leg muscles, which may result in muscle but not joint pain [33]. Second, although a
recent trial has reported an acute increase in respiratory symptoms after walking in urban polluted areas [34],
we did not collect information on these potential adverse events because 1) most of the trails were located in
green or blue areas and 2) residential air pollution exposure was comparable between groups by design.
Finally, the fact that patients included in the ITT but not in the per-protocol analysis set experienced greater
decline in physical activity than those in the per-protocol analysis set could suggest that the intervention was
harmful for them (which could have made them non-adherent). However, this is not supported by the fact
that they experienced the same frequency of adverse events during or after walks as the rest of the Urban
Training group and that a natural decline of physical activity levels has been observed previously in the
absence of interventions [35, 36].

The Urban Training intervention did not improve most of the secondary and exploratory outcomes. The
lack of effect on functional exercise capacity was unexpected, since, based on the physiological response
generated when walking the trails during the validation study [17], we hypothesised that the intervention
could produce effects similar to those of typical exercise training interventions. However, the lack of daily
supervision when walking the trails may have hindered patients from regularly achieve a minimum
training intensity (e.g. walking at a pace that generates dyspnoea or fatigue scores between 4 and 6 in the
Borg scale). Indeed, a previous intervention that increased both physical activity and functional exercise
capacity after 3 months had included close patient supervision via telecoaching [8]. The remaining
secondary outcomes (severe COPD exacerbations, body composition, quality of life, anxiety or depression)
were not primarily targeted by any of the Urban Training components and their improvement was
expected only as a result of the expected increase in physical activity. Based on our results, it is tempting
to speculate that the improvement in physical activity levels would need to be sustained for a period
>12 months in order to result in measurable changes in the other health outcomes. Another explanation is

that our patients already had a relatively good health status as per their values in COPD admissions,
quality of life, anxiety or depression; therefore, they had little room for improvement. Finally, the Urban
Training intervention improved patients’ experience of their physical activity (exploratory outcome), in both
the amount and difficulty dimensions, which supports that this concept provides complementary information
to other related constructs such as health-related quality of life or exercise-induced symptoms [37].

The findings of this study are encouraging for COPD research and its management as well as for physical
activity promotion in other populations. First, our findings highlight the consideration of patients’
interpersonal (social and cultural) factors and environment when designing further interventions. From
the clinical viewpoint, this approach may appear more feasible than others based strongly on technology
solutions, particularly in countries with limited healthcare budgets. Second, our study supports the
involvement of behaviour specialists in the design and administration of physical activity interventions or
an equivalent acquisition of knowledge on behavioural techniques by health professionals who generally

exhibit a lack of training in behavioural change techniques [38, 39]. Finally, at the city level, interventions
such as the Urban Training may contribute towards amortising the investment in public space (otherwise
underused during certain times of the day) thus improving its sustainability. In fact, a close collaboration
between health professionals and local governments has been promoted for example in the World Health
Organization Healthy Cities project and is likely to result in social, economic and health benefits for all [40].

A limitation of the current study is that we defined adherence, and consequently the per-protocol analysis
set, according to patient report. It is of note that we defined “non-adherence” from patient report and
“adherence” otherwise. Thus, the ITT analysis set included, in the first place, patients who at baseline
spontaneously reported unwillingness to undergo the intervention they had been assigned to. These patients
are most often excluded from clinical trials, but we decided to keep them (and analyse their data) in order to
provide effectiveness estimates. Second, the ITT analysis set included in addition patients who reported at the
12-month visit that they had not been adherent to the intervention to which they had been assigned, which
in most cases, was due to a family situation (e.g. partner undergoing surgery). Again, some of these patients
would be excluded in traditional clinical trials. Finally, the per-protocol analysis set included patients who
did not make any spontaneous report in relation to their willingness or adherence, and probably comprised
both adherent and non-adherent patients, thus underestimating the efficacy of Urban Training.

A second limitation is the apparent discrepancy between efficacy and effectiveness results. Of note, both
approaches were prespecified in our analysis plan given previous reports in the literature about poor
adherence to behavioural interventions [9, 41] and the well-known argument against ITT analysis (that it
underestimates intervention effects in situations of non-adherence) [42]. The absence of effectiveness of
Urban Training suggests the need for research to understand and eventually to identify ways to act upon
the determinants of willingness and adherence to behavioural interventions in COPD. In our study,
airflow limitation, smoking habits, diabetes and depression symptoms, but not physical activity levels were
related to unwillingness or non-adherence, although collected information was not complete and there are
no previous data on these issues to compare with. In addition, it has been disputed that the adherence to a
given intervention may change dramatically after patients learn of trial findings, making the ITT effect
estimation different from the effectiveness of the intervention in the community [43]. From a clinical
viewpoint, patients who are willing to take an intervention such as Urban Training may be more interested
in the per-protocol than the ITT effect.

Other shortcomings include the lack of intermediate assessments during the follow-up period, which could
have given feedback to patients and would have allowed researchers to distinguish between short- and
long-term effects. In addition, the fact that ≈30% of patients were lost to follow-up, a comparable figure to
previous studies [6, 9, 10], could have biased our results. Finally, our patients exhibited higher physical
activity levels than those observed in previous studies [44–47], which could be considered a limitation of
our research. However, a comparison of the clinical characteristics and physical activity levels of the
patients included in the present and previous studies shows differences in physical activity both between
countries (for the same severity of COPD) and within countries (for different severity stages and/or
recruitment settings). We consider that, given that the Urban Training intervention was designed in a
region characterised by relatively high social support, the cultural habit of walking, pedestrian accessibility

to most outdoor public spaces, and a mild climate, it would be feasible in most Euro-Mediterranean cities.
However, other geographic areas would need to conduct a proper adaptation to their social, cultural and
environmental characteristics.

Strengths of the study are the novelty of customising the behavioural intervention to patients’ interpersonal
characteristics and environment, the large sample size and the measure of physical activity using an
accelerometer. In addition, patients were recruited from primary care and hospitals of several
municipalities, with barely any exclusion criteria, and diversity in relevant sociodemographic, lifestyle and
clinical parameters, which make our results generalisable to a wide COPD population. The lack of
differences in efficacy when patients were stratified according to their baseline features further supports the
generalisability of our findings. With regard to the intervention, its simplicity and reduced burden make it
possible to adapt it to other populations, including those with other chronic diseases and/or settings.

In conclusion, the Urban Training intervention, combining behavioural strategies with unsupervised
outdoor walking, was efficacious in increasing physical activity after 12 months in COPD patients.
However, it was ineffective in the full population including unwilling and self-reported non-adherent
patients. The Urban Training intervention had no effect on severe COPD exacerbations, functional
exercise capacity, body composition, health-related quality of life, anxiety or depression.
