### Introduction

##### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United
 States.[1] Observational studies[2-8] consistently show that physical inactivity is associated with

 increased hospitalizations and death. Moreover, it has previously been shown that hospitalized

 patients with COPD who engaged in physical activity (PA) before the index admission had a 34%
 lower risk of 30-day readmission compared with inactive patients.[9]

 Despite the unequivocal evidence that pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) improves patient centered outcomes,[10,11] participation remains dismal at approximately 5%[12,13] due to persistent
 barriers.[14,15] Health systems need alternative approaches to achieve more patient-centered care,

 with better outcomes at lower cost, for the majority of patients who are not able to participate in PR,
 especially in light of current national PA guidelines[16] and continued pressure to reduce
 readmissions.[17] Small studies[18-24] of PA interventions showed positive short-term to medium-term

 improvements in PA. The real-world and long-term effectiveness of interventions to increase PA and

 positively alter health care use in a large representative sample of older adults at high risk for

 recurrent COPD exacerbations remains unknown.

 To address this gap, we conducted a pragmatic randomized clinical trial to determine the

 effectiveness of a 12-month community-based PA coaching program (Walk On! [WO]) that was

 designed to be generalizable, scalable, and sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of a large diverse

 sample of patients with a history of COPD exacerbations. The WO intervention was designed based
 on learnings from a series of collective studies[24-27] by members of the investigative team that were

 informed by early and deep engagement with patient stakeholders and was grounded in social
 cognitive[28] and self-regulation[29,30] theories and core principles of motivational interviewing.[31] We

 hypothesized that the WO intervention would increase PA and consequently reduce future acute

 care use and death in patients who have had a previous COPD exacerbation.

### Methods

#### Study Design and Setting
##### This pragmatic randomized clinical trial compared the effectiveness of a 12-month PA intervention

 with standard care (SC) in patients with COPD. Written informed consent was obtained only from

 patients who were randomized to the WO intervention. The research question, design, and methods
 are aligned with methodological standards for pragmatic trials.[32,33] This study was approved by the

 Kaiser Permanente Southern California Institutional Review Board. The study took place at 8 medical

 centers within a large integrated health system. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of

 Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline.

-----

#### Study Population
##### English-speaking and Spanish-speaking patients with a COPD-related hospitalization, emergency

 department visit, or observation stay in the previous 12 months were identified from electronic

 medical records (EMRs). Patients were automatically excluded if the administrative and clinical EMR

 data showed that they had the following characteristics: they were younger than 40 years; they had
 a forced expiratory volume/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio exceeding 0.70; they were
 discharged to hospice or to another acute, postacute, or long-term care facility; they were

 nonambulatory at admission or discharge; they had Alzheimer disease, dementia, or metastatic

 cancer; they were morbidly obese (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by

 height in meters squared] >40); or they had completed PR in the last 6 months. No medical record

 reviews or further screenings were conducted. Eligible patients were identified and randomized for

 the study from July 1, 2015, to July 31, 2017, and were followed up through July 2018. The setting

 was Kaiser Permanente Southern California sites.

#### Randomization
##### A total of 2707 eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to the WO intervention or SC, stratified by

 medical center, time from COPD acute care event (<6 vs �6 months), self-reported PA obtained from
 the exercise vital sign[34] (inactive vs active), and median age (<72 vs �72 years) by random permuted

 block randomization. Patients randomized to WO received a recruitment letter and study brochure

 via postal mail and were followed up by telephone at least 10 business days after the mailing by

 existing clinical staff (respiratory therapists who served as the PA coaches) to assess their interest in
 WO. Following a single-consent, encouragement design,[35,36] only those assigned to WO were

 approached for written consent to participate in intervention activities. Therefore, 2 groups were

 formed within WO, namely, WO participants and WO nonparticipants. Patients assigned to SC were

 not contacted about the study except for a random subgroup who were invited to complete surveys
 during 12 months. Detailed study methods and implementation learnings have been published.[37,38]

 The trial protocol, including the scientific rationale for the study design, is available in Supplement 1.

#### Study Interventions
##### The WO intervention included collaborative monitoring of PA step counts, semiautomated step goal

 recommendations, individualized reinforcement, and peer/family support, with built-in flexibility to

 accommodate the diverse preferences and needs of patients, as well as anticipated implementation

 constraints. Walking was promoted as a primary mode of PA because almost 90% of activities that

 patients with COPD engage in are ambulatory in nature and walking is a safe and accessible form
 of PA.[39]

 The WO participants were sent a baseline previsit packet that included a consent form, activity

 sensor to wear for 7 days before the visit, and a survey packet (measures are described in the Study

 Outcomes subsection). During the baseline visit, the coach reviewed the survey responses, baseline

 PA, and performance on a 6-minute walk test to collaboratively design an individualized PA program

 for the patient, starting with an initial step goal for the first week.

 Patients received 4 weekly coaching phone calls during weeks 1 through 5 to reinforce or

 readjust the PA plan as needed. Outreach by the PA coaches for the remaining 11 months were

 individualized and targeted according to patients’ progress with their walking program, technical

 difficulties, or automated triggers from the study dashboard based on data submitted by patients.

 Depending on whether patients chose to use a low-tech or internet-enabled activity device, they

 uploaded or reported their PA and symptoms on a weekly basis via an interactive phone voice

 response system or web interface. Step goal recommendations were provided by the respective

 systems. Patients were also encouraged to attend monthly group support meetings with their peer/

 family caregivers.

#### Comparison Group
##### The SC patients continued to receive their routine care and had access to all health services in

 accordance with their health plan. Patients received no instructions to exercise and were not

 contacted about the trial except for a randomly selected subgroup (n = 537) to complete surveys for

 comparison with WO participants.

#### Study Outcomes
##### The primary outcome was a composite binary measure of any all-cause hospitalizations, observation

 stays, emergency department visits, and death. Secondary outcomes included COPD-related acute

 care use, cardiometabolic markers (blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, and lipids), and self reported PA.[34] Follow-up time was 12 months from the date of randomization. These outcomes were

 available for all patients from the EMRs. Additional secondary outcomes included the following:
 symptoms (COPD Assessment Test),[40] depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 8),[41] anxiety
 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7),[42] health-related quality of life (Patient-Reported Outcomes
 Measurement Information System 10 [PROMIS-10]),[43] and satisfaction with the program for a subset

 of the sample. These data were obtained from mailed surveys for all WO participants and a randomly

 selected subset of SC patients at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.

#### Sample Size and Statistical Analysis
##### Sample size was calculated based on estimates of acute care use and death from previous
 studies[9,44-46] and with the assumption that approximately 50% of the patients assigned to WO

 would participate in the intervention. Allowing for a 15% disenrollment from the health plan and

 2-tailed α = .05, we anticipated that by enrolling a total of 1650 patients we would have 80% power

 to detect an absolute reduction of 7% in the primary composite outcome (70% vs 63%). We reached

 the enrollment target after 12 months, but the participation rate remained low at 23.5% (147 of 625).

 The data and safety monitoring board approved a revised power calculation based on a projected

 accrual of 2700 patients through the end of the original 24-month recruitment timeline to detect a

 smaller difference of 5.5% (see eMethods in Supplement 2).

 The primary analyses followed the intent-to-treat (ITT) principle such that all randomized

 patients regardless of participation were included. Follow-up time was 12 months from the date of

 randomization. Secondary analyses included prespecified, as-treated analyses in which patients who

 participated in WO were compared with SC, and follow-up time was 2 to 12 months from the date of

 randomization. The first 2 months after randomization were excluded because it was expected that it

 would take approximately 2 months from the date of randomization to start the intervention.

 Therefore, only patients who were followed up for at least 2 months across both arms from the date

 of randomization were eligible for the as-treated analysis.

 For the intervention effects on outcomes, prespecified analyses used adjusted logistic

 regression as the primary approach for any occurrence of the outcomes within 12 months and used

 survival analysis as the secondary approach for time to the first occurrence of each outcome.

 Disenrollment rates were slightly higher in SC vs WO (7.9% [107 of 1349] vs 4.8% [65 of 1359]). For

 patients who disenrolled from the health plan, data before disenrollment were used, and the shorter

 duration of follow-up was incorporated into the survival analysis for all patients. All patients had data

 on primary outcomes after randomization. For the as-treated analysis, stabilized (standardized
 difference, <0.1) propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting[47] was used to balance

 baseline characteristics between patients who participated in WO and the SC group. The propensity

 of being a WO participant was calculated using a logistic regression model of baseline

 sociodemographics, health behaviors, disease severity, comorbidities, inhalers/medications, health

 care use in the prior year, and study site.

 The a priori threshold for statistical significance was a 2-sided P < .05. Results for the secondary

 analyses should be interpreted as exploratory due to multiple comparisons. All analyses were

 conducted using SAS, version 9.4 for Windows statistical software (SAS Institute Inc).

### Results

#### Patient Flow and Baseline Characteristics
##### A total of 2707 patients (baseline mean [SD] age, 72 [10] years; 53.7% female; 74.3% of white race/
 ethnicity; and baseline mean [SD] forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration (FEV1%)
 predicted, 61.0 [22.5]) were identified from the EMRs and randomized to WO (n = 1358) or SC

 (n = 1349). Only 321 of 1358 patients (23.6%) randomized to WO consented to participate in the

 intervention components and completed baseline surveys (Figure). In total, 471 of 1358 patients

 (34.6%) expressed no interest in the WO program. An additional 313 of 1358 patients (23.0%)

 passively declined to participate (patients who did not return our telephone calls despite 3 contacts).

 A total of 268 of 537 randomly sampled SC patients (49.9%) completed baseline surveys. Baseline

 characteristics were similar between all randomized WO and SC patients (Table 1 and eTable 1 in

 Supplement 2). In those randomized to WO, there were significant baseline differences between WO

 participants vs nonparticipants (fewer current smokers, greater use of long-acting inhalers, fewer

 comorbidities, fewer all-cause emergency department visits, more outpatient-treated COPD

 exacerbations, and greater use of specialty care).

#### WO Intervention Process Measures, PA, and Satisfaction
##### Approximately 83.3% (264 of 317) of WO participants completed at least 4 reinforcement telephone

 calls with the coaches in the first 5 weeks (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). The coaches’ documentation

 showed that they contacted and/or reviewed participants’ data on the study dashboard a median of

 12 times during weeks 6 through 52. Almost one-quarter (72 of 317 [22.7%]) of the participants

 experienced technical challenges with their activity sensors, requiring at least 1 replacement, and

 15.5% (50 of 321) chose not to use any of the study-issued devices. Less than half of the participants

 (n = 104 of 245) attended at least 1 optional monthly group visit. Participants who completed the

 6-month and 12-month surveys provided favorable ratings of the program, with the vast majority

 reporting that it was easy to fit into their lifestyle (93.2% [165 of 177] on the 6-month survey and

 97.1% [135 of 139] on the 12-month survey) and that they would recommend the program to others

 (97.8% [175 of 179] on the 6-month survey and 99.3 % [138 of 139] on the 12-month survey).

 Step counts from any of the 3 activity sensors during 12 months showed that participants with

 higher step counts at baseline (�5000 steps per day) tended to decline, whereas those with lower

 step counts at baseline (<5000 steps per day) remained steady (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2).

 Measures of self-reported PA (the exercise vital sign from the EMRs) in the 12 months after

 randomization were not significantly different between WO and SC groups in the ITT analysis

 (Table 2). However, there was a higher percentage of WO participants engaging in any PA (47.4% [152

 of 321] vs 30.7% [414 of 1349]; P < .001) or meeting recommended PA levels (21.5% [69 of 321] vs

 12.7% [171 of 1349]; P < .001) compared with SC.

#### Primary ITT Findings for Acute Care Use and Death
##### For all randomized patients, there was no significant difference in the primary composite outcome of

 all-cause hospitalizations, observation stays, emergency department visits, and death between WO

 and SC in the 12 months after randomization (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.92-1.28; P = .33)

 (Table 3). There were also no between-group differences in the individual primary outcomes or

 COPD-related acute care use (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.93-1.31; P = .26). Time-to-first-event models

 similarly showed no differences between groups (eTable 3 and eFigure 2 in Supplement 2). The rate

 of falls with injuries was similar between groups. Prespecified interaction tests to assess whether the

 intervention effects differed by baseline morbidities, level of social support, race/ethnicity, age, sex,

 and internet access did not identify significant subgroup effects.

-----

#### As-Treated Findings for Acute Care Use and Death
##### During 10 months of follow-up, there were non–statistically significant positive estimates in favor of

 WO participants compared with all SC patients on all-cause hospitalizations (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65
 1.10; P = .21) and death (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.35-1.11; P = .11) (Table 3). Adjusted time-to-first-event

 analyses showed similar estimates, with significant group differences in observation stays (hazard

 ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53-0.98; P = .04) (eTable 3 and eFigure 3 in Supplement 2).

#### Secondary Outcomes
##### There were no differences between WO participants and SC survey responders on the baseline to

 6-month or 12-month changes in the COPD Assessment Test, Patient Health Questionnaire 8, or

 Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7. Exceptions were the PROMIS-10 physical health domain (effect size,

 0.25; 95% CI, 0.05-0.45; P = .01) and sedentary time (effect size, −0.26; 95% CI, −0.48 to −0.04;

 P = .02) at 6 months (Table 4). There were no significant group differences in cardiometabolic

 markers for both the as-treated analyses and the ITT analyses (eTable 4 in Supplement 2).

### Discussion

##### In this multisite pragmatic randomized clinical trial, a 12-month community-based PA coaching

 intervention had no effect on the primary composite outcome of all-cause acute care use and death

##### in patients at high risk for recurrent COPD exacerbations. The lack of effects is at least partly

 attributable to the suboptimal uptake, with only one-quarter (321 of 1358) of the randomized

 patients participating in the intervention, the low intervention intensity, and the reduced

 engagement during the 12 months. The prespecified, as-treated analyses, which included only

 patients who participated in any WO intervention component, showed nonsignificant estimates

 favoring WO for reduced acute care use and death compared with controls.

 The null results from our ITT analyses are not very different from those of 2 recent,
 multicomponent COPD self-management studies.[48,49] While both studies showed short-term

 reductions in COPD-related hospitalizations and/or emergency department visits at 6 months,

 neither showed a persistent effect at 12 months. Moreover, neither intervention had a significant
 influence on all-cause hospitalizations or death at 6 or 12 months. These 2 studies[48,49] also differed

 from our study in several ways. Our study was focused on increasing PA and prioritizing

 generalizability by randomizing all patients who had any COPD-related acute care event in the

 previous 12 months, with few exclusions, relying solely on EMR data without performing medical
 record reviews. In contrast, these 2 efficacy studies[48,49] conducted extensive medical record reviews

 and screenings before recruiting patients, while they were still hospitalized, and ultimately enrolled

 and randomized 22% to 30% of likely the most motivated patients. Acceptability of WO to patients

 and level of participation are essential components of the real-world effectiveness. If trial enrollment

 was limited to those who volunteered, findings regarding intervention acceptability or adherence at

##### the population level would have limited scientific value and clinical operations utility for health

 systems in their decision to invest in such programs.

 While WO participation fell short of our target, the 23.6% (321 of 1358) uptake is considerable
 when contrasted with participation in PR by Medicare beneficiaries (4%) with COPD[13] or among
 those who had a recent COPD hospital discharge (2.7%)[12] or among patients exposed to lighter touch no-cost behavioral programs (2%).[50] Nonetheless, health systems need to weigh the

 resources associated with broad outreach efforts and the yield in patient engagement, especially in

 response to the recent PA guidelines recommending that all older adults and those with chronic
 conditions engage in some level of PA.[16] When contacted, approximately 34.6% (471 of 1358) of

 patients in our study expressed no interest in the WO program. However, the rate of disinterested

 patients would increase to 57.7% (784 of 1358) if passive declines (patients who did not return our

 calls despite 3 contacts) were included. With more persuasive advice from existing trusted health

 care professionals vs the constrained recruitment consenting language required of research studies,

 it is possible that participation in programs like WO might be higher. Alternatively, our experience

 may be as good as it gets, where up to one-half of the target population may not be activated and

 may choose not to engage in any PA outreach efforts due to other competing priorities. Better

 methods for identifying activated patients who are contemplating change are needed to yield a

 higher return.

 The WO intervention had a favorable effect on the process outcome of PA (captured in routine

 care for all patients), as reflected by a greater proportion of WO participants reporting engagement in
 any PA or at least 150 minutes per week of PA (meeting national guidelines[16]) compared with
 controls. A recent European study[20] testing a similar PA intervention also found significant

 improvements in PA in the as-treated analyses but not in the ITT analyses. In addition, there were

 modest but significant improvements in the PROMIS-10 physical health domain and sedentary time

 among WO participants at 6 months compared with a subset of control survey respondents, but this

 effect dissipated by 12 months due to decreased engagement over time, a common observation that

##### is similar to previous PA studies.[18,51] Together, these findings suggest that the PA coaching

 intervention positively affected self-reported PA, inactivity, and physical quality of life but may not

 have been of sufficient dose across the target population (and with limited power) to have a

 significant, consistent influence on more distal outcomes of acute care use and survival, as seen in

 the as-treated analyses.
 An earlier observational study[52] examining PA intensity and duration using accelerometer data

 found that low-intensity PA had a protective effect on risk of COPD hospitalization, with no benefit

 from high-intensity PA. In fact, for every 1000-step increase in low-intensity PA, there was a 20% risk
 reduction in COPD hospitalizations.[52] In our study, although the risk estimate for the as-treated

 analysis of COPD-related acute care use was in a favorable direction, the significant finding with

 all-cause observation stays suggests that being physically active may be associated with fewer, less

 severe hospital encounters that do not require an admission. Because use of observation stays is a

 new phenomenon in response to the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, there is little
 published research on how interventions alter these encounters in patients with COPD.[53-55]

#### Strengths and Limitations
##### There are several strengths to our study. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, health systems

 effort to engage a diverse and broadly representative sample of patients at high risk for recurrent

 COPD exacerbations to address a key question of uptake and long-term effectiveness of a scalable

 and affordable approach to PA promotion. The WO intervention was intentionally designed to be

 easily integrated in patients’ daily lives. This tailored approach of encouraging increased PA based on

 individual needs and preferences is also consistent with the primary PA guideline
 recommendations.[16]

 Our study also had limitations. Given the need for automated identification and randomization

 of eligible patients using EMR data to ensure broadest representation, we could not rely on

 spirometry as an inclusion criterion and may have included some patients without COPD. More

 importantly, our goal was to align with the real-world policy and practice, relying solely on the
 administrative and clinical data from the EMRs to identify eligible patients.[56] However, our decision

 to be broadly inclusive of patients who may have been experiencing rapid decline in their health and

 who may have not benefited from the intervention likely contributed to the low uptake and

 engagement over time.

 Despite our attempts to accommodate patient preferences by offering and integrating the 3

 activity sensors into our system, the multiple technical challenges with the devices likely contributed

 to disengagement by some participants even though the coaches encouraged patients to prioritize

 accumulating PA time instead of their step counts when they had technical difficulties. While the

 individualized WO intervention may be perceived as being too heterogeneous, not being intensive or

 multifaceted, or not having rigorous fidelity control, the goal of the study was to work within the

 real-world constraints to test a scalable and affordable approach to promoting PA using existing

 frontline clinical staff. We relied on the exercise vital sign, a self-reported measure obtained from

 routine care, as a key process outcome because it was not practical to measure objective PA across

 all patients. The high level of missingness in the patient-reported outcomes and the multiple

 comparisons suggest caution in interpreting the significant PROMIS-10 findings. Despite our efforts

 to adjust for selection bias in the as-treated analyses, residual confounding is an important limitation.

 The study draws from a population of insured patients from an integrated system, potentially
 limiting generalizability. Compared with other recently published COPD studies,[48] our study sample

 appeared to be already optimized with their COPD, cardiovascular, and diabetic care, as reflected in

 the prescribed inhalers and cardiometabolic markers, with potentially little room for additional

 change. This is well illustrated with the attenuated effects of cardiac rehabilitation on death and
 cardiac events in recent trials compared with earlier studies, likely due to therapeutic advances.[57]

### Conclusions

##### In this pragmatic randomized clinical trial of patients at high risk for recurrent COPD exacerbations, a

 potentially scalable and sustainable 12-month PA coaching intervention was associated with

 increased self-reported PA and modest improvements in the PROMIS-10 physical quality of life

 domain but had no significant effects on the primary composite outcome of acute care use and death

 for both as-treated analyses and ITT analyses. Findings from this study call for more realistic

 expectations for frail, older patients with serious chronic conditions to engage in and meet PA

 recommendations and for increased PA to have an influence on distal outcomes. Future methods

 work is needed to more efficiently identify activated patients for behavioral interventions.
