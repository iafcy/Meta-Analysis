Summary
Background: Higher levels of physical activity are associated with better functional status,
fewer hospital admissions, and lower mortality. In this pilot study, we examined the feasibility
and safety of a novel program that combines a pedometer with a website to increase walking.
Methods: 27 persons with stable COPD wore the Omron HJ-720ITC pedometer and used the
website for 90 days. They uploaded step-count data to the study server using their home
computer and received an email each week with their individualized step-count goal. The website provided step-count feedback, education, and motivational content. Subjects participated in a monthly semi-structured interview by telephone. Subjects reported changes in
medical condition by telephone or on the website. Paired T-tests assessed change in daily step
counts.
Results: Subjects were males, mean age 72 � 8 years, with moderate COPD, FEV1 1.57 � 0.48 L
(55 � 16% predicted). 87% and 65% reported no problems using the pedometer and website,

#### Introduction


respectively. At month 3, 96% reported it was true that they knew their step count goal every
day, and 52% reported that they were able to reach their goal. 95% of participants said they
would recommend the walking program to another person with COPD. Eight subjects experienced breathing problems unrelated to the intervention. In 24 subjects with step counts at
baseline and month 3, there was a significant increase of 1263 steps per day (approximately
1.0 km), p Z 0.0054.
Conclusions: The use of a website and pedometer was feasible and safe, and persons increased
their daily walking.

A growing body of knowledge has identified physical
activity as a modifiable factor that may impact morbidity
and mortality in persons with COPD. Higher levels of physical activity are associated with better functional status,
fewer hospital admissions, and lower mortality,[1][e][4] resulting
in the recommendation that “it should be considered a high
priority for future COPD therapies to ameliorate
inactivity.[5,6]”
Current therapies to increase physical activity in COPD
have significant limitations. Pulmonary rehabilitation
programs clearly improve exercise capacity in persons with
COPD.[6] However, they are based at large medical centers or
outpatient medical offices, require specialized resources,
and require patients to travel 2e3 times each week for
9e12 weeks.[6] It is also unclear whether the improvements
in exercise capacity, measured by episodic in-clinic tests,
translate into increases in daily physical activities such as
walking.[7] Current home-based exercise programs are
limited by inability to accurately monitor exercise,
depending on self-report and need for phone calls or home
visits.[8][e][14] Furthermore, they have lacked mechanisms for
iterative feedback and dynamic, individualized goal
setting.
Walking is a form of physical activity that most people
can do; it is generally a safe, convenient, and inexpensive
way to increase physical activity. Steps per day is a simple
metric of physical activity that is meaningful to persons
trying to increase their activity.[15] In COPD, a higher daily
step count is associated with lower mortality, independent
of pulmonary function.[4] Although many pedometer-based
programs have been studied to increase walking in
healthy adults,[16,17] only a few studies have used pedometers to report changes in daily step counts in COPD.[15,18][e][20]

We previously described a novel exercise program called
Stepping Up to Health (SUH) that combined the use of the
Omron HJ-720ITC pedometer with a website to promote
walking in persons with cardiovascular disease risk
factors.[21,22] The program accurately monitors walking with
a pedometer, provides iterative feedback and goals in steps
per day, and delivers education and motivation online. We
have extended SUH to include website content specific for
persons with COPD. This adapted walking program is called
Every Step Counts (ESC) for Lung Health. In this pilot study,
we examined the use of ESC in persons with COPD. Our
specific aims were to (1) obtain feedback from participants,


#### Methods

##### Study population

From February to November 2011, we enrolled participants
with COPD, defined as age over 40 years, forced expiratory
volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC)
<0.70 or emphysema on chest computed tomography, and
a smoking history of >10 pack-years. Subjects were
excluded if they did not have Internet access, were unable
to ambulate, or were currently enrolled in a pulmonary
rehabilitation program. All subjects participated in stable
health status, with no COPD exacerbation within the
previous 4 weeks. The protocol was approved by the VA
Boston Healthcare System Committee on Human Research.
Subjects provided written informed consent and obtained
medical clearance from their healthcare provider.

##### Study protocol

At baseline study visit, participants completed a survey on
the website that assessed demographics, medical history,
and study outcomes. Values for FEV1 were obtained from
medical chart review. We used the waist-mounted Omron
HJ-720ITC pedometer which has been shown to be accurate
in persons with COPD.[22] Subjects were instructed to upload
step counts to the study server at least weekly, using their
home computer and the USB cable. Subjects collected
baseline step counts by wearing the pedometer, with
a sticker on its face to prevent feedback, for 7 days and
engaging in their usual physical activities. After participants uploaded their baseline step counts, they received an
email with their first step-count goal and instructions to
remove the sticker. At that time, participants could access
all contents on the website.
Subjects wore the pedometer during waking hours for
the 90-day monitoring period, excluding periods of bathing
or water activities. Subjects participated in monthly semistructured telephone interviews that assessed feedback.
Subjects reported changes in their medical condition by
telephone or on the website. If they experienced medical
problems that prevented walking, they were temporarily
suspended from the study and resumed when they were at

baseline clinical status. Subjects completed an end-ofstudy survey on the website which assessed study
outcomes.

##### Components of Every Step Counts (ESC) walking program

ESC is based on the behavioral theory of self-regulation
which emphasizes an iterative process of behavior
change.[23,24] Feedback, goal setting, and motivation are
critical components of the cycle of self-regulation.[22,25,26]

(1) Feedback. The pedometer, with on-instrument data
presentation, provided subjects with continuous stepcount feedback. On their personal webpage, subjects
could view graphical displays of daily step counts from
the current and previous weeks (Fig. 1).
(2) Goal setting. An individualized step-count goal was
calculated with an automated algorithm. Each week’s
goal was the lowest of three possible numbers: (1) the
average of the most recent 7 days of step counts 400
þ
steps, (2) the previous goal 400 steps, or (3) 10,000
þ
steps per day. An 800 step increment was used in SUH
for persons with cardiovascular disease risk factors,[21,22]

and 400 steps were selected as an attainable increase
for a COPD cohort. Each Sunday, subjects received an
email with the week’s step-count goal, which was also
displayed on their webpage (Fig. 1).


(3) Motivational messages (Figs. 2 and 3). Presented on
their webpage, motivational messages provided strategies to overcome general barriers (bad weather, lack
of time) and COPD-specific barriers to walking (fear of
becoming short of breath, embarrassment with using
breathing medications and/or oxygen during walking).
Educational tips were short paragraphs with links to
other publicly available websites, such as those of the
American College of Chest Physicians and Living Well
with COPD. They provided general and COPD-specific
education, such as the benefits of walking and use of
bronchodilators prior to walking.

##### Outcome measures

The primary outcome was daily step counts. Step counts for
any 24-h period were considered valid if the total counts
were >100 and the pedometer had been worn for at least
8 h.[21,22] Average baseline step count was calculated if valid
data were available for at least 5 of the 7 days. Daily step
counts for month 1 were averaged from days 1 to 30, for
month 2 from days 31 to 60, and for month 3 from days 61 to
90 (end of study).
Baseline and end-of-study surveys assessed secondary
outcomes. Health status was assessed with the Medical
Outcome Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) question, “In general,
how would you rate your health?”.[27,28] Dyspnea was
assessed using the modified Medical Research Council

(MMRC) dyspnea scale (responses 0e4, with 4 being the
most dyspneic).[29] We administered the 5 questions from the
exercise domain of the Bristol COPD Knowledge Questionnaire and scored the percentage of questions answered
correctly.[30] We also administered the 16-item Exercise SelfRegulatory Efficacy Scale (Ex-SRES) for persons with COPD,
which asks subjects to rate how confident they are to
exercise 3 times a week for 20 min under different
scenarios.[31] Scores range from 1 to 100 with higher scores
reflecting greater self-regulatory efficacy.

##### Statistical analysis

Analyses were performed with SAS (version 9.1, SAS Institute; Cary, NC). Data were analyzed for 27 subjects who
had baseline step counts, wore the pedometer for at least
one month, and participated in at least one of the
following: the baseline survey, feedback telephone calls, or
the end-of-study survey. 507 of the 2430 study days (21%)
had missing or invalid step counts. Three participants (2
with medical problems who did not complete study and 1
who dropped out) had no step-count data in month 3 and
were excluded from the end-of-study to baseline paired Ttest. Subjects with valid step counts for any number of days
in month 3 were included. We also performed a sensitivity
analysis with subjects who had valid step count data for at
least 20 of 30 days in month 3. An additional 2 participants
(1 with medical problems who resumed study and 1 who did


not upload step counts) had no step-count data in month 1
or 2. Therefore, in 22 participants, analysis of variance
assessed the trend in daily step counts by month of study. p
Value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

#### Results

##### Subject characteristics

The 27 subjects were males, with mean age 72 8 years
�
and moderate COPD, FEV1 1.57 � 0.48 L (55 � 16% predicted)[32] (Table 1). All were former smokers, 9 subjects
used supplemental oxygen, and 7 had previously participated in a pulmonary rehabilitation program. For worsening
of breathing over the past year, 5 subjects had been
hospitalized, 5 had required an antibiotic, and 6 required
an oral corticosteroid. Eighteen subjects reported using the
Internet almost every day.

##### Participant feedback

At month 3, 87% and 65% of subjects reported no problems
using the pedometer and website, respectively, compared
to 78% and 52% at month 1. The most common problems
were the pedometer easily detaching from the waist and
difficulty with the first upload of step counts. Subjects used
the step count graphs most frequently, with 91% using them

in month 3 (Table 2). At month 3, 96% of subjects reported
they knew their step count goal every day, compared to 81%
at month 1. The percentage of subjects who reported they
were able to reach their goal each week decreased from
67% at month 1 to 52% at month 3. 95% of participants said
they would recommend the walking program to another
person with COPD.

##### Safety

Two subjects had mild leg pain that was associated with the
walking intervention. Five subjects experienced a serious
adverse event requiring hospitalization. Three subjects
were hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation, 1 subject was
hospitalized for chest pain, and 1 hospitalized for gallstones. All serious adverse events were judged by the study
physician to be unrelated to the exercise intervention.
During the study, an additional 5 subjects experienced
worsening of breathing requiring treatment with prednisone and/or antibiotics.

##### Daily step counts

In 24 subjects, daily step counts were 2908 at baseline and
4171 at month 3, with a significant increase of 1263 steps
per day, p Z 0.0054 (Table 3). The average weekly goal


increased from 3217 steps per day at week 1 to 3979 steps
per day at week 12. For these 24 subjects, the median
number of days in month 3 with valid step counts was 29
(range 11e30 days, mean 26 6 days). In a sensitivity
�
analysis with 20 subjects who had valid step count data for
at least 20 of 30 days in month 3, daily step counts were
3307 at baseline and 4837 at month 3, with an increase of
1530 steps per day. In 22 subjects with step-count data at
baseline, months 1, 2, and 3, there was a significant trend
of increasing step counts by month of study, with average
daily steps of 2978 (baseline), 3517 (month 1), 4030 (month
2), and 4409 (month 3), p Z 0.024.

##### Secondary outcomes

At baseline, 82% of participants reported overall health to
be good, fair, or poor (Table 1) and 44% had an MMRC
dyspnea score of 2. On baseline assessment of COPD
�
knowledge of exercise, 59% of the questions were answered
correctly. 78% of subjects answered incorrectly that it is
true that exercise should be stopped if it makes you
breathless. The Ex-SRES showed that subjects were least
confident that they could continue exercise if they felt sick
(55%), tired (69%), or short of breath (69%). At end of study,
there was no significant change in secondary outcomes
(Table 3).

#### Discussion

Our pilot study demonstrates that it is feasible and safe for
persons with COPD to increase their daily walking using an
innovative program that combines a pedometer with
a website. A recent survey showed that 78% of adult
Americans use the Internet[33] suggesting that it could be
a platform for implementing a widely accessible exercise
program. A few pilot studies have used mobile devices,


such as cell phones and personal digital assistants (PDA),
which interface with the Internet to promote physical
activity in persons with COPD.[20,34,35] These programs
required self-monitoring and entering exercise information
into the devices. In contrast, our program requires minimal
manipulation by the participant. We demonstrate that the
technology was well-received and observed good compliance and retention, with one subject who did not upload
counts on a weekly basis and one subject who dropped out.
The increase in daily step counts of 1263 steps per day
(approximately 1.0 km) is in the range of that observed in
two previous studies that have used pedometers in COPD.
Persons in an exercise counseling program increased
walking by 785 steps per day compared to a control group.[18]

Persons in a regular pulmonary rehabilitation plus counseling intervention showed an increase of 1787 steps per
day compared to a control group that participated only in
pulmonary rehabilitation.[19] We previously reported that
persons with COPD who used SUH had an increase of 988
steps per day[22] and hypothesized that adapting the content
of SUH to be specific for COPD would result in further gains.
The absence of significant further gains in step counts may
be due to differences in disease severity or season of
monitoring between the two studies.[36] It is also possible
that participants had reached the maximum amount of
walking they could do as suggested by the decrease in
subjects who reported being able to reach their weekly
goals at month 3.
Studies that have demonstrated an association between
higher daily step counts and better functional status,
better health-related quality of life, and lower mortality,
independent of lung function, have not distinguished step
counts from aerobic walking versus walking as part of
activities of daily living.[3,4,37,38] These studies suggest that
any increase in daily step count could confer health benefits. Therefore, our program focused on increasing all step
counts both those from walking for exercise and from
overall increases in activities of daily living. In addition, it is
crucial to understand barriers to walking, since every step
counts.[39,40] Our results provide additional evidence that
overall knowledge of exercise is poor and identify shortness
of breath, illness, and fatigue as barriers to exercise selfregulation. We included the secondary outcomes for
exploratory purposes to assess baseline knowledge and

exercise self-regulation, and to see how feasible it is for
questions to be answered online. The study was not powered to see differences in these outcomes and we are not
surprised by the lack of change observed.
Our study has several limitations. It is a pilot study
mainly to determine feasibility and safety. It was performed in a convenience sample of male subjects at a single
site, limiting the generalizability of the results. There is no
control arm, so future studies are needed to distinguish the
effects of the pedometer from the effects of the website.
Longer follow-up in future studies are also needed to assess
the duration of benefit beyond the 90-day intervention
period, and longer periods of the intervention are needed
to assess long-term changes and adherence. Over half of
the participants in the current study had little dyspnea and
reported good or very good general health status, and
future studies including subjects representing the entire
range of COPD severity and symptoms are needed to assess
the role of this intervention in COPD.
We chose 7 days as our baseline monitoring period since
7-day monitoring periods have been routinely used in
physical activity monitor studies because they provide
a sufficiently large number of days to achieve intraclass
correlations of more than 80% in most populations, while
also providing the opportunity to sample behavior on both
week and week-end days.[41] We believe that the absolute
baseline daily step count is less important than the
continued increase in daily step counts by month of study
seen in the cohort. For example, it is possible that week 2
or 3 more accurately represented a subject’s baseline, but
the goals would be calculated based on iterative, updated
values and continue to promote increases in daily step
counts. Persons who did not fully adhere to the 3-month
walking program were included in the analysis to minimize
missing data. However, this may have resulted in conservative estimates of change in step counts because persons
who participated in the entire intervention may be expected to walk more. In the sensitivity analysis with subjects
who had valid step count data for at least 20 of 30 days in
month 3, baseline and end-of-study step counts were higher
compared to results for the subjects with any valid step
counts in month 3. We chose not to perform simple imputation or carry forward step-count values as the data were
not missing completely at random, and these methods
would result in biased estimates. The omitted answers on
the survey questions appeared to be missing completely at


random and unrelated to level of walking. We acknowledge
that response behavior to questions administered by
a computer may differ from administration by paper and
pencil.
In summary, this walking program is safe and feasible.
Persons with COPD can increase their daily walking with the
use of a pedometer and website. Our preliminary results
need to be confirmed in future studies but our results
suggest that this intervention has the potential to provide
a widely accessible, ongoing home-based exercise program.
