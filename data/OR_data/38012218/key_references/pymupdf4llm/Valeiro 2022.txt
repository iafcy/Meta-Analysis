Therefore, there is a need for early interventions after COPD
exacerbations to reverse the detrimental effects of these events.
Indeed, there may be a window of opportunity, albeit
challenging, for promoting physical activity in patients with
COPD following an exacerbation.[11,12] Early post-exacerbation
interventions might improve disease progression by helping
patients fully recover from these events and avoiding
further exacerbations. However, this path has been scarcely
studied and with poor results.[13] In a recent systematic review
analysing the effect of pedometer-based physical activity
promotion,[14] only one study[15] recruited patients during a
COPD exacerbation. Unfortunately, the trial failed to show
differences in physical activity between groups, which were all
still very inactive at the end of the study. Therefore, it remains
unclear, whether a physical activity intervention following
hospitalization for a severe COPD exacerbation might work.
We hypothesized that a 12-week, patient-tailored,
pedometer-based, progressive and target-driven program
could increase daily physical activity and reduce sedentary
behaviour in patients with COPD following hospitalization
for an exacerbation.

## METHODS


SUMMARY AT A GLANCE


We assessed the efficacy of a physical activity program after hospitalization for a COPD exacerbation.
The participants of a 12-week patient-tailored,
pedometer-based, progressive and target-driven
physical activity program, increased their daily steps
compared to control group after discharge.

Upon discharge, patients were given an accelerometer to
measure their physical activity. The patients returned 1 week
after discharge for baseline assessments and randomization
(visit 2). They were randomized 1:1 to either the control group
(CG) or the intervention group (IG) (Appendix S2 in the Supporting Information). Information regarding blinding of study
personnel is detailed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information.
The patients underwent a standard medical visit 4 weeks
later (visit 3) and the final evaluation took place 12 weeks
after randomization (visit 4) (Figure 1).


This was a prospective, 12-week, multicentre, two-arm parallel group, assessor-blind and randomized control trial
(NCT03084874). The study was conducted according to the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and it is reported
according to the CONSORT statement.[16,17]

## Study participants


## Intervention

Our program aimed to increase physical activity and reduce
sedentary behaviour through three components:


Patients hospitalized due to a COPD exacerbation were
asked to participate if they: (i) were adults aged 40 years or
older, with COPD confirmed by forced spirometry; (ii) had
smoking history of ≥10 packs/year and (iii) were willing to
participate and provide signed consent. We excluded
patients if: (i) were admitted to the ICU; (ii) hospitalized
more than once in the previous 12 months; (iii) required
newly prescribed oxygen therapy at discharge; (iv) had
severe physical or psychological limitations; (v) were attending a pulmonary rehabilitation program and (vi) were
unable to understand Spanish or Catalan. No changes in the
eligibility criteria were made throughout the duration of the
study.

## Study visits


The study was organized in four visits (Figure 1). The
screening visit (visit 1) was conducted during hospitalization
and after obtaining informed consent. All the patients
received standard medical care and supervised Monday-toFriday physical exercise by a respiratory physiotherapist to
minimize the effects of prolonged bedrest during their hospit l t (App di S1 i th S pp ti I f ti )


1. A motivational interview to explore the patient’s ambivalences towards being more active and to assist them in
tipping the decision balance in favour of change[18]

(Appendix S3 in the Supporting Information).
2. A personalized physical activity program with a pedometer
and a printed calendar to engage the subject in an individualized, 12-week, progressive and steps-targeted intervention. The program aimed to achieve a 20% monthly
increment on the number of steps from the individual
baseline level (i.e., Mean number of steps after discharge).
The targeted step number was broken down weekly for the
participants. Detailed program progression is available in
Appendix S4 in the Supporting Information.
3. Weekly telephone calls with the participants to assess
their progress, discuss possible barriers and set new
weekly physical activity goals (Appendix S4 in the Supporting Information). Moreover, the intervention was
reinforced in person during visit 3.

Patients in the CG followed the standard clinical discharge
management plan. After randomization, these patients were
briefly advised to meet international recommendations[18] (i.e., at
least 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity
weekly) and to complete their prescribed medical treatment.


## Outcomes

The primary outcomes were: (i) change in physical activity

spent on sedentary activities [sitting or lying]). As complementary physical activity information, data on walking time,
standing time and time spent on light and at least moderate
physical activity (>3 METS) were collected.
We objectively measured physical activity with the
Dynaport accelerometer (McRoberts BV, The Hague, The
Netherlands) which has previously been validated in
COPD.[19,20] Patients wore the device for a 7-day period during waking hours, placed on the centre of the lower back
with an elastic strap. A valid measurement was defined as a
minimum of 4 days with at least 8 h of recording time.[21]

As secondary outcomes we measured: (i) functional
exercise capacity with the distance walked in the 6-min walk
test (6MWD)[22]; (ii) quadriceps muscle force with a handheld dynamometer[23] and (iii) health status (the COPD
Assessment Test [CAT]).[24]

## COPD exacerbations and other adverse events


group differences were analysed using linear mixed effect
models, adjusting for group, time and group � time interaction. Goodness of fit was assessed by means of normality of
residuals. Intra-group differences were analysed using the
paired t-test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. All
statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 26 (IBM
Corp, Armonk, NY) and Stata 12.1 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX).

## RESULTS


Data regarding COPD exacerbations, related hospitalizations and other adverse events were collected throughout
the study. Moderate exacerbations were defined as an acute
worsening of respiratory symptoms resulting in additional
therapy,[25] whereas severe exacerbations granted hospitalization. Patients were excluded only if they presented a COPD
exacerbation, moderate or severe, between visit 1 and
2 (Appendix S4 in the Supporting Information).

## Statistical analysis


Sample size power estimation is detailed in Appendix S5 in
the Supporting Information.
Results are expressed as absolute numbers and their corresponding percentages for qualitative variables, as the mean
and SD for quantitative variables with a normal distribution
and as the median and 25th–75th percentiles for quantitative variables with a non-normal distribution. Between

Between March 2017 and December 2019, we recruited
61 patients among 198 patients assessed for eligibility. After
baseline assessment, 46 patients were randomized and
43 completed the study (Figure 2).
The in-hospital and baseline characteristics were similar
in the two groups (Table 1). Patients were a mean (SD) of
66 (10) years old, the majority of subjects (74%) were male
and spent 8 (2) days hospitalized. After discharge, they had
severe airflow limitation (forced expiratory volume in 1 s

[FEV1] 46 [16] % predicted), mild breathlessness (modified
Medical Research Council [mMRC] score, median [p25–75],
1[1–2]), showed preserved functional exercise capacity
(6MWD of 428 [121] m) and walked 5676 (3398) steps/day.
After 12 weeks of intervention, the number of steps/day
compared to baseline significantly increased only in the IG
(mean difference [95% CI] 2932 [1069–4795] steps; p = 0.004;
Table 2). In the linear mixed effect model, the difference in
mean steps between groups was 2093 steps/day, p = 0.018,
95% CI 376–4012 (Table 2, Figure 3). Normality of residuals
goodness of fit tests showed no relevant abnormality.
There was no other statistically significant betweengroup change in the rest of the primary and secondary outcomes (Table 2).
The overall incidence of COPD exacerbations during
follow-up was similar in both groups: 7 (30%) patients in
the CG and 7 (35%) patients in the IG had at least one moderate exacerbation. Only one (5%) patient (IG) was

hospitalized due to a severe COPD exacerbation during the
study. Regarding other adverse events, one (5%) patient in
the IG had an arm fracture.

## DISCUSSION


This clinical trial shows that patients with COPD significantly improved the number of daily steps following a
12-week physical activity program after hospitalization. This
finding supports our hypothesis that a patient-tailored,
pedometer-based, progressive and target-driven program
can boost daily physical activity in patients with COPD after
a severe exacerbation.
To our knowledge, these are the first data demonstrating
that a physical activity program following hospitalization
might be effective in selected patients with COPD. Patients
in the IG achieved a significant improvement in the number
of daily steps, above the reported MICD,[26] while

maintaining the overall sedentary behaviour. This finding
may be explained by a change in the physical activity profile
of the patients in the IG that increased their walking time
and the physical activity intensity, while preserving their
sedentary time (Table 2).
These improvements in physical activity after a COPD
exacerbation differ from other studies, specifically from
Hornikx et al.[15] However, several differences between the two
studies could explain these discrepancies. First, we defined
our study inclusion and exclusion criteria to overcome some
of the reported difficulties (i.e., Hospital re-admissions), and,
therefore have better fit candidates. Second, our program was
of longer duration (12 vs. 4 weeks). Third, our intervention
was based on an in-person motivational interview that
included discussion about barriers and enablers to physical
activity.[27,28] In contrast, the study by Hornikx relied on telephone contacts, which might have precluded patients to discuss further motivational aspects. Finally, it is known that
hospital admissions have a significant impact on exercise

did not objectively measure the adherence, we are confident
that most of our participants followed the intervention
based on patients’ high motivation to walk after discharge
(Table 1), the successful periodic telephone contacts that
ensured patient tracking, the absence of dropouts and our
positive results. Also, recent research has shown that
patients have some positive attitudes towards physical activity following hospitalization[28] and these might be used to
enhance a more active behaviour and gain momentum to
use that period as a window of opportunity for behavioural
change.[12]


Our intervention did not reduce sedentary behaviour as
hypothesized. We anticipated that if patients became
more active, their sedentary time would decrease.[31]

An explanation for our finding may be that the study intervention was primarily focused on increasing physical activity, as the target goals were set in steps per day without
objectively monitoring goals on sedentary behaviour. While
it has been shown that sedentary behaviour modification
interventions alone might be more effective than in conjunction with physical activity goals,[32] there is still no clear evidence regarding this.[33] Given the impact of sedentary
behaviour on the course of COPD,[34] more studies are
needed to clarify the relationship between physical activity
and sedentary behaviour in patients with COPD to design
better interventions.
Spontaneous physical activity recovery after a COPD
hospitalization is very limited.[8,35,36] Therefore, our results
have encouraging clinical implications to improve the recovery of patients with COPD and break the vicious circle of
dyspnoea-inactivity after these events.[10]

Although pulmonary rehabilitation has been found to be
safe and effective after a COPD exacerbation,[37] it is scarcely
accessible to patients[38] so physical activity programs might
be a good alternative. We found that it is possible to increase
the number of daily steps in patients with COPD after a
severe exacerbation. However, it remains unclear if having a
preserved exercise capacity and being already somewhat
active before the hospitalization is a requirement to implement these interventions, as only 26% of our participants
were classified as very sedentary before hospitalization
according to the results of the Yale Physical Activity Survey.
And, while high physical activity has shown to be achievable


-----

with both low and high exercise capacity, Hornikk et al.
showed[15] that patients with poor exercise capacity and
very low physical activity might not be good candidates.
Thus, our trial design (i.e., inpatient early exercise training)
and inclusion criteria (i.e., less than one hospitalization in
the previous year) were set to overcome those barriers and
improve the efficacy of our intervention. Indeed, our results
highlight that a properly selected population might be a key
element for the success of this kind of interventions.
The improvement seen in steps/day in the IG is supported by some key elements of our study. First, we
objectively measured physical activity with a valid accelerometer[19,20] and patients were blind to the purpose of the
device. Second, the recruitment time comprised all year
round, and thus, a possible climate bias is null. Lastly, the
assessor responsible for measuring all the study outcomes
was blinded to patient allocation, thereby reducing the risk
of detection bias.
Nonetheless, we acknowledge some limitations. The
sample size was calculated to detect a significant difference
in steps/day between groups, which might have limited our
ability to detect further differences. For example, we
observed a between-group difference of 16 min in walking
time along with �3.2 points difference in the CAT questionnaire that did not reached statistical significance but it is
above the MCID[40] (Table 2).
In addition, we cannot ensure that the improvement in
physical activity observed with our intervention would be
maintained over time, as the data presented here only
describe the effect of a 12-week program. Yet, one of the
main objectives of the motivational interview is to favour
patients’ decisions to carry out a healthier lifestyle in search
of a long-lasting behaviour change.[41,42] Lastly, our results
might only apply to a COPD population such as ours, that
seems to be more active after hospital discharge than that
observed in other studies.[8,35,36] However, Donaire-Gonzalez
et al.[43] showed that COPD patients with previous hospitalizations in our geographical area walk similar number of
steps and de Oliveira et al.[44] have also recently reported very
similar data in Brazilian COPD patients after hospital
discharge.
In conclusion, we found that a 12-week patient-tailored,
pedometer-based, progressive and target-driven program
increased daily physical activity, specifically steps per day, in
selected patients with COPD following hospitalization for
an exacerbation of their disease. Further studies are needed
to confirm these results and to clarify if additional benefits
can be derived from such programs.
