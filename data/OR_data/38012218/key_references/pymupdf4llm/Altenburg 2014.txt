Summary
Background: We were interested in the effects of a physical activity (PA) counselling programme in three groups of COPD patients from general practice (primary care), outpatient
clinic (secondary care) and pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).
Methods: In this randomized controlled trial 155 COPD patients, 102 males, median (IQR) age
62 (54e69) y, FEV1predicted 60 (40e75) % were assigned to a 12-weeks’ physical activity counselling programme or usual care. Physical activity (pedometer (Yamax SW200) and metabolic
equivalents), exercise capacity (6-min walking distance) and quality of life (Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire and Clinical COPD Questionnaire) were assessed at baseline, after three
and 15 months.
Results: A significant difference between the counselling and usual care group in daily steps
(803 steps, p Z 0.001) and daily physical activity (2214 steps þ equivalents, p Z 0.001)) from
0 to 3 months was found in the total group, as well as in the outpatient (1816 steps, 2616
steps þ equivalents, both p Z 0.007) and PR (758 steps, 2151 steps þ equivalents, both
p Z 0.03) subgroups. From 0 to 15 months no differences were found in physical activity. However, when patients with baseline physical activity>10,000 steps per day (n Z 8), who are

#### Introduction


already sufficiently active, were excluded, a significant long-term effect of the counselling
programme on daily physical activity existed in the total group (p Z 0.02). Differences in exercise capacity and quality of life were found only from 0 to 3 months, in the outpatient subgroup.
Conclusion: Our PA counselling programme effectively enhances PA level in COPD patients after three months. Sedentary patients at baseline still benefit after 15 months.

#### Methods


Patients with COPD in general show a less active lifestyle
than healthy subjects [1e6] which is already present in mild
disease [7]. Low physical activity levels are clinically relevant in COPD as they are associated with lower quality of
life [3], more frequent hospitalisations and higher mortality

[8]. A downward circle of dyspnoea induced physical inactivity and deconditioning is thought to be responsible for
developing psychosocial problems such as depression and
social isolation [9]. Up to now, several strategies have been
proposed to increase physical activity in COPD, such as
exercise training alone or in combination with a self management programme [10,11]. An alternative strategy to
improve physical activity levels might be to aim at
enhancing lifestyle physical activity instead of focussing on
exercise training.
The intensity level of lifestyle physical activities, such
as walking, gardening and housekeeping in general is
moderate, which makes it attractive for patients with
COPD with reduced ventilatory capacity, because vigorous
intensity often causes feelings of dyspnoea and muscle
fatigue. In this respect lifestyle physical activity is well
assessed using pedometers or more sophisticated activity
monitors, which can even be used as an intervention tool
for increasing daily physical activity, showing positive results at least in patients with diabetes type II [12e15].
Inspired by these studies, we developed a pedometerbased physical activity counselling programme using
cognitive behavioural strategies [16], aiming at enhancement and incorporation of physical activities of moderate
intensity in daily life. The counselling programme has been
studied in two pilot studies in two different COPD populations, namely patients from the outpatient clinic [17]
and patients following PR [18], and suggested an increase
in physical activity after 3 months in the counselling group
compared to usual care.
Our hypothesis for the current study is that the counselling programme will result in an increase in physical
activity in COPD patients, in the short as well as long term.
This hypothesis was tested in three groups of COPD patients: patients from general practices (primary care),
outpatient clinics (secondary care), and patients following
a PR programme. In the last group, the counselling programme was additional to the conventional pulmonary
rehabilitation programme.


##### Study design

The study design was randomized and controlled, as patients were assigned to a physical activity counselling programme or usual care. Randomization was computerized
and patients were allocated to counselling or usual care
group in a 1:1 ratio, with minimization for age (<60/�60
years), FEV1 (<50/�50% predicted) and sex (male/female).
Allocation was open to the researcher, counsellor and patient. Patients were recruited from general practices (primary care), outpatient hospital clinics (secondary care) and
a pulmonary rehabilitation centre (PR), all in the
Netherlands, from 2007 till 2009. The last follow-up measurement was performed in December 2010. The study was
approved by the medical ethical committee of the University Medical Center Groningen and all participating patients
signed a written informed consent form. The trial was
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov: registration number
NCT00614796.

##### Subjects

Inclusion criteria were COPD according to the GOLD
Guidelines and age between 40 and 80 years. Excluded
were patients with comorbidities which severely limited
physical activity, such as severe orthopaedic or neurological disorders or heart failure or having exacerbations or
respiratory tract infections within two months prior to the
study.

##### Intervention

Patients in the counselling group participated in a 12weeks’ customized lifestyle physical activity counselling
programme designed to enhance physical activity in COPD
patients, which is described in more detail elsewhere

[17,18]. Lifestyle physical activity in our study comprised
all activities in daily life, including leisure time, occupational and household activity. Patients were free to choose
type, time point and location of activity to enhance their
physical activity level. Patients received the physical activity counselling programme in addition to usual care. Two
trained exercise counsellors performed all counselling. The


-----

individual counselling was predominantly based on principles of goal-setting and implementation of goals [16] and
motivational interviewing techniques were used. Patients
wore a pedometer all day during the intervention period,
which was used for feedback and motivation. A diary was
kept with steps taken and activities other than steps (e.g.
cycling, swimming etc.) were noted as well. Patients in the
counselling group attended 5 individual 30 min counselling
sessions spread over 3 months. Counselling took place in
the setting where patients were recruited. The usual care
group received care appropriate to their health status. For
the PR group usual care included a multidisciplinary PR
programme, which consisted of 9 weeks of exercise
training, 3 sessions a week, with a duration of 1e2 h per
session. Training forms used to achieve increased exercise
capacity were cycling, walking, swimming and sports. In
addition, patients followed educational courses and
received psychological and/or nutritional support if
necessary.

##### Measurements

All measurements took place prior to the intervention
(baseline), at the end of the intervention (3 months after
baseline) and 15 months after baseline. In the PR group
baseline meant prior to the intervention and prior to PR, as
the physical activity counselling started together with PR.
Lung function and bio-impedance were measured at baseline and 15 months after baseline.

##### Primary outcome measures

Physical activity was assessed in all patients in daily steps
using a pedometer (Digiwalker SW-2000, Yamax; Tokyo
Japan) and in daily physical activity [19]. The Compendium
of physical activities of Ainsworth et al. was used to
calculate metabolic equivalents for cycling, (cardio)fitness
and swimming [20,21]. A step equivalent is defined as the
physical activity with the energy expenditure of one step.
At each measurement point patients from the counselling
as well as the usual care group wore a pedometer during
two weeks, from waking up until going to bed, and recorded
number of steps per day and other activities (minutes per
day) in a diary. The mean of the last week of steps was used
for further analysis. Data were only used when at least 5
days of 7 were filled out.

##### Secondary outcome measures

Spirometry was performed according to standardized
guidelines (Jaeger MS-IOS). Fat free mass was measured
with bioelectrical impedance analysis (Bodystat 1500) [22].
Patients performed a 6-min walking distance (6MWD) test to
measure submaximal exercise capacity [23]. General health
status was assessed by the Short Form 36 (SF-36) and disease specific health status by the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) and the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire
(CRQ) [24e26]. Fatigue was assessed by the Dutch Exertion
and Fatigue Scale (DEFS) [27]. Anxiety and depression were
assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS) [28]. Self-efficacy was assessed by the Perceived


Physical Ability Subscale (PPAS, Dutch version) (10 items) of
the physical self-efficacy scale [29]. Intrinsic motivation for
physical activity was assessed by the Self Regulation
Questionnaire for Exercise (SRQ-E) [30].

##### Statistical analyses

Characteristics are shown as median (IQR) due to nonnormal distribution of outcome variables. Sample size calculations for this two-armed study were based on changes
in steps found in one of our pilot studies using an increase
of 2000 steps/day (SD 4017 steps/day) [17]. To have a twosided significance of p < 0.05 at a power of b Z 0.80 130
patients were needed. To compensate for expected
dropout 20% extra patients were included. Because of nonnormality of data, differences between counselling and
usual care group were tested with a ManneWhitney U test
for 0 to 3 months and 0 to 15 months for the total group and
subsequently for the three healthcare settings separately.
To assess the associations between the different
outcome measures Spearman’s correlations were calculated between change scores of daily steps, daily physical
activity, 6MWD, CRQ and CCQ in the counselling group.
All statistical analyses were performed using Scientific
Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18.0. P-values
<0.05 were considered to be significant.

#### Results

In total 173 patients were screened and 155 were randomized. A detailed flow diagram of the study is shown in
Figure 1, including information on reasons of dropout. The
dropout rate from the counselling group (29.9%) did not
differ significantly from that in the usual care group
(27.6%). Baseline characteristics of the total group and the
three subgroups are shown in Table 1. Patients in the PR
group were significantly younger, less physically active, had
a higher RV%TLC, and had worse sumscore on the CRQ than
patients in the primary care or secondary care group.
Additionally, all the groups differed from each other in
FEV1% predicted, FEV1% FVC, 6MWD and CCQ sumscore.
Table 2 shows the characteristics of the counselling and
usual care group at different measurement points.

##### Effects of physical activity counselling programme

Primary outcomes
The changes in daily steps and daily physical activity, from
0 to 3 months and 0 to 15 months are presented in Table 3
and Figures 2 and 3. Daily steps and daily physical activity
significantly increased after 3 months in the counselling
group compared to usual care; subgroup analysis showed
significant changes in the secondary care and PR groups.
After 15 months a trend for increased physical activity level
(p Z 0.062) was found in the total group but not in the
subgroups. When we excluded patients with a baseline daily
steps level >10,000/day, who can be considered to be
sufficiently active already, a significant long-term difference in daily physical activity, between counselling and
usual care in the total group could indeed be demonstrated
(p Z 0.017) (online Table 1).

Secondary outcomes
Overall, no significant changes in secondary outcome variables were found except for the improvements in 6MWD
(p Z 0.049) and CRQ sumscore (p Z 0.006) after 3 months
in the secondary care group (online Table 2).
There were no significant correlations between changes
in physical activity (daily steps and daily physical activity)
and changes in 6MWD, CRQ, CCQ, neither for the total
group (see online Table 3), nor for the subgroups.


#### Discussion

This study demonstrates that the physical activity counselling programme effectively increased daily step count
and daily physical activity after 3 months compared to
usual care. The median difference between counselling and
usual care was 803 steps (13% increase in the counselling
group, 4% decrease in usual care), and 2214 step equivalents, (22% increase in the counselling group, 12% decrease

in usual care). A trend for increased daily physical activity
after 15 months was found in the total group (p Z 0.062);
when patients with a baseline daily steps level >10,000/
day, who can be considered to be sufficiently physically
active already, were excluded, the long-term effect of the
counselling on daily physical activity was statistically significant indeed. No effect was shown on exercise capacity
and quality of life except for the change in 6MWD and CRQ
scores after 3 months in the secondary care group. This
group benefitted most as it showed the largest improvements (1816 daily steps and 2616 steps step equivalents).
þ
Dropout rates were rather high, but did not differ from
dropout from usual care.
Physical activity counselling studies have demonstrated
positive results in other disease populations [31e35]. Content and duration of the interventions differed, which may
explain differences in effectiveness. Fibromyalgia patients
were stimulated to achieve 30 min of moderate-intensity
activity per day and reported a decrease in perceived
functional deficits and pain and an increase in physical
activity after 12 weeks that could not be maintained after 6
and 12 months [31]. A pedometer-based telephone intervention of 6 weeks in cardiac patients resulted in an increase in physical activity, which was still present after 6
months [35]. It is generally acknowledged that behavioural
change programmes are more likely to succeed when the
intervention period is longer than 6 months. The Stages of
Change model suggests that a person, who tries to change
behaviour, should start and stay in the ‘action’ phase for
about six months before entering the ‘maintenance’ phase

[36]. Two recent studies with longer intervention periods


indeed showed sustained effects. A home-based programme of 11 months aimed at integrating physical activity
into daily routine supported by telephone calls compared to
regular supervised exercise training and a control group of
sedentary older subjects [33]. The lifestyle intervention
group in this study showed improvements in physical activity, functional performance and cardiorespiratory
fitness, directly after the intervention which were maintained after 12 months [33,34]. A 24 weeks’ pedometerbased intervention in diabetes type 2 patients resulted in
an increased activity pattern, which was maintained after
one year [32]. In COPD a six months period of PR was
necessary to increase physical activity, although three
months of rehabilitation was sufficient to improve exercise
capacity and quality of life [37]. This also suggests that
longer intervention periods are needed to improve physical
activity in COPD patients.
In our study, significant changes in physical activity level
between counselling and usual care group were shown in
the secondary care group and the PR group, whereas no
significant change was found in the primary care group. We
suggest that this difference is caused by differences in
severity of disease between these three groups. A number
of behavioural change theories, like the Health Belief
Model, the Self Determination Theory and the Goal Setting
theory, suggest that individuals are only motivated to
change behaviour, when they fear health consequences of
an unhealthy lifestyle or expect benefits of behavioural
change [38e40]. Patients with less severe disease, such as
those in the primary care group, suffer less from their
disease and it may therefore be less likely that they change

their activity pattern. In addition these patients generally
had already higher baseline physical activity levels, leaving
less room for improvement than in patients with more severe disease, indicating that interventions aiming at physical activity are probably more beneficial in patients with
more severe disease.
The effects of the physical activity counselling programme on physical activity were not well maintained after
15 months, though a clear trend was shown (p Z 0.062)
towards positive effects. In line with that, when excluding
patients with a baseline step level >10,000, who can be

considered as sufficiently active already, a significant longterm change in the counselling group compared to usual
care was found. Our suggestion for the PR group that improvements in exercise capacity and muscle function,
induced by PR, could be maintained in presence of a more
active lifestyle after PR, was not proven. Our interpretation
of these findings is that patients in the PR group had more
severe COPD, making them more frail and susceptible to
exacerbations greatly influencing their physical activity
level. The high number of dropouts (45% from the counselling arm of the study) in the PR group supports this
explanation, but also hinders firm conclusions. For the

secondary care group long-term results were somewhat
better but not significant. Apparently, maintaining an
active lifestyle is much more challenging than starting it.
Our physical activity counselling programme had only
limited effect on secondary outcomes, like the improvement of 6MWD and CRQ score in the secondary care group
after 3 months. This may off course be due to type 1 errors,
as this study was powered to detect relevant change in
steps and not in quality of life or exercise capacity. However some other explanations are possible. In the primary
care setting this absence of effect may be due to a higher
baseline physical activity level, CRQ sumscore and 6MWD
(95% of predicted) in these patients, which leaves not much
room for improvement. On the other hand, in the PR group,
both treatment arms received physical training and psychosocial education, which may have limited the additional
benefits of our physical activity counselling programme on
exercise capacity and quality of life. In general, an increase
in physical activity might not easily be translated into
additional improvements in quality of life and exercise
capacity, which is supported by the weak and nonsignificant correlations between both in our study. On the
other hand, exercising on moderate intensity, the intensity
of most lifestyle physical activity, for 15 min/day or 90 min/
week already reduces all cause mortality with 14% and
increased life expectancy with 3 years in the general population [41]. Every additional increase of 15 min of physical
activity beyond this minimum of 15 min/day further
reduced all cause mortality by 4%. Thus, the relationships
between PA on the one hand, and quality of life, physical
fitness and mortality on the other hand are not fully
elucidated and further studies in the general population as
well as in COPD are definitely needed.
Our study design has particular strengths and weaknesses. A strong point is that a broad range of COPD patients was included, with three well-defined subgroups,
which enables generalization of outcomes. Another strong
point is that not only short-term but also long-term effects
of a physical activity counselling programme in COPD were
studied: the absence of significant long-term effects emphasizes the need for developing interventions for maintenance of beneficial effects of counselling such as in the
present study. And finally the tool for intervention and
measurement of the primary outcome variable, physical
activity, was the same namely the pedometer, which obtains actual values of walking, an important form of physical activity.
Some limitations should be mentioned. Firstly, the
pedometer we used does not measure non-ambulatory
physical activity like cycling or swimming. We chose to
calculate step equivalents from activities that could not be
measured by the pedometer and were noted in activity
diaries in minutes/day [20,42].
Secondly, usual care was not the same for all subgroups,
as patients in the PR group additionally received PR. As the
power calculation was based on a pilot study in which
counselling was the single treatment, the power for this
study would theoretically be lower. Despite this we found a
significant short-term effect of the counselling on physical
activity.
For clinical practice the results of our study show that
pedometer based counselling is a useful tool in the


treatment of COPD patients in various settings. It can be
used as a single treatment option in less severe COPD patients, but also be part of a regular PR programme, adjunct
to exercise training and other psychosocial interventions.
We suggest that more feedback moments over a longer
period could make the intervention more effective in the
long term. It has been demonstrated that adherence
counselling after PR leads to maintenance of increases of
daily activity, exercise adherence and exercise capacity
after 1 year [43]. Furthermore, we suggest that in primary
care patients should be selected more specifically for
having low baseline physical activity, low exercise capacity
and/or high motivation for physical activity.
In developing other physical activity counselling programmes modern tools for real time feedback may be used,
such as sound or visual signals from a pedometer, accelerometer or smartphone. The feasibility of using an accelerometer and pedometer integrated into a mobile phone to
support exercise training and physical activity has already
been investigated in cardiac patients and the effects will be
further investigated in a randomized controlled trial [44].
In conclusion, our study shows that a 12 weeks’ physical
activity counselling programme enhances physical activity
level in COPD patients in the short term, which is maintained at 15 months in patients with baseline daily step
count <10,000 steps per day. The effects were most
prominent in patients attending the outpatient clinic.
Physical activity counselling might be used in various
healthcare settings.
