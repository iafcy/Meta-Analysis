**Purpose:** This Stay Active after Rehabilitation (STAR) study examined the effects of
a pedometer-based behavioral intervention for individuals with COPD during three weeks
of inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) on patients’ physical activity levels six weeks and
six months after PR, including steps (primary outcome), moderate-intensity physical activity,
and sedentary time as well as patient quality of life, symptoms, and other psychological and
clinical variables.
**Patients and Methods: Rehabilitation patients with COPD wore a triaxial accelerometer**
(ActiGraph wGT3X) for seven days two weeks before (T0) as well as six weeks (T3) and six
months (T4) after PR. In addition to the three-week inpatient PR (control group, CG), the
randomly allocated intervention group (IG) received a brief pedometer-based behavioral
intervention with the application of the following behavior-change techniques: performing
the behavior, individual goal-setting, self-monitoring, and feedback. The effects were ana­
lyzed using analysis of covariance with an intention-to-treat approach.
**Results: A total of 327 patients (69% male, age: 58 years, FEV1 (%): 53.5, six-minute walk**
distance: 447.8 m) were randomly allocated to either the IG (n = 167) or CG (n = 160).
Although both groups increased their daily steps after PR (IG: MT3-T0 = 1152, CG: MT3-T0 =
745; IG: MT4-T0 = 795, CG: MT4-T0 = 300), the slightly higher increases in daily steps in the
IG compared to the CG at T3 (Δ388 steps, d = 0.16) and T4 (Δ458 steps, d = 0.15) were not
statistically significant (p > 0.05 for all). Patients in both groups showed moderate to high
pre-post-changes in terms of secondary outcomes, but no advantage favoring the IG was
found.
**Conclusion:** The results show that adding a pedometer-based behavioral intervention to
standard German three-week inpatient PR for COPD patients did not result in more physical
activity in terms of steps and moderate-intensity physical activity or less sedentary time.
However, both groups (IG and CG) showed remarkably enhanced physical activity levels six
weeks and six months after PR, as well as improvements in other secondary outcomes (eg,
quality of life).

## Plain Language Summary
Pulmonary rehabilitation programs aim to increase the physical activity levels in COPD
patients, as low physical activity is related to poor health outcomes (eg, higher mortality
rates). However, patients with COPD often find it difficult to stay physically active after
rehabilitation. This study examines whether adding a pedometer to German inpatient

rehabilitation programs helps COPD patients stay active after
completing the rehabilitation period. Pedometers are small, light­
weight, portable devices that measure the user’s number of steps;
pedometers are useful in providing feedback to the user on
activity levels and they help users set daily goals for being
physically active (eg, 10,000 steps a day). In this study, all
COPD rehabilitants—those with pedometers and those without
pedometers—showed a significant increase both in their daily
steps and their moderate-intensity physical activity in the six
weeks and six months of follow-up. Adding the pedometer to
the three-week inpatient rehabilitation program did not result in
any additional physical activity six weeks or six months after the
rehabilitation program.

## Introduction
Physical activity (PA) plays a crucial role in the treatment
of non-communicable diseases,[1 ] especially in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Clinical evidence
demonstrates that, in COPD patients, PA leads to substan­
tial health effects, including increased exercise capacity,[2 ]

reduced dyspnoea,[3 ] improved quality of life,[4 ] and lower
mortality rates.[5 ] Nevertheless, patients with COPD often
show significantly reduced PA levels when compared to
healthy controls or even with other patients with noncommunicable diseases.[6 ] Accordingly, the promotion of
PA is a key therapeutic goal in COPD patients in general
and in pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).[7 ]PR provides proven
short-term benefits in terms of exercise capacity, dyspnea,
anxiety, depression, and quality of life;[8 ] although, in indi­
viduals with COPD, PR programs often fail to substan­
tially enhance long-term PA.[9][,][10 ] Therefore, for optimized
patient treatment during PR, effective strategies to
improve PA are needed.[10]

Despite a wide interest among scientists and practi­
tioners in interventions and strategies to promote PA in
COPD patients,[11][,][12 ] Burge et al[13 ] conclude that there is
limited evidence for improvements in PA resulting from
these strategies, which include exercise training, counsel­
ling, and pharmacological treatment. In general, the use of
a pedometer to monitor one’s PA is regarded as one of the
most effective intervention methods for promoting PA.[14 ]

Pedometers are small, lightweight, portable devices that
measure the user’s number of steps; they are particularly
effective when combined with specific behavior change
techniques (BCTs), such as documenting one’s PA beha­
vior, setting PA goals, and monitoring PA changes.[15–17 ] In
a recent meta-analysis specific to COPD patients, ped­
ometer-based interventions achieved similar PA promotion


effects when used either as stand-alone interventions or in
addition to PR.[16 ] Adding pedometers to PR resulted in
heterogeneous effects, with an average PA increase of
approximately 2,050 steps per day, whereas standard PR
achieved only a small PA increase of approximately 300
steps per day (d = 0.51).[16 ] All seven primary studies
included in this review were conducted in the setting of
outpatient rehabilitation. This means that the patients were
not hospitalized overnight but visited a hospital, clinic, or
associated facility for treatment, and rehabilitation was
applied over a relatively long duration (8–52 weeks). In
contrast, in Germany, PR is usually delivered as an inpa­
tient treatment, which means that patients stay overnight in
a specialized rehabilitation clinic for a significantly shorter
intervention period (three to four weeks) where they
receive lodging, food, and treatment.[18 ] To date, no find­
ings are available on the long-term effects on COPD
patients’ PA behavior after the application of pedometerbased interventions during German inpatient PR.

## Purpose of This Study and Hypothesis
The overarching goal of the Stay Active after
Rehabilitation (STAR) study (Trial Registry:
Clinicaltrials.gov; ID: NCT02966561) was to gain
a better understanding of PA in patients with COPD before
and after PR.[19 ] The pre-specified main research question
examined whether the integration of a pedometer-based
intervention in inpatient PR for COPD patients leads to
a sustained improvement in PA levels six weeks and six
months after PR.[19 ] Our primary hypothesis was that, in
patients with COPD, inpatient PR (standard rehabilitation
in Germany) along with a pedometer-based behaviorchange intervention would result in significantly higher
PA levels (eg, a greater number of steps, more moderateintensity PA, less sedentary time) six weeks and six
months after rehabilitation when compared with inpatient
PR along with an equal duration of PA-related patient
education.

## Materials and Methods
The STAR study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki, and all subjects provided written
informed consent. The ethics commission of the
University of Erlangen-Nürnberg approved the study in
2015 (Re. No. 321_15B). The study protocol was regis­
tered at Clinicaltrials.gov in November 2016 (ID:
NCT02966561) and published in 2017.[19]

## Study Design and Treatments
The STAR study took place within the German rehabilita­
tion system. In Germany, all insured persons can apply for
rehabilitation. Taking into account the assessment of the
individuals’ general practitioner, an expert decided
whether this application could be approved. The approved
measures are usually carried out through an three-week
inpatient rehabilitation program at a specialized clinic.

The study used a single-center, randomized controlled
trial (RCT) design with two parallel groups and five mea­
surement points: T0 = two weeks before the start of
rehabilitation, T1 = the start of rehabilitation, T2 = the
end of rehabilitation, T3 = six weeks after rehabilitation,
and T4 = six months after rehabilitation.

All of the study participants in both the intervention
group (IG) and control group (CG) received an intensive,
interprofessional three-week inpatient PR (standard care;
see the study protocol for details on the intervention
components).[19 ] This rehabilitation program followed cur­
rent international and national guidelines for the diagnosis,
therapy, and rehabilitation of COPD patients.[7][,][20 ] In addi­
tion to the standard rehabilitation program, the IG received
a pedometer-based PA promotion intervention (two 45minute sessions), while the CG received a revision of
PA-related patient education of an equal duration with no
pedometer. For both groups, the first lesson was situated at
the end of the second week of PR, and the second lesson
took place in the middle of the third week. At the begin­
ning of their PR, the IG participants received a pedometer,
which they were advised to wear throughout the PR and
take home afterward. The intervention for the IG used the
following behavior change techniques (BCTs), which are
numbered according to Michie et al[21 ] shaping knowledge
(instructions on how to perform the behavior [4.1]), goals
and planning (individual goal-setting for PA behavior

[1.1]), feedback and monitoring (self-monitoring of one’s
PA behavior using a pedometer [2.3] and documentation of
one’s PA in a diary [2.3]), and feedback on PA behavior
(2.2) during PR. The detailed procedure of the IG beha­
vioral intervention is described in [Supplementary Table](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=304976.docx)
[S6. Only the CG received repeated information regarding](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=304976.docx)
PA during patient education sessions and warm-up
exercises.

Patients were assigned to the two arms after T0 using
a central random allocation sequence. The randomization,
which drew on a randomization list provided externally by
researchers at the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg, was


carried out by a study assistant after the initial medical
examination. The block size for the randomization was six
participants per block. The randomization was stratified
according to the four prognostic dichotomous variables
(gender: male vs female; COPD stage: GOLD stage 1–2
vs stage 3–4; age: < 60 years vs ≥ 60 years; and type of
rehabilitation: PR in patients with stable COPD vs PR
after acute care hospitalization due to COPD).

The participants were blinded in relation to the study
group allocations. They were informed that the effective­
ness of the two exercise therapy programs was compared,
that both programs met the current scientific standards,
and that they were suitable for improving the health status
of COPD patients. Blinding of the therapists was not
feasible due to their involvement in the same clinical
rehabilitation team.

#### Eligibility Criteria
We recruited COPD patients with an approved three-week
inpatient PR and an assignment to start their rehabilitation
at the Rehabilitation Clinic of Bad Reichenhall, Germany.
We included patients with COPD, that is, all GOLD symp­
toms and risk groups A–D or all COPD stages 1–4.[22 ] The
diagnosis of COPD, which had initially been made by
a medical practitioner in each patient’s hometown, was
confirmed by a pulmonologist from the rehabilitation
clinic at the start of the PR; this confirmation included
a lung function test (Tiffeneau index FEV1/VC after shortacting beta agonists (SABA) ≤ 0.70).

The exclusion criteria included serious comorbidities,
for example, malignancies that were not curatively treated
or severe cardiac, orthopedic, or severe psychiatric comor­
bidities; a considerable reduction in vision or hearing; and
the inability to speak German. At the beginning of the PR,
the admitting physician checked the inclusion and exclu­
sion criteria.

## Outcomes and Assessments
The primary outcome was the difference in the number of
objectively measured daily steps between the IG and CG at
T4. The secondary outcomes related to PA were the differ­
ences between groups in steps at T3, as well as moderateintensity PA and sedentary time at T3 and T4. Furthermore,
differences between IG and CG in terms of other secondary
outcomes (see below) were also examined. In addition,
changes in all outcomes from T0 to T3 and T4 (or T1 to
T2 and T4) were examined in both groups.


-----

For all three measurement points, the PA of the patients
was measured on seven consecutive days using the vali­
dated tri-axial accelerometer ActiGraph (Pensacola,
Florida) wGT3X-BT, which is explicitly recommended
for COPD.[23–25 ] Based on the raw accelerometer output,
we calculated the number of participants’ daily steps, the
amount of time spent in moderate-intensity PA, and the
amount of time spent sedentary. The detailed method used
for validating and processing the accelerometers’ raw data
and calculating light-intensity and moderate-intensity PA
was described previously.[26]

In addition, the following secondary outcomes were
assessed: quality of life via the Saint George’s
Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)[27 ] and the COPD
Assessment Test (CAT),[28 ] depression using the Patient
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9),[29 ] COPD-related
anxiety,[30 ] fear avoidance in COPD[31 ] and dyspnea (numer­
ical rating scale).[19][,][32 ] Furthermore, demographic charac­
teristics (eg, sex, age, height, weight, and work-status), 6
Minute Walk Distance (6MWD),[33 ] acute exacerbations of
COPD (AECOPD), smoking status, diagnosis and co-mor­
bidities assessed at T1 will be reported.

## Statistical Analysis
Sample size calculations with dropout rate estimates
revealed that 502 patients needed to be recruited to pro­
vide 351 patients; this number of patients will statistically
support a small effect size of d = 0.3 with an alpha error of
5% and a power of 80%.[19 ] To analyze the differences
between the IG and CG at T3 and T4, we performed
multiple analyses of covariances (ANCOVAs) for each
outcome and measurement occasion (T3, T4) separately.
Group assignment (IG vs CG) was included as a predictor
variable, and gender, age, progression of COPD (GOLD
stage 1–2 vs stage 3–4), type of rehabilitation (PR in
patients with stable COPD vs PR after hospitalization),
and the baseline value of the respective outcomes were
included as covariates. The adjusted mean differences
(AMD), including a 95% confidence interval and the
effect size Cohen’s d, were also reported.[34 ]We had exam­
ined the distributions of the residuals (after ANCOVA)
graphically with respect to violations of the normal dis­
tribution, violations of heteroscedasticity, and the influ­
ence of outliers.

In addition, the mean values (M) and standard devia­
tions (SD) for the IG and CG were reported for all mea­
surement points. To estimate the changes during PR, the
mean changes between the baseline and T3 or T4 (or


between T1 and T2/T4) and the standardized effect size
(SES) were reported.[35 ] To calculate the SES, the mean
change values were divided by the SD of the baseline
values. The values of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 for the standardized
measures (Cohen’s d, SES) were rated as low, medium,
and high, respectively.[34]

We included all randomized participants in the ana­
lyses (employing intention-to-treat analysis). To deal with
missing data, we used multiple imputation[36 ]to generate 10
complete data sets. The pooled results are reported. For the
multiple imputation, we used the MICE[37 ]R package. In all
of the analyses, the alpha level was set at 5%. Data
management was performed in IBM SPSS version 25,
[while the statistical environment R (http://www.r-project.](http://www.r-project.org/index.html)
[org/index.html) was used to conduct the statistical](http://www.r-project.org/index.html)
analyses.

## Results Participant Flow
We recruited 418 patients who were initially diagnosed
with COPD by a general practitioner; 63 patients had to
be excluded because their COPD diagnosis could not be
confirmed by a lung function test (Tiffeneau index FEV1/
VC not ≤ 0.70), which was regularly performed at the
beginning of the PR.

At randomization, the STAR study comprised 327
COPD patients at T1 (IG = 167, CG = 160) with a mean
age of 58.02 ± 5.43 years; 226 (69%) patients were male.
Participants were recruited between June 2016 and
June 2018, and follow-up was finished in December 2019.
The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the
IG and the CG are displayed in Table 1. Figure 1 shows the
CONSORT flowchart for the study participants.[38]

## Physical Activity: Steps (Primary Outcome), Moderate-Intensity Physical Activity, and Sedentary Time
#### Changes from T0 to T3/T4
Both the IG and the CG showed a significant increase in
daily steps and moderate-intensity PA from T0 to T3. The
mean changes from T0 to T3 were slightly higher for both
outcomes in the IG (+1153 steps; +8.0 min moderate-inten­
sity PA) than in the CG (+745 steps; +4.3 min moderateintensity PA). The results and patterns for the step changes
from T0 to T4 are quite similar (IG: +795; CG: +299) to
those from T0 to T3 while the moderate-intensity PA levels
at T4 are almost similar to the T0 baseline values. Both

groups showed small reductions in their daily sedentary time
from the baseline to T3 (IG: −12.1 min; CG: −17.1 min) and
T4 (IG: −12.2 min; CG: −10.9 min) (see Table 2 and
Figure 2).

#### Differences Between IG/CG at T3/T4
Descriptively, the IG showed higher mean values than the
CG in terms of steps and moderate-intensity PA at T3 and T4
(see Table 3). However, none of these differences (steps in
the IG compared to the CG at T3: AMD = 388 steps, d = 0.16
and T4: AMD = 458 steps, d = 0.15; moderate-intensity PA at
T3: AMD = 3.5 min, d = 0.17 and T4: AMD = 3.0 min, d =
0.14) were statistically significant (p > 0.05 for all).
Additionally, the differences between the IG and CG for
sedentary time at T3 (AMD = 6.3 min, _d_ = 0.08) and T4
(Δ0.1 min, d = 0.00) were also not statistically significant.

#### Other Secondary Outcomes
Both groups showed a medium-to-high improvement in terms
of health-related quality of life (SGRQ total) from T0 to T3
(IG: −14.6; CG: −16.7), and medium improvement from T0


to T4 (IG: −11.2; CG: −13.4). Similar to the PA-related out­
comes, IG and CG showed no significant differences in terms
of quality of life at T3 (AMD = 0.51, d = 0.03) and T4 (AMD
= 0.65, _d_ = 0.04). In addition to the SGRQ total score,
[Supplementary Table S1 includes the SGRQ domains.](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=304976.docx)

The other secondary outcomes (eg, CAT, COPDrelated anxiety, fear avoidance in COPD, PHQ-9) showed
similar patterns: improved values from T0 to T3 and from
T0 to T4 with no differences between CG and IG at both
[follow-ups (see Supplementary Tables S1-S5).](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=304976.docx)

## Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, the current STAR study is the
first to examine the long-term effects of the addition of
a pedometer-based intervention to German inpatient PR on
COPD patients’ PA levels six weeks and six months after PR.
In both trial groups, our RCT showed improved PA levels
(increased daily steps and moderate-intensity PA, less seden­
tary time) in COPD patients six weeks and six months after
three weeks of inpatient PR, which is standard in Germany.

However, contrary to our primary hypothesis, the addition of
a brief pedometer-based behavioral intervention to PR did
not result in additional improvements in PA (measured in
daily steps, moderate-intensity PA, and sedentary time).


## Comparison with Other Studies
Compared to other studies, the pedometer intervention in

A review from Armstrong et al[16 ] identified seven studies
from which six found an additional PA-enhancing effect
for a pedometer intervention in the context of outpatient
PR, and reported increases of between 680 and 2,600
steps. Our IG increased their PA volume when compared
to the CG by only 388 steps (statistically insignificant) at
the six-week follow-up and 458 steps at the six-month
follow-up. Descriptively, the IG performed a greater num­
ber of steps and more time in moderate-intensity PA postPR, but the effects were smaller (dT3 = 0.15; _dT4_ = 0.16)
than initially assumed (d = 0.30) and smaller than reported
in international studies (d = 0.51).[16 ] The descriptive
effects of the pedometer-based intervention on sedentary
time were even smaller and were also statistically insig­
nificant. These results may have several causes.

First, we had a challenging CG that also received a
revision of PA-related patient education along with stan­
dard inpatient PR, which is an intensive, interprofessional,
and guideline-based intervention in a specialized rehabili­
tation clinic.[39 ] In Germany, the current practice of three
weeks’ for inpatient PR (with the possibility to request an
extension, if necessary) is based on individual initial
assessments that culminate in a combination of patienttailored therapies totaling more than 20 hours per week.
The PR program is implemented by an interdisciplinary
rehabilitation team and includes several interventional
components that also address the promotion of PA (see
the study protocol[19 ] for program details). This means the
quality of this program, in terms of PA promotion, is
already high. Within German rehabilitation, around half
of the exercise therapy departments emphasize PA
promotion.[40 ] The cooperating clinic for this study is one
such clinic, which means that the exercise/physical


therapists are very familiar with the concept of behavioral
exercise therapy[41 ] and thus apply BCTs; this includes
instructions on how to perform PA behavior after PR
(see study protocol; Additional File 1).[19 ] PA changes in
COPD patients after PR without pedometers (=usual care)
in other studies show an average increase of 250 steps
per day.[16 ] Compared to this, our results revealed that the
three-week inpatient PR program employed in the STAR
study (with and without pedometers) was associated with
substantially greater increases in PA after PR. Other stu­
dies of mostly outpatient PR without additional ped­
ometers showed effects between −187 and +892 steps.[16 ]

With an increase at T3 of 797 steps for the non-pedometer
group and 1,107 for the pedometer group, the pre-post
changes in the STAR study lie above most of the prepost changes reported in other studies, most of which
had shorter follow-ups.

Second, the pedometer-based intervention in the IG
may have been too short in terms of duration. The two
45-minute sessions may have been insufficiently long for
some COPD patients to ensure the effective use of the
pedometers and the PA diary, which is where patients
recorded and monitored their daily steps after PR.

Third, it could be that the high baseline PA levels in
our two groups (>5800 steps per day) reduced the effec­
tiveness of the intervention and that the pedometer-based
interventions would have been more successful when
applied to individuals with a lower baseline PA level.

We decided to report the secondary outcome quality of
life for two reasons. First, quality of life plays a prominent
role for patients with COPD, and second, we were able to
show in a previous analysis of the STAR data that quality
of life is directly related to physical activity.[42 ] The


-----

descriptive effects of the pedometer-based intervention on
quality of life were even smaller and statistically insignif­
icant. However, the improvement in both groups (IG and
CG) indicates a positive effect of the PR program here as
well.

In summary, the high-quality standard rehabilitation
program employed for both the IG and the CG led to
a considerable PA-promoting effect, which was difficult
to increase via the—perhaps too short—pedometer
intervention.

## Strengths and Limitations
Our study has several strengths. The design of the STAR
study is suitable for overcoming restrictions in previous
empirical findings, as it features PA after PR as the pri­
mary outcome, includes an appropriately powered sample
size, employs objective measures of PA and a long-term
follow-up, and collects baseline PA data before PR.

Nevertheless, this study has some limitations. First,
the effective sample size at T4 (n = 288) was slightly
smaller than the pre-calculated number (n = 351).
However, irrespective of the fact that the study false
inclusion rate (due to initial misdiagnosis by the general
practitioners) and dropout rate were higher than expected,
the effects found were also significantly smaller than
hypothesized,[19 ] meaning that even a slightly larger sam­
ple would probably not have led to different conclusions.
Second, even though the use of accelerometers has been
acknowledged as a high scientific standard, and due to
the fact that this study followed recent data-processing
recommendations, accelerometry has some restrictions:
water-based activities (eg, swimming) were not recorded,
the valid daily wear time of accelerometers of at least 10
hours did not cover the entire day, and the method of
accelerometry under-detected non-ambulatory PA (eg,
exercise of the upper limbs). Third, only 418 of the 797
individuals contacted were willing to participate. The
included participants may represent those with a greater
interest in PA. Fourth, the study population differs from
most other COPD populations by having a relatively
young average age of only 58 years. Moreover, these
patients were recruited from a single country and, impor­
tantly, from a single clinic with a specific—though typi­
cal for Germany—inpatient setting, which reduces the
generalizability of the present findings. Fifth, as the IG
and CG received their PR at the same clinic, it cannot be
ruled out that the two groups exchanged information on


pedometers with a possible unblinding effect regarding
study group allocation.

## Implications and Future Research
Our results suggest that the addition of a brief pedometerbased intervention does not substantially enhance the longterm PA-promoting effect of inpatient PR in COPD and
should therefore not be implemented into the clinical
practice of PR in this brief duration.

To improve the PA-promoting effect of pedometerbased interventions in COPD patients, it appears that
longer intervention periods are more promising. Longer
intervention periods are especially helpful to form the
users’ habits regarding their use of the pedometer and
self-controlling daily activity levels based on the ped­
ometer-measured steps, and the entry of those steps into
their PA diary, which may facilitate realistic PA-related
goal setting in a next step.

Our study detected significant increases in PA levels
following PR; however, not all patients showed better
PA levels at T3, and not all patients with increased PA
levels at T3 could maintain these improvements at T4.
In addition, the large 95% confidence intervals for the
PA changes indicate high interpersonal heterogeneity.
Therefore, future research should identify responders
and non-responders regarding PA improvements and
accurately describe them using important disease-related
(eg, disease severity) and behavioral criteria (eg, stage
of change).[43 ] Furthermore, sub-group analyses should
identify those with initial PA improvements and declines
in PA levels in the long term. These analyses could
profit from a simultaneous consideration of diseaserelated parameters (eg, exercise capacity)[44 ] and impor­
tant psychological determinants of PA (motivation, selfregulation; see for example Geidl et al).[41 ] Such findings
could lead to a better understanding of PA changes in
COPD patients and support the development of tailored
PA promotion strategies.

Even the physically active participants in our study had
very long sedentary times prior to the PR,[26 ]and our results
showed that PR did not substantially affect this behavior.
This result supports previous research that demonstrated
that interventions to promote PA and reduce sedentary
time do not follow the same logic; rather, each must be
addressed specifically.[45 ] Currently, the topic of sedentar­
ism is only barely considered in clinical guidelines.[46 ]

Given that sedentary time in COPD is an independent
predictor of poor prognosis[47 ] and mortality,[48 ] future


-----

clinical guidelines and PR programs should not only
address PA promotion but also the reduction in sedentary
time.

## Conclusion
The results of this RCT indicate that the addition of a brief
pedometer-based behavioral intervention to inpatient PR
did not result in more PA in terms of steps and moderateintensity PA or less sedentary time six weeks and six
months after PR. The intervention also had no additional
effect on other secondary outcomes, such as quality of life.
Nevertheless, both groups of COPD patients, the IG and
CG, showed remarkably enhanced PA levels and other
secondary outcomes six weeks and six months following
standard German inpatient PR.
