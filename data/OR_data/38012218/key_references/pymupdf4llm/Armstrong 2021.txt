_Aims and objectives: The Clinical PROactive Physical Activity in COPD (C-PPAC) instrument, combines a ques­_
tionnaire assessing the domains of amount and difficulty of physical activity (PA) with activity monitor data
(steps/day and vector magnitude units) to assess patients’ experiences of PA. The C-PPAC instrument is
responsive to pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions and to changes in clinically relevant
variables. We compared the effect of PA behavioural modification interventions alongside pulmonary rehabili­
tation (PR) to PR alone on the C-PPAC scores in COPD patients with low baseline PA levels.
_Methods: In this randomised controlled trial, 48 patients (means ± SD: FEV1: 50 ± 19%, baseline steps/day: 3450_
± 2342) were assigned 1:1 to receive PR alone, twice weekly for 8 weeks, or PA behavioural modification in­
terventions (comprising motivational interviews, monitoring and feedback using a pedometer and goal setting)
alongside PR (PR + PA). The C-PPAC instrument was used to assess PA experience, including a perspective of the
amount and difficulty of PA.
_Results: There were clinically important improvements in favour of the PR + PA interventions compared to PR_
alone in: 1) the C-PPAC total score (mean [95% CI] difference: 8 [4 to 12] points, p = 0.001), the difficulty (mean

[95% CI] difference: 8 [3 to 13] points, p = 0.002) and the amount (mean [95% CI] difference 8 [3 to 16] points,
_p = 0.005) domains and 2) the CAT score (mean [95% CI] difference: -2.1 [-3.8 to −_ 0.3] points, p = 0.025).
_Conclusion: PA behavioural modification interventions alongside PR improve the experiences of PA in patients_
with advanced COPD and low baseline PA levels. (NCT03749655).


Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) have
lower levels of daily physical activity (PA) than their healthy agematched peers [1–4]. It is recognised that reduced levels of PA in pa­
tients with COPD are associated with a faster rate of disease progression,
greater risk for exacerbation of COPD (ECOPD), leading to increased
rates of hospital admissions and mortality [5].
Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an integral non-pharmacological
component in COPD management [6]. However, while PR programs
improve exercise capacity and health-related quality of life in people
with COPD [6], these findings have not consistently progressed into
improvements in daily PA [7], particularly in patients with advanced


COPD and low baseline exercise capacity [8]. This is likely due to the
complexity of PA as a health behaviour in COPD [9], with those patients
exhibiting low baseline exercise capacity being less capable of
increasing their PA levels due to a low functional reserve [8].
PA behavioural modification interventions have been employed to
address the complex behaviour of PA, with the majority of previous
studies demonstrating promising results in patients with COPD [10–16].
This is accomplished by stimulating patients to increase their PA levels
by incorporating lifestyle activities into daily life in conjunction with
patient monitoring and feedback of their daily steps alongside
frequently adjusted goal setting [17]. A recently published systematic
review and meta-analysis [18] reported that pedometer-based PA
behavioural modification standalone interventions or alongside PR in

patients with COPD improved accelerometer derived steps per day by
clinically important margins [18,19]. However, in patients with
advanced COPD and low baseline PA levels, PA was less likely to
improve following PA behavioural modification interventions alongside
PR [18], especially in those with poor baseline exercise capacity [8,15,
16].
Studies investigating patients with advanced COPD and low baseline
exercise capacity and PA levels [8,15,16] have focused primarily on the
frequency, intensity, duration and type of PA, which are quantified by
means of activity monitors validated in patients with COPD [20]. This
method of assessment, however, fails to fully capture patients’ experi­
ences of PA [21]. Qualitative research has indicated that while patients
engage in daily physical activities, they experience symptoms which
adversely impact on their lifestyle [22]. Such patient centred concepts
are only quantifiable through a patient-reported outcome (PRO) ques­
tionnaire [23]. However, implementing a PRO questionnaire alone
removes the ability to assess the frequency, intensity and type of PA
objectively [21].


In order to combine these features, the Clinical PROactive physical
activity in COPD (C-PPAC) instrument was developed, and recently
validated in patients with COPD [21]. The instrument provides a
comprehensive measure of patients’ experiences of PA, merging sub­
jective questions regarding the amount and difficulty of PA alongside
objective measures of PA, encompassing average steps per day and
vector magnitude units (VMU), which refers to intensity rather than
quantity of PA [21]. The instrument measures amount of PA, difficulty
of PA and total PA experiences. A recent study [24] reported the effect of
PA behavioural modification interventions or PR alone on patients’
experiences of PA using the C-PPAC instrument, indicating clinically
important improvements. The effect of adding PA behavioural modifi­
cation interventions to PR as compared to PR alone on patient PA ex­
periences was, however, not reported in that study [24]. We, therefore,
evaluated the effect of PA behavioural modification interventions
alongside PR on the PA experiences of COPD patients with low baseline
PA and exercise capacity levels. It was hypothesised that PA behavioural
modification interventions including motivational interviewing, goal

setting, step count monitoring and feedback, alongside PR aiming to
improve functional capacity, would be superior to PR alone in
improving all dimensions of the C-PPAC instrument.

**2. Methods**

_2.1. Study design_

This is a single centre, two parallel-groups, randomised controlled
trial (RCT) with 1:1 individual allocation looking into patient compli­
ance to PA behavioural modification interventions alongside PR (PR +
PA) and its efficacy in comparison to PR alone in patients with COPD.
The design of the study and flow of patients is presented in Fig. 1. This
study complies with NIHR HRA requirements (Ref: 18/YH/0376) and
was prospectively registered at [clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov) online database
(NCT03749655).

_2.2. Participants_

Patients were recruited from Newcastle upon Tyne Foundation
Health Care Trust (NuTH) Chest Clinic and PR waiting lists. Respiratory
nurses and physiotherapists informed eligible patients about the study
and asked their willingness to participate in the study. Patients inclusion
criteria included: (i) COPD confirmed by obstructive spirometry (postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV1] to
forced vital capacity [FVC] ratio <0.70); (ii) clinically stable male or
female COPD patients aged 40 years or older; (iii) optimised medical
therapy; (iv) able to provide informed consent. Patients exclusion
criteria included: (i) orthopaedic, neurological or other concomitant
disease that significantly impaired normal biomechanical movement
patterns, as judged by the investigator; (ii) moderate or severe COPD
exacerbation (ECOPD) within 4 weeks prior to study enrolment; (iii)
unstable ischaemic heart disease, including myocardial infarction
within 6 weeks prior to study enrolment; (iv) moderate or severe aortic
stenosis or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy; (v) uncontrolled
hypertension and another condition likely to limit life expectancy to less
than one year (principally metastatic malignancy). Upon meeting the
study entry criteria, patients who agreed to participate were contacted
by the research team. Detailed information regarding the study was
provided and written informed consent was obtained prior to the study.

_2.3. Pulmonary rehabilitation_

The 8-week PR programme was delivered according to the BTS
guidelines on PR [25], comprising two 60-min sessions of exercise
training and one 30-min education session per week between November
2018 to November 2020. Due to the pandemic 6 patients (n = 3 in the PR
intervention and n = 3 in the PR + PA intervention) completed one
exercise session under supervision and one unsupervised at home. Each
supervised exercise session was delivered by a respiratory physiother­
apist and involved progressive, individualised tailored aerobic and
resistance training in accordance with the BTS guidelines on PR [25]. A
multidisciplinary team comprising physiotherapists, psychologists, di­
eticians, respiratory nurses and occupational therapists, delivered the
education component of the PR programme. As per the BTS guidelines
on PR [25], the educational component of PR aims to support aspects of
lifestyle and behaviour change and assist the promotion of
self-management to support patients decision making and self-efficacy.
Specific educational talks across the 8-week PR programme included
guidance and support on dyspnea/symptom management, chest clear­
ance/breathing techniques, nutritional advice, and advice on improving
PA. Regardless of group allocation in the study, generic advice on
improving PA was provided with an emphasis on barriers and facilita­
tors to improving levels of PA. Furthermore, each patient received a
British Lung Foundation exercise handbook which provided added
support regarding the educational sessions as well as resources to record


exercise and PA conducted outside of the weekly PR sessions. Patients in
both groups with a baseline hospital anxiety and/or depression score
(HADS) ≥8 (either for anxiety or depression) received up to three ses­
sions of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) by a specialist respiratory
nurse lasting for 30 min. The number of CBT sessions suggested and
timescale for such sessions were co-developed with the patients
depending on the patients’ individual response to treatment to manage
symptoms based on their subjective feedback, HADS questionnaire re­
sults and patient preference [26]. CBT focused on understanding how
experiences were interpreted, and made up of four elements: behaviour,
cognition/thoughts, feelings/emotions, and physical sensations [27].

_2.4. PA behavioural modification interventions_

Prior to the initiation of the PA behavioural modification in­
terventions, patients received a one-to-one semi-structured motivational
interview with the researcher discussing motivational issues, favourite
activities, facilitators and barriers to PA and strategies to become more
physically active [28]. Throughout the interview, patients were ques­
tioned about their self-efficacy and motivational levels. On completion
of the interview, each patient created a plan with the researcher con­
sisting of three concrete actions, which could be used to increase PA
levels. This plan consisted of favourite activities and was implemented
throughout the PA behavioural modification interventions to stimulate
patient’s self-motivation. Following this, the PA behavioural modifica­
tion interventions involved the provision of a pedometer (Fitbug,
Camden, London), an individualised daily step-count target (reviewed
twice weekly for 8 weeks), and a step-count diary that was brought to
every PR session (twice weekly). Patients were encouraged to achieve
the agreed target each day and to record the attained pedometer step
count in their step count diary each evening. Patients were asked to
attend each PR session with their step count diary, enabling the
researcher to frequently observe their activity levels, assess overall
compliance to the intervention and provide the appropriate level of
support based on their recorded activity levels. Based on the feedback
from step count diaries, the researcher calculated a daily step-count
target based on an increase of 10% from the preceding week’s average
daily step-count, with the first week’s target derived from baseline
accelerometer step count data (Actigraph wGT3X, Actigraph LLC, Pen­
sacola, FL, USA) [29] and during subsequent weeks from the pedometer
(Fitbug) step count data. During the weekly step-count review, educa­
tion on the importance of PA and advice on how to increase PA levels
were provided, including a focus on the barriers and facilitators to PA,
whilst taking into consideration the three concrete actions that were
outlined in the motivational interview [29].

_2.5. Outcome measures_

The Clinical PROactive C-PPAC instrument, which was previously
validated for use in patients with COPD [22], required both question­
naire and accelerometer-derived PA data (Actigraph wGT3X, Actigraph
LLC, Pensacola, FL, USA) and was implemented one week prior to the
onset of the PR programme and one week following completion of the
PR programme. The C-PPAC questionnaire included 12-items with a
7-day recall and was completed using paper and pen as shown in the
online supplementary materials (Table S1). Patients were also instructed
to wear an accelerometer previously validated to be part of the C-PPAC
tool (Actigraph wGT3X, Actigraph LLC, Pensacola, FL, USA) [21] during
waking hours for seven consecutive days prior to the onset of the PR
programme [30]. A valid assessment of patient’s PA was considered if
patients recorded more than 8 h of wear time on at least 4 weekdays
within the 7-day period [21]. C-PPAC scores were calculated by
combining questionnaire items with two objective variables from the
activity monitor (steps/day and VMU). Three scores were generated
(amount of PA, difficulty of PA and total PA experience) ranging from
0 to 100, where higher numbers indicated a better score [21].


-----

Other outcome measures taken prior to the onset of PR and imme­
diately following completion of PR included: the 6 min walking distance
(6MWD) [31]; leg muscle strength and endurance (one leg extension
repetition maximum using a calibrated Myometer (MIE Medical
Research Ltd, Leeds, UK) and 30 s sit to stand repetitions), respectively

[32,33]; handgrip strength [34]; health-related quality of life (COPD
assessment test [CAT]) [35], the clinical COPD questionnaire [CCQ]

[36]); and anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale [HADS] [37]); [38].

_2.6. Patient acceptability and compliance_

Patient acceptability of the PA behavioural modification in­
terventions was assessed through a project-tailored questionnaire
modified from another study [39]. During the final visit of the study,
patients filled in a self-administered, project tailored, multiple choice
questionnaire about their experiences with the intervention and the
usefulness of its components on a 10-point Likert scale as previously
described [39] and shown in Table S2 of the online supplementary
material. Data from the project-tailored questionnaire were scored as
categorical variables and reported as frequencies and percentages
(number of patients indicating each answer), except for the usefulness
ratings of the components, which were expressed as median [P25–P75].
Patient compliance to components of the behavioural modification in­
terventions was assessed via the following means: i) fractional number
of weekly goal setting targets met; ii) fractional number of weekly
completions of PA diaries and iii) average weekly wear time of the
pedometer. Data on patient compliance were reported as percentages
and median (P25–P75) and as mean ± SD depending on the variable
assessed.

_2.7. Data analysis_

Verification of the sample size was based on the study by Louvaris
et al. [40] comparing PR to usual care (UC). Based on the mean differ­
ence in the C-PPAC total score (7.4 units) between PR and UC and
observed SD (8.5 units), an alpha significance level of 0.05 (2-sided) and
80% power, a minimum sample of 24 patients per group was considered
to be sufficient to detect significant differences in the total C-PPAC score
between PR + PA and PR. Based on previous studies on similar PR
programmes in the UK [15], considering an attrition rate of 20% the
total sample size was increased to 58 patients. Randomisation was
stratified by the 6MWD (<350 m or ≥ 350 m), and the average HADS
score for anxiety and depression (<8 points or ≥8 points) using a block
size of 4 at the onset of the PR programme.
Patient characteristics and outcome data at baseline and following
PR are reported as means ± SD unless otherwise stated. Within and
between group differences pre-to post interventions are reported as
mean, 95% confidence intervals (CI). Independent samples t tests were
implemented to compare baseline group characteristics. A two-way
repeated measures ANOVA was implemented for all outcome variables
to identify differences between the two interventions. Statistical signif­
icance was set at p < 0.05 for all analyses.

**3. Results**

_3.1. Participants_

In total, 70 patients provided consent for the study at visit 1, while 60
patients were randomised at visit 2 to PR + PA (n = 31) and PR alone (n
= 29) (Fig. 1). Reasons for withdrawal following consent are provided in
Fig. 1. There were no significant between-group differences in any of the
baseline characteristics (Table 1). Throughout the study, 12 patients
were lost due to: ECOPD (n = 6), non-respiratory illness’ (n = 5) and
inability to attend the PR programme (n = 1). Therefore, 48 patients
completed the post-PR assessment visit, with 24 patients completing PR

_3.2. Patient experience of PA_

The effect of PR + PA compared to PR alone on all dimensions of the
C-PPAC instrument for each patient is shown in Fig. 2. Postinterventions, the _total score_ of the C-PPAC instrument was improved
by a clinically important margin (>4 points) [21] in the PR + PA group
compared with the PR alone group, with a between group difference of 8
points (95% CI 4 to 12 points; p = 0.001) (Table 2). In regard to the
_difficulty score_ of the C-PPAC instrument, clinically important (>6
points) [21] improvements were reported in the PR + PA group
compared with the PR alone group, with a between group difference of 8
points (95% CI 3 to 13 points; p = 0.002) (Table 2). Finally, clinically
important (>6 points) [21] improvements in the _amount score_ of the
C-PPAC tool were reported in the PR + PA group compared to the PR
alone group, with a between group difference of 8 points; (95% CI 3 to
16 points, p = 0.005) (Table 2).

_3.3. Physical activity outcomes_

Changes in accelerometer-derived PA variables are shown in Table 2.
Post intervention, clinically important (600–1100 steps/day) [19] im­
provements in accelerometer steps/day data were found in the PR + PA
intervention only, with a between group difference of 1016 steps/day
(95% CI 556 to 1474 steps/day, _p_ = 0.001) (Table 2). Following the
completion of the PR programme a significant improvement in accel­
erometer movement intensity was recorded in PR + PA group only, with
a between group difference of 93 VMU (95% CI 41 to 145 VMU, p =
0.001, Table 2). Finally, following completion of the PR programme, a
significant improvement in time spent in light PA was recorded only in
the PR + PA intervention, with a between group difference of 22 min
(95% CI 2 to 43, p = 0.030) (Table 2).

_3.4. Other outcomes_

The 6MWD improved following both PR + PA and PR alone in­
terventions, with similar within group changes (Table 3). Significant
between group improvements were reported in upper and lower body
strength and clinically important differences in the CAT score in favour
of the PR + PA group (Table 3).

_3.5. Intervention acceptability and compliance_

Overall, the PR + PA intervention was well received by patients, with
75% indicating they “liked taking part in the intervention a lot”.
Furthermore, 58% of patients claimed the intervention “helped them a

lot” regarding completing more PA outside of PR. The majority of pa­
tients (79%) experienced the proposed weekly increases in step goals as
“reasonable”, whereas 21% of patients experienced these increases as “a
little too high” or “a little too low”. The usability of the pedometer was
deemed “very easy” in 96% of patients. Patients rated the usefulness of
components of the PR + PA intervention with scores based on a satis­
faction scale (0 terrible to 10 perfect) with the step counter (median

[P25–P75]; 9 [8–10]), daily step goals (8 [8,9]) and feedback from
researcher (9 [8–10]) all deemed useful parts of the intervention.
Regarding patient compliance, the average weekly wear time of the
Fitbug pedometer was high equivalent to 6.6 ± 0.2 days worn.
Compliance with the PA diary to self-reported daily step counts was also
high (91 ± 18%), with a median number of 55 [49–56] recorded days
over the 8 weeks. Finally, compliance with step goal targets throughout
the 8 weeks was high, with an average 68 ± 12% of step goals achieved.
In terms of pedometer (Fitbug) steps/day (PR + PA patients only), sig­
nificant improvements were reported from baseline to end of the


intervention (by 1566 steps/day: 95% CI 681 to 2357, p = 0.001).

**4. Discussion**

The novel finding of this study is the clinically important improve­
ments in COPD patients’ experiences of PA following PR + PA compared
to PR alone in patients with advanced COPD exhibiting low baseline PA
levels. Improvements in the 6MWD were similar for both interventions,
however the magnitude of improvement in upper and lower muscle
strength was greater in the PR + PA intervention. Collectively these
findings suggest that PA behavioural modification interventions along­
side PR provide insightful support to patients with low baseline levels of
PA to translate PR-induced improvements in functional capacity into
improvements in patients’ experiences of PA.
Previous literature has documented the response of the C-PPAC in­
strument in two behavioural modification interventions [29,41].
Demeyer and colleagues [29] found a significant between group

difference in both the total and amount dimensions of the C-PPAC in­
strument following 12 weeks of semi-automated PA tele-coaching
delivered via a smartphone app. It should be noted that the usual care
group reported a large decrease in C-PPAC scores following a 12-week
period, with only small improvements in C-PPAC scores reported
following the tele-coaching intervention, thereby suggesting that the
tele-coaching intervention only had marginal effects on the C-PPAC tool

[29]. Furthermore, Demeyer and colleagues were unable to demonstrate
an improvement in the difficulty dimension of the C-PPAC instrument

[29]. The difficulty dimension has demonstrated a moderate-strong
correlation with health status, chronic dyspnea and exercise capacity

[21], which is not captured by the amount dimension. The study by
Demeyer et al. [29] did not include any specific exercise training and as
a result was unsuccessful in demonstrating improvements in exercise
capacity, which may be the reason for not reporting an improvement in
the difficulty domain following 12-weeks of tele-coaching [29].
Arbillaga and colleagues [41] implemented a 12-month urban


training programme that incorporated behavioural and
community-based exercise interventions in patients with COPD. The
C-PPAC instrument was able to detect a significant improvement from
baseline to 12 months in both the amount and difficulty C-PPAC scores,
however improvements were not significant between the intervention
and the usual care groups [41]. Considering the magnitude of change in
the C-PPAC total scores between the intervention and control groups in
the studies of Arbillaga-Extarri [41] (4.5 units) and Demeyer [29] (4.5
units) and that of the current study (8 units), it is clear that PA behav­
ioural techniques added to PR are superior to PA behavioural in­
terventions alone in improving the total score of the C-PPAC instrument.
Louvaris and colleagues [40] presented significant and clinically
important improvements in the total score of the C-PPAC instrument
following PR (5.6 units), which was not found in the PR alone group (1
unit) in the current study. Louvaris and colleagues [40] provided a
different type of PR, with their programme consisting of 3 sessions per
week for a total of 10 weeks, whilst the current study consisted of 2


-----

sessions per week for 8 weeks. Secondly, Louvaris and colleagues [40]
prescribed high-intensity interval exercise, whereas the current study
implemented moderate intensity exercise. Furthermore, COPD patients
in the Louvaris et al. study [40] presented greater baseline levels of PA
and 6MWD than the current study, which has previously been docu­
mented to influence the effectiveness of interventions to improve PA

[18]. With this in mind, it is plausible that the incorporation of PA
behavioural modification interventions, in conjunction with improved
functional capacity through PR exercise training, yielded clinically
important improvements in all C-PPAC dimensions in patients with very
low levels of PA at baseline (approximately 3000 steps/day) [21].
Importantly, several components of the PA behavioural modification
interventions used in the current study, including patient education on
the benefits of PA and incorporating behaviour change techniques such
as goal setting, action planning and self-monitoring, may have
empowered and motivated patients to engage in more daily activity.
Such behavioural modification components have been shown to benefit
COPD patients’ readiness, motivation and confidence to engage in PA
and were associated with significant improvements in PA behaviour

[42]. Furthermore, the initial motivation interview stimulated a dis­
cussion between patient and researcher regarding preferred and
non-preferred activities, allowing the researcher to tailor weekly PA
goals around activities that the patient enjoyed, encouraging
self-motivation within the patient [12]. Finally, attending each PR ses­
sion with a step count diary and twice-weekly face-to-face consultations
gave the research team an insight into the compliance of each patient,
and enabled researchers to intervene if patients were unable to cope
with the present goals.

_4.1. Study limitations_

There are several limitations that must be considered in this study.
Our inability to blind patients to the study allocation may have impacted
on the overall quality of evidence and increased the risk of bias towards
the intervention. Our failure to blind patients was based on several
reasons. Firstly, it would require a pedometer being issued to the PR
alone group. Although the simple addition of a pedometer alongside
generic advice on PA provided during PR doesn’t necessary provide any
form of PA counselling, the stimulus and incentive to self-manage and
increase steps/day with the availability of a pedometer may impact
upon the steps/day of the PR alone group. Secondly, in order to remain
comparable with previous literature, we followed the procedure of
several previous studies that implemented PA counselling alongside
standard care PR [10,12,13,15], of which pedometers were not provided
to the control group. In future studies however, investigators may wish
to follow the blinding procedure of two recent studies in COPD [16,41].
Varas and colleagues [16] blinded patients by allocating a pedometer to
both intervention and control groups, but provided no pedometer spe­
cific instructions to the control group. Meanwhile, Arbillaga and col­
leagues [41] took a different approach by refraining the existence of an
alternative group to patients. The latter would be difficult to incorporate
into the current study due to the lack of resources available to run two
separate PR programmes simultaneously, in order to refrain the exis­
tence of groups from one another.
Due to all measures being administered in a face-to-face manner by a
single researcher, bias related to the researcher providing the PA
behavioural modification interventions couldn’t be avoided and blind­
ing of assessor was not possible.
This was a small-scale study, therefore, generalisability of the results
to clinical practice may be limited. Finally, the present behavioral
modification interventions alongside PR were well received by the vast
majority of patients showing high compliance, however such behavioral
interventions may require significant health care resources as they are
more time consuming compared to PA tele-coaching [38].


**5. Conclusions**

Incorporating PA behavioural modification interventions alongside a
PR programme conveys improvements in functional capacity into
improved experiences of PA in COPD patients with low baseline PA and
exercise capacity levels.
