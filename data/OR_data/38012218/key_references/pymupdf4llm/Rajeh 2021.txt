**Abstract**
**Background: Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**
commonly experience exacerbations, which may require hospital admission.
Early detection of exacerbations, and therefore early treatment, could be crucial
in preventing admission and improving outcomes. Our previous research has
demonstrated that the pattern analysis of peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2)
fluctuations provides novel insights into the engagement of the respiratory control system in response to physiological stress (hypoxia). Therefore, this pilot
study tested the hypothesis that the pattern of SpO2 variations in overnight recordings of individuals with COPD would distinguish between stable and exacerbation phases of the disease.
**Methods: Overnight pulse oximetry data from 11 individuals with COPD, who**
exhibited exacerbation after a period of stable disease, were examined. Stable
phase recordings were conducted overnight and one night prior to exacerbation
recordings were also analyzed. Pattern analysis of SpO2 variations was carried
examined using sample entropy (for assessment of irregularity), the multiscale

entropy (complexity), and detrended fluctuation analysis (self-­similarity).

**Results: SpO2 variations displayed a complex pattern in both stable and exacerba-**
tion phases of COPD. During an exacerbation, SpO2 entropy increased (p = 0.029)
and long-­term fractal-­like exponent (α2) decreased (p = 0.002) while the mean
and standard deviation of SpO2 time series remained unchanged. Through ROC
analyses, SpO2 entropy and α2 were both able to classify the COPD phases into either stable or exacerbation phase. With the best positive predictor value (PPV) for
sample entropy (PPV = 70%) and a cut-­off value of 0.454. While the best negative
predictor value (NPV) was α2 (NPV = 78%) with a cut-­off value of 1.00.
**Conclusion: Alterations in SpO2 entropy and the fractal-­like exponent have the**
potential to detect exacerbations in COPD. Further research is warranted to examine if SpO2 variability analysis could be used as a novel objective method of
detecting exacerbations.

### 1 | INTRODUCTION

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a
global health burden estimated to affect 251 million people worldwide and carries with it high mortality (Husebø
et al., 2014; Mathers & Loncar, 2006). In COPD, individuals commonly experience exacerbations of their illness leading to a sudden deterioration in their health (Al
Rajeh et al., 2020). Patients report that exacerbations are
the most disruptive aspect of living with COPD (Zhang
et al., 2018). This often leads to hospital admissions; with
poor prognosis (Al Rajeh et al., 2020). Consequently, the
prevention of exacerbations is essential when managing
COPD (Hurst, Vestbo, et al., 2010) and better prevention
of COPD exacerbations has been identified as a top research priority (Alqahtani et al., 2021).
Although several tools have been proposed to help detect exacerbations earlier, to the best of our knowledge,
there is no sensitive method of predicting exacerbation
risk or rate accurately (Adibi et al., 2020; Al Rajeh et al.,
2020; Donaldson et al., 2012; Hurst, Vestbo, et al., 2010).
Clinical studies have, however, attempted to investigate
the utility of changes in various physiological parameters
including heart rate, forced expiratory volume (FEV1),
respiratory rate and level of peripheral oxygen saturation
(SpO2) before and during exacerbation with limited success (Al Rajeh et al., 2020.; Al Rajeh & Hurst, 2016; Burton
et al., 2015; Hurst, Donaldson, et al., 2010; Hurst, Vestbo,
et al., 2010; Husebø et al., 2014). While pulse oximetry has
some role when monitoring individuals in the community, there is no clear benefit of using mean values and
overnight readings with the prediction of exacerbations
due to the insignificant magnitude of the changes (Al
Rajeh et al., 2020).
Recent evidence has demonstrated that the complex
pattern of variability in SpO2 signals may provide more
mechanistic insight than absolute or mean SpO2 values
(Bhogal & Mani, 2017; Costello et al., 2020; Jiang et al.,
2021). SpO2 signals exhibit a complex fractal-­like pattern in hypoxic individuals (Costello et al., 2020). Using
a network physiology approach, we have demonstrated
that SpO2 fluctuations are not random and contain useful information about the engagement of respiratory control during hypoxia (Jiang et al., 2021). Furthermore, we
also reported that SpO2 entropy, but not absolute or mean
SpO2, was correlated with the perception of breathlessness
in the same otherwise healthy individuals when hypoxic


(Costello et al., 2020). These data suggest that there is a
significant exchange of information between SpO2 and
other respiratory variables (i.e. tidal volume, minute ventilation, respiratory rate, end-­tidal oxygen, and carbon
dioxide pressure) during graded normobaric hypoxia
in healthy participants (Jiang et al., 2021). Fluctuations
in these respiratory variables were reflected in the SpO2
signal, specifically in SpO2 entropy (Jiang et al., 2021), a
measure that describes the unpredictability and irregularity of these SpO2 signals (Richman & Moorman, 2000).
Calculated using a well-­established algorithm (Richman
& Moorman, 2000), SpO2 entropy may reveal additional
information about cardiorespiratory control in health and
disease (Jiang et al., 2021).
To date, the usefulness of SpO2 variability analysis has
not been studied extensively in COPD. Accordingly, this
pilot study investigated the hypothesis that SpO2 variability would distinguish between the two phases of COPD
(stable vs. exacerbation). As SpO2 entropy is easily computed and incorporated into bedside monitors or smart
devices, this method could assist in the earlier detection
of COPD exacerbations and, following faster access to
the necessary treatment, ultimately result in an improved
prognosis (Qureshi et al., 2014; Wilkinson et al., 2004).

### 2 | METHODS

 2.1 | Participants

From September 2016 to January 2018, participants were
recruited from COPD clinics and pulmonary rehabilitation


**New & Noteworthy**

This report provides evidence that the pattern of
peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) fluctuations
detects exacerbations in individuals with COPD.
The entropy of SpO2 signal increases a day prior to
clinical diagnosis of exacerbation in COPD while
mean and total variability of SpO2 signals remain
unchanged. This finding has the potential for development of a non-­invasive method for early detection of exacerbations in COPD.

classes at three separate sites in London. All participants
were fully informed and submitted written consent forms.
The UK Health Research Authority and Royal Free
Hospital local committee granted ethical approvals on
data collection (16/LO/1120). The inclusion criteria consisted of COPD diagnosis [smoking history ≥10 pack years
and post-­bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.7 (suggesting a
non-­reversible obstructive lung disease pattern)], one or
more self-­reported moderate or severe exacerbations of
their COPD in the last 12 months, and the ability to attend scheduled appointments and use study equipment.
Individuals were excluded if they had an existing diagnosis
of obstructive sleep apnea either via self-­report or results
of STOP-­Bang and Epworth questionnaires (Johns, 1991;
Nagappa et al., 2015), and/or significant co-­morbidities
that prevented participation (Al Rajeh et al., 2020).
The clinical recordings used for analysis are credited
to a recently published pilot randomized controlled trial
regarding COPD exacerbation detection (Al Rajeh et al.,
2020). The data in this analysis derives from one arm
of this study looking at overnight monitoring of COPD
(n = 44). Some of the data, including individual demographics and mean SpO2, but importantly not any SpO2
variability data, have already been published in the referenced study (Al Rajeh et al., 2020). In the original study,
only 13 participants exacerbated in the time frame of the
study and were included in the analysis. The quality of
SpO2 recording for two individuals was limited (less than
90 mins continuous SpO2 signal) and therefore these participants were excluded from the analysis (n = 11). In the
study, there were 7 male participants and 4 female participants (n = 11) with an average age (SD) of 71.8 (10.4)
years. Of these participants, 3 were current smokers, with
8 ex-­smokers. The baseline clinical characteristics for the
population studied can be found in Table 1.

### 2.2 | Data collection

Each participant received a wristband pulse oximeter
(Nonin 3150, Nonin Medical Inc.) and was instructed by
researchers on using it. Each pulse oximeter measured the
SpO2 time series of each participant overnight. In the original clinical trial, participants were closely monitored during
the first 2 weeks of the study to ensure they were using the
equipment properly and recording data accurately. They

were considered “stable” during this 2-­week period when
there was no incidence of exacerbation. An exacerbation
was defined as the need for oral corticosteroids or antibiotics, as judged by the patient's clinician or self-­management
plan (Al Rajeh et al., 2020). The first set of continuous SpO2
time series available from the stable phase was used for the
calculation of SpO2 variability indices in this study. The
sampling rate of SpO2 recording was 0.25 Hz (one sample
recorded every 4 s). SpO2 signals were saved as comma-­
separated value (csv.) files for stability and one day prior to
exacerbation phase separately. The data were chosen one
day prior to exacerbation, as this offered insight into a useful window for the early detection of an exacerbation. In
this report, the signals recorded a day prior to clinical diagnosis of exacerbation are called “exacerbation phase”.

### 2.3 | SpO2 variability

The longest duration of time that all individuals had of uninterrupted SpO2 data was ~90 min, so the first available 90-­
min recording was used for the analyses. Well-­established
measures within this field to analyze the patterns of variability (Bhogal & Mani, 2017), including standard deviation (SD), sample entropy, Multiscale Entropy (MSE), and
Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) (Bhogal & Mani,
2017) were employed.
Details of these methods and associated algorithms
are described in detail elsewhere [DFA (Peng et al., 1995),
MSE (Costa et al., 2002), and sample entropy (Richman
& Moorman, 2000)]. In brief, sample entropy looks at the
complexity of a time series by analyzing the probability
of repetition of a signal, with a particular length (m) and
degree of tolerance (r). In this study, sample entropy was
determined under the settings of _m at 2 and_ _r at 0.2 as_
previously described (Richman & Moorman, 2000). MSE
looks at entropy at different time scales, and as such is
seen as an extension of sample entropy. The trends of entropy change within this time scales provide further information on the complexity of a data set. For this analysis,
MSE was used over five scales in accordance with current
practice (Costa et al., 2002). Finally, to examine the fractality of the SpO2 data, we employed DFA as it looks at
the self-­similarity of a time series providing information
on the fractal-­like dynamics present (Peng et al., 1995).
In a DFA plot, the logarithm of fluctuation (standard

deviation) of detrended time series is plotted against the
logarithm of scale (n). The slope of this line is known as
the scaling exponent (α). Previous studies proved there to
be a “cross-­over” in SpO2 DFA graph, thus the short-­term
and long-­term scaling exponent, α1 and α2 are calculated
separately as described elsewhere (Bhogal & Mani, 2017).
All calculations were completed in MATLAB (Matworks
R2020b).

### 2.4 | Statistical analysis

All statistical tests were performed using MATLAB
(Matworks R2020b) and SPSS software. A paired two-­
tailed Student's t-­test was employed for comparing the
mean, SD, α1 and α2 of COPD individuals (n = 11) during
a stable phase to that of the same cohort a day prior to the
clinical diagnosis of an exacerbation. A two-­way ANOVA
was used to analyze the results of MSE, with statistical
significance taken as a _p-­value less than 0.05. Receiver_

operating characteristic (ROC) curves of sample entropy
at 5 scales, α1 and α2 of individuals were plotted by SPSS
for further investigation of the differences in these indices between the two phases and their potential to detect
early exacerbation (exacerbation phase). Area under the
curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and a cut-­
off value of each index were also determined from ROC
curves.

### 3 | RESULTS

 3.1 | Pattern analysis of SpO2 variability

The SpO2 signals for exacerbation and stable phase show
a complex pattern (see Figure 1). A summary of mean
SpO2 and the various variability indices are displayed in
Table 2. Overall, mean SpO2 during the stable phase was
not statistically different to that of the exacerbation phase
(91.4 ± 1.89% vs. 90.6 ± 2.11%; p = 0.125), likewise, the
mean SD of both phases were similar (Table 2).
Mean sample entropy increased (0.395 ± 0.101 vs.
0.505 ± 0.159; _p_ < 0.05) during exacerbation. This indicates an increased irregularity of the signal; however, in
order to assess whether this change was random or complex, we analyzed the data using MSE (Bhogal & Mani,
2017). This difference is constantly observed across the
increasing scale factor using MSE (Figure 2), where the
values of mean sample entropy during exacerbation were
all higher than that of the stable phase. Two-­way ANOVA
analysis showed that there was a significant difference
in the MSE between the stable phase and exacerbation
phase (Fgroup = 8.63, p = 0.004), highlighting the increased
amount of information and complexity during an exacerbation. Additionally, an increasing trend of sample entropy value from scale 1 to 5 in both COPD phases was
observed (Figure 2), revealing that fluctuated SpO2 time
series is not a random process (Costa et al., 2002).
From DFA, the short-­term scaling exponent, α1 of
the stable phase (α1 = 1.17 ±0.110) and exacerbation
(α1 = 1.15 ± 0.137) were between values expected from

Brownian noise (α = 1.50) and 1/f dynamics (α = 1.00);
however, their values did not differ between phases
(p = 0.55). However, the long-­term scaling exponent,
α2, of both phases approached closer to 1/f dynamics
(α2 = 1.04 ± 0.114 in stable and α2 = 0.925 ± 0.107 in
exacerbation), confirming that SpO2 fluctuations have a
fractal-­like pattern (Bhogal & Mani, 2017). Statistical significance was shown between α2 of exacerbation vs stable
phase (p < 0.01), validating there was a slight reduction

in scaling exponent and shift toward white noise dynamics during exacerbation. Two example graphs of the DFA
analysis obtained from the SpO2 time series are shown in
Appendix A.

### 3.2 | ROC analysis of SpO2

ROC curves assessing the sensitivity and specificity of SpO2
variability indices in classifying stable from exacerbation
phase are presented in Figure 3. Sample Entropy and α2
exhibited a significant AUC with values of 0.702 and 0.777
respectively (Table 2). MSE indices at scales 2 and 3, also
had a significant statistical AUC with values of 0.711 and
0.719 respectively (Table 2). The best positive predictor
value (PPV) was for sample entropy (PPV = 70%) with a
cut-­off value of 0.454. The best negative predictor value
(NPV) was for α2 (NPV = 78%) with a cut-­off value of 1.00.

### 4 | DISCUSSION

This study tested the hypothesis that the pattern of SpO2
variations in overnight recordings of individuals with
COPD would distinguish between stable and exacerbation
phases. In support of the hypothesis, our novel findings
suggest that sample entropy at different scales increases,
while the long-­term scaling exponent (α2) decreases, a day
prior to the clinical diagnosis of an exacerbation of COPD.
These indices were also different during the stable and

-----

exacerbation phases, while mean SpO2 remained stable
throughout. Furthermore, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV from ROC analyses, sample entropy of
the original SpO2 time series and α2 of DFA appear to have
the best diagnostic capabilities to support earlier detection
of COPD exacerbations.
This study extends our earlier work in SpO2 variability analysis in healthy individual after exposure to hypoxia to individuals with chronic lung disease (Bhogal
& Mani, 2017; Costello et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2021). We
have shown an increased in sample entropy in healthy
participants during exposure to normobaric hypoxia
(Costello et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2021) and here we
have similarly demonstrated a higher sample entropy
0.395–­0.505, and in all scales in MSE, following COPD
exacerbation. Interestingly, these previous reports established that there is an inverse correlation between
mean SpO2 and SpO2 Sample Entropy under both normoxic and hypoxic environments in healthy individuals
(Bhogal & Mani, 2017; Costello et al., 2020), with lower
oxygen saturation correlated with higher SpO2 entropy.
This relationship was not observed in the current study
(Appendix B), which could suggest a compromise in the
cardiorespiratory integrity in COPD (O’Donnell et al.,
2020). Another consideration for the lack of correlation
between mean SpO2 and sample entropy in our cohort;
could be the wide range of SpO2 values included in the
present study (individuals with COPD) versus the other
reports in healthy participants. Nevertheless, future
studies with a larger number of participants could test
this hypothesis.
According to Pincus (1994), higher entropy signifies
greater amounts of information being processed in a complex physiological system, reflecting the enhanced connections and communications across various components
within that system (Pincus, 1994). In terms of the cardiorespiratory system and its homeostatic control of oxygen
saturation, Jiang et al. (2021) provided further insight by
using a network physiology approach to show that the
information controlling oxygen saturation was communicated across several key components of the cardiorespiratory system. Therefore, when this system is under hypoxic
stress either through a decrease in the fraction of inspired
oxygen or in a clinical state (COPD); the transfer of information is increased across these components to maintain
mean SpO2. This is demonstrated by the rise in sample
entropy when healthy individuals are hypoxic (Costello
et al., 2020), as well as during an exacerbation in COPD
(see Figure 2 and Table 2).
The sample entropy in both stable and exacerbation
phases of COPD (0.395 ± 0.101 vs. 0.505 ± 0.159) is notably less than the sample entropy value of healthy individuals (0 98 ± 0 28) with the same mean value of mean


SpO2 (93.94 ± 1.85%) during hypoxic challenge (Jiang
et al., 2021). This may be attributed to the disruption
of functional connectivity within cardiorespiratory system when COPD is diagnosed (Donaldson et al., 2012).
This is reflected in the impaired response to hypoxia
and changes in ventilation that often lead to hypercapnia (Abdo & Heunks, 2012). This disruption in the
control system limits the adaptive response to hypoxia
during exacerbation, thus reflected by a limited increase
in sample entropy. This hypothesis requires further
examination with more stringent control of possible
confounders such as age, lifestyle (e.g., smoking), and
environment. For example, we have reported that aging
reduces SpO2 entropy in otherwise healthy individuals
(Bhogal & Mani, 2017). This supports the theory that the
integrity of cardiorespiratory control system is affected
by aging and chronic diseases such as COPD (O’Donnell
et al., 2020; Strait & Lakatta,). However, future studies should aim to compare SpO2 entropy between age-­
matched healthy cohorts and COPD individuals in
different phases to help explain the changes seen in an
exacerbation and better predict future exacerbations.
It is now well-­established that the DFA of SpO2 signals results in two scaled components, one representing
short-­term (α1) and the other long-­term (α2) fractal-­
like fluctuations (Bhogal & Mani, 2017). Table 2 illustrates a statistically significant decrease in α2 upon
exacerbation while α1 remains stable. Interestingly, this
data trend contradicts a study assessing DFA’s usefulness in diagnosing childhood sleep apnea-­hypopnoea
(Vaquerizo-­Villar et al., 2018). Like COPD, sleep apnea
is also associated with hypoxia; however, it is due to
episodic upper airway collapse during sleep (Stradling
et al., 2004). By applying DFA in their study, Vaquerizo-­
Villar et al. (2018) observed an increased α1 with intensified apnea-­hypopnoea severity while α2 was unaltered.
These results are likely due to the different underlying
pathophysiology in the two diseases. Despite both leading to dyspnea, apnea-­hypopnoea is associated with
acute episodic hypoxia reflected by alternation in the
short-­term scaling component (α1). While in COPD, individuals suffer from chronic hypoxia leading to changes
in the long-­term scaling component (α2) (Khatri &
Ioachimescu, 2016). Furthermore, the faster breathing
pattern in younger children, and the associated dynamics of apnea-­hypopnoea occurrences, may also translate
to shorter time scales being more sensitive than longer
time scales in disease relative to adults.
Although the values of the ROC analysis of the sample
entropy and α2 showed moderate levels of sensitivity and
specificity, this was the first attempt to suggest their potential in supporting earlier diagnosis of COPD exacerbations Judging from the ‘zigzag’ shape of the ROC analysis

(Figure 3) and repeated values in sensitivity and specificity (Table 3), we speculate that this was due to the small
sample size in the current study (n = 11) or insufficient
heterogeneity/range in the predictor measures. Previous
work had proposed the effectiveness of COPD Assessment
Test (CAT) questionnaire to evaluate disease severity, as
CAT score significantly increases during exacerbation
(Mackay et al., 2012). However, this method showed an
AUC of 0.64 for the CAT questionnaire in 491 COPD individuals in detecting exacerbations (Lee et al., 2014), which
is less than that of both sample entropy (AUC = 0.702)
and α2 (AUC = 0.777) in our analysis. CAT is a well-­
established scoring system for monitoring COPD, but its
diagnostic value may be compromised by its subjectivity.
As SpO2 analysis is a useful predictor of dyspnea, and a
key component of the CAT questionnaire (Costello et al.,
2020), combining the objective SpO2 analysis with the CAT
questionnaire could provide the most accurate predictor
of future exacerbations.
In the present data, we had access to 90 min of signal
in all individuals and showed that SpO2 variability indices
can distinguish between stable and exacerbation phases.
In a preliminary analysis, we also examined shorter intervals of SpO2 signals (i.e., 60, 50, 40, 30, and 15 min). As
shown in Appendix C, we applied Bland-­Altman analysis
to the data and found that 60 min is also sufficient for SpO2
sample entropy analysis, while DFA requires 90 min to
detect an exacerbation. While this might not be clinically
feasible for spot-­checking hypoxia in acute scenarios, this
analysis combined with better SpO2 wearable technology
may improve management in individuals experiencing
chronic hypoxia (Buekers et al., 2019).

### 4.1 | Limitations and future research

Like other pilot studies, the major limitation of the current study is the small sample size. The source of SpO2 recording data in this study was from a pilot randomized
controlled trial testing the effectiveness of overnight


physiological monitoring to predict COPD exacerbation
(Al Rajeh et al., 2020). With the limited sample, there is
a risk of low statistical power and type II error. However,
despite the small sample size, our results reached statistical significance. This demonstrates the potential of SpO2
variability analysis in non-­invasively detecting early exacerbations for timely treatment and the need for future
studies with larger sample sizes. This method also has the
potential to monitor exacerbation recovery and provide
an objective tool for discharge in these individuals, and
future studies can help determine this.
Since data were obtained from a randomized clinical
trial with regular follow-­up of the participants, the chance
of selection bias is low. However, a possible source of bias
in this study is the availability of long (>90 min) continuous SpO2 signal in the participants. In the present study,
two participants had less than 90 min continuous SpO2
signals in their stable phase and were not included in this
study. Future studies can investigate this limitation in a
larger multicentre trial to assess the value of SpO2 pattern
analysis in the prediction of exacerbation.
It is difficult to estimate an accurate cut-­off for separation of stable versus exacerbation phase based on such
a small sample size. To further test the validity of the cut-­
off value, we randomly selected samples from stable periods of the same participants recorded at different days
and measured SpO2 Sample Entropy. The mean (±SD) of
the randomly selected samples was 0.341 ± 134 (n = 11)
which was not significantly different from data presented
in Table 2 for the SpO2 Sample Entropy of stable phase
(0.395 ± 0.101). Furthermore, the rate of false positive was
18% when the cut-­off in Table 3 was used for the prediction of exacerbation. While these pilot results are promising, a comprehensive analysis of the reportability of SpO2
variability indices is required prior to the translation of
these findings into clinical practice.
Another limitation of this study is the severity of exacerbation was not measured. An exacerbation was defined as the need for oral corticosteroids or antibiotics, as
judged by the patient's clinician or self management plan


-----

This practical approach has its shortcomings as the prescription of oral corticosteroids/antibiotics following the
worsening of respiratory symptoms may vary among practitioners and healthcare systems (Celli et al., 2021 Sep 27).
Hurst et al., previously reported that a combined oximetry score (i.e., the positive magnitude in standard deviation units of the fall in SpO2 and the rise in heart rate)
could predict the onset of an exacerbation, prior to clinical
diagnosis (Hurst, Donaldson, et al., 2010). We had limited
access to high quality continuous signals 2–­3 days prior to
diagnosis of exacerbation in the current study and could
only include SpO2 variability analysis one day prior to clinical diagnosis of exacerbation. Therefore, future studies
can extend our pilot study by developing wearable devices
suitable for long-­term signal recording for SpO2 fluctuation analysis. In addition, similar to this combined oximetry score, novel analytical methods (e.g., transfer entropy)
have the potential to assess the interaction of heart rate
and SpO2 time series in order to develop a comprehensive
physiomarker for the non-­invasive assessment of patients
with COPD. Application of these methods in healthcare
warrant further investigations in larger studies.

### 5 | CONCLUSION

This is a proof-­of-­concept study demonstrating that
SpO2 fluctuation analysis has the potential to be used to
support earlier detection of exacerbations in individuals
with COPD. Specifically, the sample entropy increases
and there is an alteration in fractal-­like behavior of
SpO2 fluctuations during exacerbation. As pulse oximetry has recently been expanded beyond the measurement
of absolute peripheral oxygen saturation, measurement
of SpO2 dynamics has the potential to be incorporated
into smart devices to assist the early diagnosis of COPD
exacerbations.
