**Abstract**
This multi-centred, randomised controlled trial explored the effects of adding ongoing feedback to a 12-month unsupervised
maintenance walking program, on daily physical activity (PA) in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Participants were randomised to either an intervention group (IG) or a usual care group (UCG). During the maintenance program,
the IG received ongoing feedback (telephone calls, biofeedback provided via pedometer and progressive goal setting) and
the UCG received no feedback. The SenseWear® Pro3 Armband was used to measure PA. Of the 86 participants {IG = 42,
(mean [SD]: age 70 [7] years; ­FEV1 43 [16] % predicted); UCG = 44, (age 69 [9] years; ­FEV1 44 [15] % predicted)} included
at baseline, 43 had sufficient data to be included in the final analysis. There were no between-group differences in any of the
PA variables from baseline to completion of the program (all p > 0.05). Ongoing feedback was no more effective than no
feedback in improving PA during a 12-month unsupervised walking program.
Trial Registration: The trial was registered in the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry
(ACTRN12609000472279).

### Introduction

In people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), increasing participation in physical activity (PA)
is considered important with higher levels of daily PA associated with reduced hospital utilisation and mortality [1, 2].
One intervention that offers promise to increase PA is pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) [3–5]. This is because PR, with

the core component being supervised exercise training, has
been shown to improve exercise capacity and reduce symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue [6]. Where access to comprehensive PR is poor [7–9], a simple program of ground-based
walking training (GBWT) may be an alternative strategy
for the provision of exercise training and has previously
been shown to increase exercise capacity and health-related
quality of life (HRQoL) [10]. Nevertheless, there is little

evidence that gains made after a comprehensive PR program
translate into an increase in participation in PA [3, 11]. In
a recent meta-analysis, a significant increase in PA compared to usual care [4] [standardised mean difference (95%
CI): 0.84 (0.44–1.25)] was demonstrated following exercise
training but this finding was in contrast to an earlier review
of uncontrolled studies which showed only a small, significant increase in PA following training (overall mean effect
size = 0.12; p = 0.01) [3].
As walking is the most common form of PA undertaken
during daily life, it was hypothesised that a simple program
of supervised GBWT would translate into an increase in
participation in PA but this was not the case in the shortterm [12]. As studies in this area often assess the immediate
or short-term impact of PR, it is conceivable that improvements in PA may take longer to attain, and may be achieved
during a subsequent maintenance program that specifically
includes interventions designed to encourage adherence to
ongoing exercise training. Therefore, the aim of this study
was, in people who had completed a program of GBWT,
to evaluate the effects on PA of adding ongoing feedback
(telephone calls, biofeedback via pedometer and progressive
goal setting) to a 12-month unsupervised maintenance walking program compared to no feedback in people with COPD.

### Participants and Methods

This brief report presents longitudinal PA data from a
long-term, prospective, assessor-blinded, multi-centre
randomised controlled trial (RCT) [13]. Participants with
COPD were recruited from referrals to seven outpatient PR
programs in two cities in Australia. The trial was registered
in the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry
(ACTRN12609000472279). Details of inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomisation and stratification have previously been described [13]. Participants were randomised to
either an intervention group (IG) or usual care group (UCG).
Before commencing the 12-month maintenance period, both
groups received the same 2-month intervention of supervised GBWT, two or three times per week with effects on
exercise capacity, HRQoL and PA being previously reported

[10, 12]. In the maintenance period, both groups were
instructed to perform unsupervised walking training, 3 days
a week for 12 months. In addition, the IG received telephone
calls, feedback provided via a pedometer (G-Sensor accelerometer, Pedometers Australia, Cannington, WA, Australia)
and progressive goal setting (based on pedometer data) as
previously described [13].
Physical activity was measured using the SenseWear®
Pro3 Armband (SWA) (Bodymedia Inc, SenseWear Professional version 6.1, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) worn by participants for 7 days on three occasions over a 14-month

period as follows: T1 (baseline assessment), T2 (2 month
assessment end of GBWT) and T3 (end of 12-month maintenance period). Measures of PA were expressed as daily
energy expenditure (kcal), daily step count and time spent
in sedentary activities [1.0 to < 1.5 metabolic equivalents
(METs)], light intensity PA (1.5 to < 3.0 METs), moderate
intensity PA (3.0 to < 6.0 METs) and vigorous intensity PA
(time spent at ≥ 6.0 METs). To be included in the analyses,
participants needed to contribute SWA data over a minimum
of 3 days for at least 20 h each day. At all time points participants completed measures of HRQoL, exercise capacity
and spirometric lung function as previously described [13].

### Sample Size and Data Analysis

As the primary aim of the original study was to evaluate
the effect of the intervention on HRQoL [13], sample size
calculations were undertaken to ensure adequate power to
detect a meaningful between-group difference in the mean
total St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire score between
the IG and CG at T3. These calculations determined that a
sample size of 88 participants was required. Regarding the
analyses presented on the longitudinal PA data, a sample of
88 participants would be sufficient to detect a between-group
difference in average daily step count of 1200 steps assuming a SD of 2000 steps (two-sided α of 0.05, power of 80%)

[14]. Data were analysed using SPSS software (Version 20
for Windows, SPSS Inc, Chicago, ILL, USA). Linear mixed
models were used to determine significance between groups
across all time points using the sample that was available at
each time point. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted
with no imputation of missing values. A p value < 0.05 was
considered significant.

### Results

Eighty-six participants {(IG = 42 (30 males; mean [SD]:
age 70 [7] years; ­FEV1 43 [16] % predicted); UCG = 44 (23
males; age 69 [9] years; ­FEV1 44 [15] % predicted)} commenced the maintenance study. At T2, 62 participants (IG:
33, UCG: 29) and at T3, 43 participants (IG: 23, UCG: 20)
had sufficient SWA data to be included in the analysis. The
SWA was worn on average for six days (at least 23 h per day)
in both groups at each time point. Results of the PA analyses
are presented in Table 1 with change in average daily steps in
both groups presented in Fig. 1. On completion of the maintenance period, no significant between-group differences
were demonstrated in the change in average daily energy
expenditure, step count or time spent in sedentary, light,
moderate or vigorous PA from T1 to T3 or from T2 to T3.

### Discussion

This study is one of only a few rigorous RCTs that have
investigated the effects of a maintenance exercise training
program on PA in COPD. We hypothesised that although
short-term supervised GBWT did not result in an immediate change in PA [12] it may have taken longer for changes
in PA to occur. In standard clinical practice, it is costly to
provide ongoing supervision following completion of shortterm supervised exercise training programs. In this study, it
was hypothesised that a telephone intervention providing
ongoing feedback (biofeedback via pedometer and progressive goal setting) would result in improvements in PA as
previous literature has demonstrated that with the addition
of biofeedback strategies to telephone support, maintenance
of effects of short-term programs on HRQoL and exercise
capacity have been shown [15, 16]. Since both groups had
the capability to do more, as evidenced by improved exercise
capacity at the end of the 2-month supervised walking training [10], improvements in PA might have been expected,
especially in the IG. This study has not confirmed our
hypothesis. The lack of effect on PA in the IG may be attributed to the fact that the participants were only instructed to
wear the pedometers during their walking training sessions
and not instructed to use them to monitor participation in
daily PA. Consequently, the ongoing feedback provided by
the pedometer was to encourage participants in the IG to
walk at an appropriate intensity during their regular exercise
sessions rather than specifically to walk more in daily life.
The main limitation in this study was the lack of available
PA data at the T3 time point which was attributed to both
a 21% loss to follow-up in the maintenance study and only
43 participants having available SWA data at T3. Although
this lack of data creates uncertainty around the accuracy of
the results, a power calculation of our final sample demonstrated that 43 participants at T3 would have been sufficient
to detect a larger between-group difference in average daily
step count of 1700 steps.
In conclusion, this study investigated the effects of ongoing feedback on PA during a 12-month unsupervised maintenance walking program compared to no feedback. Despite
the hypothesis that ongoing feedback would improve PA levels during a maintenance program, there were no betweengroup differences in any PA variables from T1 to T3 or from
T2 to T3. Further studies are required to determine effective methods of facilitating improvements in PA levels to
take advantage of improvements in exercise capacity that
are evident after a supervised exercise program in people
with COPD.
