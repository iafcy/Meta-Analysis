ABSTRACT Physical inactivity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is
associated with poor health status and increased disease burden. The present study aims to test the efficacy
of a previously developed mobile (m)Health intervention to improve or maintain physical activity in
patients with COPD after pulmonary rehabilitation.
A randomised controlled trial was performed in 32 physiotherapy practices in the Netherlands. COPD
patients were randomised into intervention or usual care groups. The intervention consisted of a
smartphone application for the patients and a monitoring website for the physiotherapists. Measurements
were performed at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months. Physical activity, functional exercise capacity, lung function,
health-related quality of life and body mass index were assessed.
157 patients started the study and 121 completed it. There were no significant positive effects of the
intervention on physical activity (at 0 months: intervention 5824±3418 steps per weekday, usual care 5717±2870
steps per weekday; at 12 months: intervention 4819±2526 steps per weekday, usual care 4950±2634 steps
per weekday; p=0.811) or on the secondary end-points. There was a significant decrease over time in
physical activity (p<0.001), lung function (p<0.001) and mastery (p=0.017), but not in functional exercise
capacity (p=0.585).
Although functional exercise capacity did not deteriorate, our mHealth intervention did not improve or
maintain physical activity in patients with COPD after a period of pulmonary rehabilitation.

### Introduction
Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) demonstrate reduced daily physical activity
compared to healthy age-matched controls [1]. Both the amount and intensity of physical activity is reduced

[2] and data suggest that the physical activity of patients is reduced early in the course of the disease [3].
Physical inactivity worsens over time [4], has important clinical consequences and undoubtedly complicates
the course of the disease [3, 5].

Functional exercise capacity is known to improve in COPD patients during a pulmonary rehabilitation
programme [6], but this effect declines over time [7] when patients do not continue to exercise after
completing the programme [8].

The effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on physical activity yields inconsistent results [3, 6]. A 24-week course
of pulmonary rehabilitation seems beneficial compared with 12 weeks, and an exercise programme lasting
18 months resulted in greater improvements than a 12-week programme [9, 10]. However, most pulmonary
rehabilitation programmes only last for 8–12 weeks [11] and structured aftercare programmes are often lacking

[5]. Hence there is a need for effective interventions aiming to improve, and subsequently maintain, physical
activity in patients with COPD during, and particularly after, pulmonary rehabilitation [12]. Of the various
interventions aimed to prolong the beneficial effects of pulmonary rehabilitation none have unequivocally
been shown to work [13]. There is some evidence that health technology can help to facilitate change in
physical activity behaviour [14]. It is expected that the developments in information and communication
technology and the proficiency of future patients will have a significant impact [5], making mobile (m)Health
support programmes accessible to patients. The inclusion of accelerometers in mobile phones and the
increasing availability of mobile technology further facilitates such developments.

This study aims to test the efficacy of a previously developed mHealth intervention [15] in a randomised
controlled trial. The primary aim is to study whether this mHealth intervention, started after discharge
from a 12-week pulmonary rehabilitation programme, will enhance or maintain physical activity compared
to usual care in patients with COPD. The secondary aim is to study whether these improvements would
affect functional exercise capacity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and body mass index (BMI).

### Methods
Design
This was a multicentre, investigator-blinded, randomised controlled trial with an intervention duration of
6 months. Participants were randomised into an intervention or usual care group. All participants gave
written informed consent and continued to receive usual care according to the guidelines of the Dutch
College of General Practitioners [16]. The study was approved by the Utrecht medical ethical research
board (research protocol 11/279).

Participants
Physiotherapists in primary care physiotherapy practices with expertise in COPD were recruited at random
throughout the Netherlands via the Utrecht network for COPD physiotherapists and an advertisement in a
national physiotherapy journal (FysioPraxis). The physiotherapists subsequently recruited patients from
their practice that were diagnosed with COPD, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
(GOLD) stage 2 or 3 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 30–<80%, FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC)
<70% after bronchodilatation), aged ⩾40 years, who had completed a pulmonary rehabilitation programme
of 3 months within the past 6 months and lived independently. Patients were not included in the trial if
they were suffering from a comorbidity that greatly influences physical activity, using an assistive device
for physical activity (e.g. walker or mobility scooter), intermittently ceased the pulmonary rehabilitation
programme and/or experienced an exacerbation resulting in a hospital admission in the 6 months prior to
the commencement of the study.

Randomisation and intervention
The patients included in the study were randomly assigned to the intervention or usual care group,
independent of physiotherapy practice, based on a random number sequence generated in Excel (Microsoft,
Redmond, WA, USA) before enrolment. These numbers ranged between 0 and 1. The values were
categorised into 0 (usual care) and 1 (intervention), based on a ⩾0.5 threshold. Subsequently, each newly
recruited participant was given the first available number and enrolled in the corresponding group. Patients
with and without long-term physiotherapy after pulmonary rehabilitation (some form of continued, though
significantly reduced, supervised exercise training for 1–2 sessions a week versus no physiotherapy
continuance) were separately randomised via stratification, because this was seen as a confounder.

All subjects received individual face-to-face (and written) instructions on the design of the study. Subjects
in the usual care group solely performed the assessments at the four measurement time points.


-----

The intervention consisted of two components: 1) a smartphone application (online supplementary figure S1)
and 2) a website for the physiotherapists (online supplementary figure S2) [15]. The application showed
physical activity in real time in quantitative and qualitative form, measured by the accelerometer embedded in
the smartphone (HTC desire A8181; HTC, Taoyuan, Taiwan). Subjects were persuaded to achieve their
personalised physical activity goal by automated persuasive messages and an emoticon (pictorial
representation of an emotion). The physiotherapists could monitor their patients via the (secure) website,
which showed both the physical activity data from all the participants from their practice and a more detailed
view of individual patients. The physiotherapist was able to adjust each patient’s physical activity goal and
send group or individual text messages. No automated adjustments of the physical activity goal were
performed. Physiotherapists received individual face-to-face (and written) instruction on the functionalities of
the website.

The intervention group received a smartphone, a phone/internet contract and an individual face-to-face (and
written) instruction on the use of the smartphone and the application. The subjects in the intervention
group were instructed to wear the smartphone in a pouch on their belt and use it as their usual phone.
Those subjects in the possession of mobile phones were asked to transfer their SIM (subscriber identification
module) card into the study smartphone. For the first week of the study, physical activity goals were not set,
and subjects were instructed to perform their day-to-day activities as usual. Afterwards, initial personal
physical activity goals were calculated using data from this baseline week as follows. 1) Average steps per day
+20% as daily step goal; 2) daily, the number of steps during the 30 most intensive minutes were counted
and averaged into a value for a week. This latter value +20% was set as the minimum required number of
steps in 1 min to account for an intensive minute of physical activity; and 3) 30 intensive minutes performed
per day, according to the Dutch healthy exercise norm [17]. After this initial physical activity goal setting,
physiotherapists were given responsibility for physical activity goal adjustment. They could reduce or
increase the amount and intensity of the physical activity goal via the website, based on the individual ability
of their patient over time.

Assessments
Measurement time points were at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months (T0, T3, T6 and T12, respectively). Assessments
were performed by two researchers that were blinded to the group allocation.

Lung function
FEV1 and FVC were measured using a Spiromed 2000 (Medikro, Finland). Spirometry was performed
according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines [18], and the results were
compared to normal values of QUANJER et al. [19].

Functional exercise capacity
The modified 6-min walk test (6MWT) was performed on a 10-m course using methodology suggested for
primary care [20]. 6MWTs were performed twice at each measurement time point (with a period of rest
in between), and the best score was used for analysis. The results were expressed as percentage of the
predicted normal values for the Dutch population [21].

HRQoL
Subjects completed the self-administered standardised chronic respiratory questionnaire (CRQ-SAS). The
questionnaire has been found to be a reproducible, reliable and stable measure of health status [22]. In
addition, it has been found to be reliable and valid in the Dutch language [23].

Physical activity
Each subject was provided with an accelerometer validated in patients with COPD (SenseWear PRO or
MF-SW mini armband; Body Media, Pittsburgh, USA) [24]. This device was worn according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Subjects were asked to wear the armband during waking hours (except for
water-related activities) for seven successive days after each measurement time point.

Physical activity was analysed using proprietary software (SenseWear version 7.1).

BMI
Height was measured only at baseline. Weight was measured at all visits.

Weather
For each assessment, humidity, atmospheric pressure and temperature of a meteorological point nearest to
[the location of the physiotherapy practice were noted from a Dutch meteorological website (http://archive-](http://archive-nl.com/page/1421607/2013-02-17/http://www.meteo24.nl/nl/index.php?go=6,1)

Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics include the mean±SD or frequency, where appropriate. Power calculations revealed the
need for 70–80 subjects per group to be sufficient to achieve satisfactory power (online supplementary
material A).

Average steps per weekday was the main outcome measure and was computed as suggested by DEMEYER et
al. [25]. Using repeated measures linear mixed modelling (LMM), we assessed the differences between
groups, the effects of measurement time points and whether group differences were dependent on
measurement time points (group by time interaction). If this latter group by time interaction is not
significant, then the development of the outcome measure over time is similar in both groups, and there is
no effect of the intervention. The chosen approach was a random intercept, random slope method with an
unstructured covariance matrix. The primary explanatory parameters were the measurement time points
(T0–12) and the group allocation (intervention/usual care). These two parameters constitute the basic
model. Subsequently, other parameters were added to see if they improved the model. Online
supplementary material B describes the LMM analysis in more detail. This analysis process was repeated
with the 6-min walking distance (6MWD), average metabolic equivalent of task (METs), CRQ-SAS
outcomes and BMI as outcome measures.

Adherence to the intervention was measured as the percentage of days the intervention was used, and as
percentage of days the physical activity goal was obtained. Analyses were performed using SPSS for
Windows (IBM, PASW Statistics, version 23.0, Chicago, IL, USA).

### Results
157 subjects started the study, and 121 subjects completed all four measurements (figure 1). Subjects were
recruited from 32 physiotherapy practices throughout the Netherlands; 14 within and 18 outside the
province of Utrecht. Baseline characteristics of the subjects in the intervention and usual care groups are
presented in table 1. Results on weather are presented in online supplementary material C.

The average personal physical activity goal was 6124±2819 steps per day at the start of the study and
5968±2442 steps per day at the end of the intervention period. The intervention was used on 89±18.5% of
the study days. The personal physical activity goal was obtained on 34±16% of these days (figure 2). On
average, subjects achieved 10±25% steps per day less than indicated in their physical activity goal.
Physiotherapists sent 362 personal and 10 group messages to their patients. The patients returned 162
messages to the physiotherapists. In the intervention group, FEV1 decreased at an average of 56 mL over the
1-year follow-up period (p=0.162) and 98 mL in the usual care group (p=0.001). There was no group by
time interaction (p=0.508), meaning that the decline in FEV1 over time was not significantly different
between the groups.

The effect sizes of the measurement time points and added parameters that significantly improved the
models are presented in online supplementary material C. Table 2 shows the results of the LMM analyses
for the outcome measures (additional information on the outcomes is shown in online supplementary
table S11).

Primary outcome
On average, subjects wore the armband for 6.6±0.76 days per week. Overall, physical activity as assessed by
steps per weekday decreased over time (p<0.001), but no group by time interaction (p=0.811) nor group
effect was observed (p=0.934). These data show that both groups declined over time in a similar way (figure 3).
There was no group by time interaction between subjects receiving long-term physiotherapy after
pulmonary rehabilitation and those subjects without long-term physiotherapy (p=0.266), meaning that this
did not have any effect on the results in this study.

There was no significant decrease in average METs over time (p=0.07) and no differences between the
groups (p=0.22). The group by time interaction was also nonsignificant (p=0.36).

Secondary outcomes
Functional exercise capacity
The 6MWD did not show a significant group by time interaction (p=0.585), significant decrease over time
(p=0.53), nor group effect (p=0.485).

HRQoL
Only fatigue showed a significant group by time interaction, whereas the other variables did not. However,
this was probably caused by great variability in the data rather than the intervention (figure 4). No
significant differences were found between the groups at each individual measurement time point for

(p=0.04) and T6 (p=0.02) compared with T12. Mastery significantly diminished over time (p=0.017), but
fatigue did not. There were no significant group differences for all CRQ-SAS outcomes.

BMI
The group by time interaction of BMI was not significant. BMI was significantly higher at T6 (p=0.02),
but this was not clinically relevant. There were no differences between the groups.

### Discussion
The present study shows that an mHealth intervention using a smartphone with support from a primary
care physiotherapist did not improve or maintain physical activity in patients with COPD following
pulmonary rehabilitation. In addition, the intervention did not affect functional exercise capacity, HRQoL
outcomes (dyspnoea, fatigue, mastery and emotional function) or BMI. Our hypothesis that subjects in the
intervention group would improve or maintain their physical activity through the benefit of real-time
physical activity biofeedback, goal setting and motivational support from their physiotherapist could not

be confirmed. We found nine other studies that examined the effect of personalised feedback based on
real-time objective data on physical activity in patients with COPD [12, 26–31]. All studies used external
pedometers as a source of feedback on physical activity, and most of these studies were pilot studies with a
short duration of intervention, which makes it difficult to draw any evidence-based conclusions on their
long-term effectiveness. There were two larger studies with a long-term follow-up [32, 33]. Although both
studies showed short-term effects, these were not maintained at the 1-year assessment. Physical activity

level in COPD is consistently associated with mortality and exacerbations [34], stressing the importance of
continuation of studies that are finding ways to improve or maintain physical activity in this patient group.

Potential reasons for ineffectiveness of the intervention
Smartphone as an interface and as a pedometer
Adherence in wearing the smartphone was high, at 89%. However, on average, subjects only obtained their
physical activity goal on 34% of the days they wore the smartphone and came 10% short of their physical
activity goal throughout the intervention period. The interface of the smartphone to provide feedback
intermediately on the actual physical activity level may not have been optimal, or its accuracy may have
been insufficient. This could have reduced the motivation of subjects to adhere to the physical activity
goal. Other forms of eHealth, such as telehealthcare, might offer better results with respect to physical
activity. However, this remains unclear, as the heterogeneity of studies is high and only few report on
physical activity outcomes [35].


Involvement of physiotherapists
Physiotherapists were instructed to monitor patients, send stimulating text messages or adjust physical
activity goals when necessary. However, patients might have received insufficient support from their

physiotherapists to adhere to the personalised physical activity goals. For example, physiotherapists did not
send a lot of stimulating text messages. However, when indicators of website usage and physiotherapist
characteristics were added to the LMM analyses, the model did not improve significantly (online
supplementary material B). Furthermore, there was no difference in steps per weekday between subjects
with long-term physiotherapy after pulmonary rehabilitation, thus receiving more attention from their
physiotherapist, and those without long-term physiotherapy.

With a complex disease such as COPD, mHealth interventions could be a valuable addition to the
multidisciplinary care offered to patients. Strong self-management skills, including the ability to act on
incentives, could improve the efficacy of these interventions. Digital skills and the aid of healthcare
practitioners would also help in this regard. It is possible that a large number of subjects in this study might
have lacked the skill-set needed to fully benefit from our mHealth intervention. It might be interesting to see
if these skill-sets can be measured in individual patients and taught in a personally tailored form. Learning
self-management skills only during pulmonary rehabilitation does not seem to be sufficient [6], thus we
should pay attention to how these skills can be maintained in the long-term. It is nevertheless plausible that
during the pulmonary rehabilitation programme, time could be set aside to learn how to use the mHealth
application and take appropriate actions when prompted. This was not done in the present study.

Subject selection
The intervention might have yielded different results in patients that did not complete a pulmonary
rehabilitation programme. As there could be more room for improvement, physical activity levels could have
increased. This has been shown in previous pedometer studies [12, 31]. Nevertheless, as the intervention was
not successful in maintaining physical activity in patients after pulmonary rehabilitation, the question
remains whether it is capable of improving physical activity in patients without pulmonary rehabilitation.

Physical activity decreased significantly over time, as did lung function and mastery. Physical activity
decreased on average by 889 steps per weekday over the 1-year duration of the study, which is more than
double what was found in previous reports [4]. It is possible that patients had increased their physical
activity by the end of the 3-month outpatient rehabilitation programme preceding the study [25] and
subsequently decreased their activity back to their pre-rehabilitation physical activity. In any case, our
intervention could not prevent this from happening. A study that followed patients over 12 months after a
pulmonary rehabilitation programme showed that, as in our study, physical activity declined. Past exercise
habits, 6MWD and barriers to exercise were determinants that discriminated between patients that
declined significantly during follow-up, and those that remained at a high or a low activity level [36].
These outcomes might be able to discriminate between patients that are in need of additional attention
from a physiotherapist and patients that are able to maintain their physical activity with less support.

Surprisingly, functional exercise capacity remained unchanged over the study duration of 1 year. This is in
contrast to other studies where the 6MWD deteriorated over time in post-rehabilitation COPD patients [37–39].
Our results indicate that subjects remained at the same capacity level, but became less active during daily life;
this holds true for patients with and without long-term physiotherapy after pulmonary rehabilitation.

eHealth is a relatively new area in healthcare, and it has many potential benefits. Nonetheless, this study
shows that in a population of patients with COPD, mHealth interventions are not always effective and
expectations have to be adjusted. Future studies should try to identify those factors that influence the
usability and efficacy of mHealth interventions. It is not only important to look at disease-specific factors,
but also at individual factors, as the population of COPD patients comprises a wide variety of persons with
varying needs, abilities and wishes.

Limitations
Subjects
Drop-out in the intervention group was higher (39% in the intervention group versus 27% in the usual
care group), and it was also higher among females. Initial worries about the telephone contract (linked to
a personal bank account) and fear of losing the device were reasons for patients to drop out of the study.
After the consent form was adjusted to state explicitly that there would not be any financial ramifications,
the drop-out rate decreased.

There were patients who still had trouble using the smartphone, even after the individual face-to-face (and
written) instructions and the availability of a helpdesk. Because smartphones are becoming more common,
this will probably be less of a problem in the future.

Patients with GOLD stage 4 disease were not included in the study, resulting in a sample not fully similar
to other pulmonary rehabilitation studies. This was because their low physical activity level renders an
intervention effect improbable.

Physiotherapists
After initial instruction, the physiotherapists were no longer prompted to use the mHealth intervention
(they did have access to a help centre). This was by design to see how the intervention would work in
practice. As an indication, physiotherapists were told to monitor the website at least once a week. Multiple
instructions/more prompting might have increased monitoring/stimulation from physiotherapists and,
subsequently, positively influenced patient outcomes.

The present study was set up in primary care and did not measure outcomes at the start of the pulmonary
rehabilitation programme. This makes it difficult to compare the decline in physical activity with the
potentially beneficial effects of the preceding pulmonary rehabilitation programme.

Conclusion
Compared to usual care, no differences were observed in physical activity, functional exercise capacity,
HRQoL outcomes or BMI in patients with COPD using a consumer smartphone-based mHealth intervention
geared to enhance physical activity with support from a primary care physiotherapist following pulmonary
rehabilitation. There was a significant decrease over time in physical activity, mastery and lung function, but
not in functional exercise capacity. Our mHealth intervention did not succeed in enabling patients with
COPD to prevent a decrease in physical activity.
