Abstract
Background: The World Health Organization has projected that by 2030, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will
be the third-leading cause of mortality and the seventh-leading cause of morbidity worldwide. Acute exacerbations of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are associated with an accelerated decline in lung function, diminished quality of life,
and higher mortality. Accurate early detection of acute exacerbations will enable early management and reduce mortality.
Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a prediction system using lifestyle data, environmental factors, and patient
symptoms for the early detection of AECOPD in the upcoming 7 days.
Methods: This prospective study was performed at National Taiwan University Hospital. Patients with COPD that did not have
a pacemaker and were not pregnant were invited for enrollment. Data on lifestyle, temperature, humidity, and fine particulate
matter were collected using wearable devices (Fitbit Versa), a home air quality–sensing device (EDIMAX Airbox), and a
smartphone app. AECOPD episodes were evaluated via standardized questionnaires. With these input features, we evaluated the
prediction performance of machine learning models, including random forest, decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant
analysis, and adaptive boosting, and a deep neural network model.
Results: The continuous real-time monitoring of lifestyle and indoor environment factors was implemented by integrating home
air quality–sensing devices, a smartphone app, and wearable devices. All data from 67 COPD patients were collected prospectively
during a mean 4-month follow-up period, resulting in the detection of 25 AECOPD episodes. For 7-day AECOPD prediction,
the proposed AECOPD predictive model achieved an accuracy of 92.1%, sensitivity of 94%, and specificity of 90.4%. Receiver
operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the area under the curve of the model in predicting AECOPD was greater
than 0.9. The most important variables in the model were daily steps walked, stairs climbed, and daily distance moved.
Conclusions: Using wearable devices, home air quality–sensing devices, a smartphone app, and supervised prediction algorithms,
we achieved excellent power to predict whether a patient would experience AECOPD within the upcoming 7 days. The AECOPD
prediction system provided an effective way to collect lifestyle and environmental data, and yielded reliable predictions of future
AECOPD events. Compared with previous studies, we have comprehensively improved the performance of the AECOPD
prediction model by adding objective lifestyle and environmental data. This model could yield more accurate prediction results
for COPD patients than using only questionnaire data.
