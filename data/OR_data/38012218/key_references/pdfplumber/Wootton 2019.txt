Abstract
This multi-centred, randomised controlled trial explored the effects of adding ongoing feedback to a 12-month unsupervised
maintenance walking program, on daily physical activity (PA) in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Partici-
pants were randomised to either an intervention group (IG) or a usual care group (UCG). During the maintenance program,
the IG received ongoing feedback (telephone calls, biofeedback provided via pedometer and progressive goal setting) and
the UCG received no feedback. The SenseWear® Pro3 Armband was used to measure PA. Of the 86 participants {IG = 42,
(mean [SD]: age 70 [7] years; F EV 43 [16] % predicted); UCG = 44, (age 69 [9] years; F EV 44 [15] % predicted)} included

at baseline, 43 had sufficient data to be included in the final analysis. There were no between-group differences in any of the
PA variables from baseline to completion of the program (all p > 0.05). Ongoing feedback was no more effective than no
feedback in improving PA during a 12-month unsupervised walking program.
Trial Registration: The trial was registered in the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry
(ACTRN12609000472279).
