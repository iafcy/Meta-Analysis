ABSTRACT Physical inactivity is a cardinal feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Pedometers, which have been used in healthy
populations,mightalsoincreasephysicalactivityinpatientswithCOPD.
COPD patients taking part in a 3-month individualised programme to promote an increase in their
dailyphysicalactivitywererandomisedtoeitherastandardprogrammeofphysicalactivityencouragement
alone, or a pedometer-based programme. Assessments were performed by investigators blinded to
treatment allocation. Change in average 1-week daily step count, 6-min walking distance (6MWD),
modified Medical Research Council scale, St George’s respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) and COPD
assessmenttest (CAT)werecomparedbetweengroups.
102 patients were recruited, of whom 97 completed the programme (pedometer group: n=50; control

Introduction
Physicalinactivityisacardinalfeatureofchronicobstructivepulmonarydisease(COPD)[1].Patientswith
theconditiondisplayasignificantreductionintheir levelofphysicalactivityevenat relativelyearlystages
[2–5], and there is evidence that physical inactivity is independently associated with dyspnoea, quality of
life, lung function decline, muscle strength and endurance, the frequency of acute exacerbations and
mortality in COPD [1, 6–10]. International guidelines recommend that all COPD patients should receive
advicetowalkfor30mineachday[11],butadvicealonehaslimitedimpactonsedentarybehaviour[12].
Pulmonary rehabilitation is known to improve exercise capacity [13, 14], but there are two important
issues. First, access to this form of treatment remains limited because of resource constraints that
particularly limit its possible application in patients with less severe disease and secondly, its effects on
daily physical activity may be limited and short lived [15]. Therefore, there is a need to find additional
effective and scalable interventions that are cheap to implement and which can improve physical activity
levelinCOPDpatients[9].
Pedometers can provide feedback to patients about their daily activity, and have been promoted as
effective tools to monitor and increase physical activity levels in healthy populations [12], but it is not
known if they are effective tools to improve physical activity levels in COPD patients. The aim of this
randomised controlled trial was, therefore, to determine if a 3 month pedometer-based programme could
be useful to increase daily step count in stable outpatients with COPD. Secondary outcomes were health
statusandexercisecapacity.
Methods
Subjects
The study was a parallel group, assessor-blind, randomised controlled trial conducted at Hospital Clínico
Universidad de Chile (Santiago, Chile) between December 2010 and January 2012. Patients with COPD,
diagnosed according to the 2006 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)
guidelines [16], aged ⩾40 years, with a smoking history of ⩾10 pack-years and who had quit at least
2 monthsprior to recruitment and who hadhad no exacerbation in the preceding 4 weeks were recruited
from the outpatient clinics at private and public hospitals, private clinics and from public primary health
centres in Santiago. Patients were excluded if they had any other chronic condition that significantly
interferedwiththeirabilitytowalkoriftheyhadparticipatedinapulmonaryrehabilitationprogrammein
the previousyear. The institutional ethics committee approved the protocol and subjects provided written
informed consent prior to participation. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier
NCT01739751)andapreliminaryreportincluding55subjectshasbeenpublishedinSpanish[17].
Protocol
All study visits were conducted at the Hospital Clínico Universidad de Chile. Following their baseline
assessments, patients attended monthly for 3 months. Counselling was delivered by the patients’
physicians and a physiotherapist and each session lasted ∼30 min. Consecutive patients who consented to
participate were randomly assigned to one of two groups, “control” or “pedometer”, by the investigators
based on a random number sequence generated in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) before
enrolmentcommenced.
Patients assigned to the control group received counselling at each visit to increase their physical activity
levelandwereadvisedtowalkforatleast30minperday.Theywereprovidedwithadiaryandinstructed
to record information related to their condition each day (see supplementary material). Patients brought
thediarytoeachmonthlyappointment.
Patients allocated to the pedometer group received a PD724 Triaxial pedometer (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan)
and were instructed how to use it. They were encouraged to be more active by using the pedometer to
measure the number of steps walked daily and to record this in the diary provided, together with any
information related to their clinical condition. This diary was the same as for the control group with the
exception of an additional column for the step count. Patients were asked to bring both the pedometer

and the diary to each monthly appointment. The Tanita PD724 pedometer displays a cumulative step
count foreach dayand also retainsthe step counts from the preceding 7 days in its memoryallowing the
average step count for the preceding week to be evaluated. Based on this, patients then received a task to
increasetheirstepsperdaybythenextappointmentfollowingaspecificprotocol(table1).Thiscontinued
foreachofthe3monthsoffollow-up.
On each occasion, all participants were advised to continue with non-pharmacological and
pharmacologicaltreatmentsprovidedbytheirownhealthcentres.
Assessments
At the beginning and end of the study, the following were assessed: anthropometrics; spirometry [18];
dyspnoea using the modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale [19]; quality of life according to
the St George’s respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) [20] and the COPD assessment test score (CAT) [21];
and exercise capacity according to the 6-min walking test (6MWT) [22]. The primary end-point in the
study was change in the daily step count, based on an average step count of 7 days obtained using the
sameTanitaPD724pedometer,whichwasgiventopatientsaftertheirbaselineand3-monthvisit.Forthis
baseline and final assessment period only, the screen was obscured by masking tape, so that the number
displayed would not influence behaviour. The tape was signed so that it would be obvious if it had been
tampered with. Secondary end-points were change in health status (SGRQ and CAT) and change in
exercisecapacity(6MWT)comparedbetweengroups.
Using datafromthe patient diaries, theincidence of acute exacerbationsof COPD (AECOPD), defined as
an acute event with a change in respiratory symptoms that required treatment with antibiotics and/or
systemic steroids, was determined [11]. All assessments were made by technicians of the pulmonary
function laboratory at Hospital Clínico Universidad de Chile, who were blinded to the allocation of the
patients.

An additional finding was that a significantly higher proportion of COPD patients in the control group

thestudy(p=0.03).
Discussion
The main finding of this randomised controlled trial was that, in patients with COPD, a programme of
advice alone had no impact on physical activity, whereas a pedometer-based programme produced

Significanceoffindings
Formal pulmonary rehabilitation programmes have a strong evidence base for improving exercise capacity
andhealthstatusinCOPD[13,14],buttheevidencethattheyleadtosustainedimprovementsinphysical
activity level is not as strong [1, 15, 26] and the benefits are known to wane with time [27]. Moreover,
resource considerations mean that access to pulmonary rehabilitation is limited for many patients with
COPD[28],asitinvolvesaninterdisciplinaryprofessionalteam[29]andrequiresfacilitiestoexercisetwo
tothree times perweek for6–12 weeks,with estimatedcosts of$1000perpatient [30].The presentstudy

In general, pedometers are developed as consumer devices and are therefore cheap and user-friendly. The
programme described required only monthly appointments at the health centre. Pedometers could of
coursebeusedasanadjuncttopulmonaryrehabilitationandarecentpublishedstudyfoundsomebenefit
of adding pedometers as an incentive to exercise in the context of a formal pulmonary rehabilitation
programme [31]. PUENTE-MAESTU et al. [32] compared supervised training on a treadmill four times per
weekor walking 3 or 4km in1h4 days per week, self-monitored with apedometer, with weekly visitsto
encourage adherence in 42 patients (mean forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) 41% predicted) and

visitsandbecausethepedometerswereusedtoconfirmcompliancewiththeprescribedwalksonly,rather
than as an incentive to influence day to day activity more generally. HOSPES et al. [33] randomised 35
patients (mean FEV1 65% predicted) to usual care or a pedometer-based activity programme combined
with five exercise counselling sessions over 12 weeks, which led to an improvement in dailystep count of
∼10%. Regular phone calls have also been shown to be effective in motivating patients with more severe
COPD to increase their level of home-based physical activity [34]. New technologies may have a role. A

nourstudy,most ofthepatientshadmildormoderateCOPDbasedonairflowobstruction,socautionis
needed when extrapolating the findings to more severe disease. The demonstration that behaviourchange
is possible does support the importance of case finding for COPD to identify people at an earlier stage
[5, 37]. Patients with COPD often present with advanced disease [27] and, as well as having more severe
respiratory compromise, by this point their physical condition is also impaired due to the cumulative
effectsofyearsofphysicalinactivity.
An interesting observation, although not the focus of the study, was the finding that there were
significantly fewer exacerbations in the pedometer group. An association between physical activity level
and exacerbations has been noted previously, with possible mechanisms including anti-inflammatory and
anti-oxidant effects, as well as change in perceived symptom thresholds [1, 9, 38–40]. If future studies

confirmthisitwouldprovidefurtherevidenceofthevalueofthisformofinterventionandcouldsupport
the concept that relatively early intervention to increase physical activity in COPD patients is disease
modifying[9].
Methodologicalissues
Although patients could not be blinded to their treatment allocation, a strength of this study wasthat the
technicians responsible for the baseline and final measurements were blinded to patient allocation. In
addition,fortheprimaryend-point,thepedometerdisplaywascoveredtoensurethatitdidnotinfluence
behaviour. Both groups received the same amount of face to face contact, meaning that differences
between groups were not due to different levels of input from health professionals but rather were related
to the specific nature of the intervention; a pedometerand instructionsto increase dailystep count rather
than general advice to be more active with the aim of walking for at least 30min per day. We speculate
that the substantial effect on step count was due to this combination of the face to face nature of the
intervention with time taken to demonstrate and reinforce device use, together with explaining the
rationaleforincreasedphysicalactivityandthedailyreinforcementofferedbythedevice.
TheTanitaPD724pedometerwaschosenbasedontheresearchteam’spracticalexperienceofitsusability.
It is tri-axial so can be worn in the pocket. On board processing requires movement to persist for 7s
before it is accepted as walking and added to the step total. It has not been formally validated in COPD
and like othercommercial devices it may not record low intensity steps as effectively. Since our intention
wastoincreasepurposeful,sustainedwalkingthisisnotasignificantissue.
Although statistically significant, changes observed in the 6MWD between groups did not reach the
minimum clinically important difference, in contrast to the effect on health status. This could be due to a
ceilingeffect.TherewereahighproportionofpatientsinGOLDstageIandIIwhichmeantthattheaverage
6MWDwas>460minbothgroups,abovethethresholdintheBODE(bodymassindex,airflowobstruction,
dyspnoea, exercise capacity) score classification [41], which has no impact on prognosis. In addition,
researchers did not give instructions about the speed of walking; the task was focused to only gradually
increasethenumberofstepswalkeddaily.Thisunderlinesthatthissortofinterventionshouldbeconsidered
complementary to exercise training and pulmonary rehabilitation rather than an alternative, particularly in
thosewithmoreseveredisease.Essentially,apedometer-basedphysicalactivityprogrammecouldhavearole
inpatientswithdiseaseusuallynotconsideredtobesevereenoughforpulmonaryrehabilitation,forpatients
where pulmonary rehabilitation programmes are not available or have long waiting lists and also as an
adjuncttopulmonaryrehabilitationinordertoenhanceandsustainbehaviourchange.
The data presented here only describe the effect of a 3-month programme so longer term studies are
necessary. Patients rapidly became used to the programme, and based on the pattern of increase in step
count, which appeared to be plateauing by 3 months (fig. 3), we speculate that over the longer term less
frequentvisitsforreinforcementwouldbeneeded.
Conclusion
This study demonstratesthat apedometer-based programmecan have a dramatic impact onpatients with
earlyCOPD,increasingphysicalactivitylevelandenhancingqualityoflife.
