A randomised controlled trial was performed in 32 physiotherapy practices in the Netherlands. COPD
patients were randomised into intervention or usual care groups. The intervention consisted of a
smartphone application for the patients and a monitoring website for the physiotherapists. Measurements
were performed at 0, 3, 6 and 12months. Physical activity, functional exercise capacity, lung function,
health-relatedqualityoflifeandbodymassindexwereassessed.
157 patients started the study and 121 completed it. There were no significant positive effects of the

Introduction
Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) demonstrate reduced daily physical activity
comparedtohealthyage-matchedcontrols[1].Boththeamountandintensityofphysicalactivityisreduced
[2] and data suggest that the physical activity of patients is reduced early in the course of the disease [3].
Physicalinactivityworsensovertime[4],hasimportantclinicalconsequencesandundoubtedlycomplicates
thecourseofthedisease[3,5].
Functional exercise capacity is known to improve in COPD patients during a pulmonary rehabilitation
programme [6], but this effect declines over time [7] when patients do not continue to exercise after
completingtheprogramme[8].
Theeffectofpulmonaryrehabilitationonphysicalactivityyieldsinconsistentresults[3,6].A24-weekcourse
of pulmonary rehabilitation seems beneficial compared with 12weeks, and an exercise programme lasting
18months resulted in greater improvementsthan a 12-week programme [9, 10]. However, most pulmonary
rehabilitationprogrammesonlylastfor8–12weeks[11]andstructuredaftercareprogrammesareoftenlacking
[5].Hencethereisaneedforeffectiveinterventionsaimingtoimprove,andsubsequentlymaintain,physical
activity in patients with COPD during, and particularly after, pulmonary rehabilitation [12]. Of the various
interventions aimed to prolong the beneficial effects of pulmonary rehabilitation none have unequivocally
been shown to work [13]. There is some evidence that health technology can help to facilitate change in
physical activity behaviour [14]. It is expected that the developments in information and communication
technologyandtheproficiencyoffuturepatientswillhaveasignificantimpact [5],makingmobile(m)Health
support programmes accessible to patients. The inclusion of accelerometers in mobile phones and the
increasingavailabilityofmobiletechnologyfurtherfacilitatessuchdevelopments.
This study aims to test the efficacy of a previously developed mHealth intervention [15] in a randomised
controlled trial. The primary aim is to study whether this mHealth intervention, started after discharge
froma12-weekpulmonaryrehabilitationprogramme,willenhanceormaintainphysicalactivitycompared
to usual care in patients with COPD. The secondary aim is to study whether these improvements would
affectfunctionalexercisecapacity,health-relatedqualityoflife(HRQoL)andbodymassindex(BMI).
Methods
Design
This was a multicentre, investigator-blinded, randomised controlled trial with an intervention duration of
6months. Participants were randomised into an intervention or usual care group. All participants gave
written informed consent and continued to receive usual care according to the guidelines of the Dutch
College of General Practitioners [16]. The study was approved by the Utrecht medical ethical research
board(researchprotocol11/279).

Assessments
Measurement time points were at 0, 3, 6 and 12months (T0, T3, T6 and T12, respectively). Assessments
wereperformedbytworesearchersthatwereblindedtothegroupallocation.
Lungfunction
FEV1 and FVC were measured using a Spiromed 2000 (Medikro, Finland). Spirometry was performed
accordingtoAmericanThoracicSociety/EuropeanRespiratorySocietyguidelines[18],andtheresultswere
comparedtonormalvaluesofQUANJERetal.[19].

Themodified6-minwalktest (6MWT)wasperformedona10-mcourseusingmethodologysuggestedfor
primary care [20]. 6MWTs were performed twice at each measurement time point (with a period of rest
in between), and the best score was used for analysis. The results were expressed as percentage of the
predictednormalvaluesfortheDutchpopulation[21].
HRQoL
Subjects completed the self-administered standardised chronic respiratory questionnaire (CRQ-SAS). The
questionnaire has been found to be a reproducible, reliable and stable measure of health status [22]. In
addition,ithasbeenfoundtobereliableandvalidintheDutchlanguage[23].
Physicalactivity
Each subject was provided with an accelerometer validated in patients with COPD (SenseWear PRO or
MF-SW mini armband; Body Media, Pittsburgh, USA) [24]. This device was worn according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Subjects were asked to wear the armband during waking hours (except for

al. [25]. Using repeated measures linear mixed modelling (LMM), we assessed the differences between
groups, the effects of measurement time points and whether group differences were dependent on
measurement time points (group by time interaction). If this latter group by time interaction is not
significant,thenthedevelopmentoftheoutcomemeasureovertimeissimilarinbothgroups,andthereis

unstructured covariance matrix. The primary explanatory parameters were the measurement time points
(T0–12) and the group allocation (intervention/usual care). These two parameters constitute the basic
model. Subsequently, other parameters were added to see if they improved the model. Online
supplementary material B describes the LMM analysis in more detail. This analysis process was repeated
with the 6-min walking distance (6MWD), average metabolic equivalent of task (METs), CRQ-SAS
outcomesandBMIasoutcomemeasures.
Adherence to the intervention was measured as the percentage of days the intervention was used, and as
percentage of days the physical activity goal was obtained. Analyses were performed using SPSS for
Windows(IBM,PASWStatistics,version23.0,Chicago,IL,USA).
Results
157subjectsstartedthestudy,and121subjectscompletedallfourmeasurements(figure1).Subjectswere
recruited from 32 physiotherapy practices throughout the Netherlands; 14 within and 18 outside the
province of Utrecht. Baseline characteristics of the subjects in the intervention and usual care groups are

The average personal physical activity goal was 6124±2819 steps per day at the start of the study and
5968±2442 steps perdayat theend of the interventionperiod. The interventionwas used on 89±18.5%of
the study days. The personal physical activity goal was obtained on 34±16% of these days (figure 2). On
average, subjects achieved 10±25% steps per day less than indicated in their physical activity goal.
Physiotherapists sent 362 personal and 10 group messages to their patients. The patients returned 162
messagestothephysiotherapists.Intheinterventiongroup,FEV1decreasedatanaverageof56mLoverthe
1-year follow-up period (p=0.162) and 98 mL in the usual care group (p=0.001). There was no group by
time interaction (p=0.508), meaning that the decline in FEV1 over time was not significantly different
betweenthegroups.
The effect sizes of the measurement time points and added parameters that significantly improved the
models are presented in online supplementary material C. Table 2 showsthe results of the LMM analyses

Discussion
The present study shows that an mHealth intervention using a smartphone with support from a primary
care physiotherapist did not improve or maintain physical activity in patients with COPD following
pulmonary rehabilitation. In addition, the intervention did not affect functional exercise capacity, HRQoL
outcomes(dyspnoea,fatigue,masteryandemotionalfunction)orBMI.Ourhypothesisthatsubjectsinthe
intervention group would improve or maintain their physical activity through the benefit of real-time
physical activity biofeedback, goal setting and motivational support from their physiotherapist could not

been insufficient. This could have reduced the motivation of subjects to adhere to the physical activity

physiotherapiststoadheretothepersonalisedphysicalactivitygoals.Forexample,physiotherapistsdidnot
send a lot of stimulating text messages. However, when indicators of website usage and physiotherapist
characteristics were added to the LMM analyses, the model did not improve significantly (online
supplementary material B). Furthermore, there was no difference in steps per weekday between subjects
with long-term physiotherapy after pulmonary rehabilitation, thus receiving more attention from their
physiotherapist,andthosewithoutlong-termphysiotherapy.
Digitalandself-managementskills
With a complex disease such as COPD, mHealth interventions could be a valuable addition to the
multidisciplinary care offered to patients. Strong self-management skills, including the ability to act on
incentives, could improve the efficacy of these interventions. Digital skills and the aid of healthcare
practitionerswouldalsohelpinthisregard.Itispossiblethatalargenumberofsubjectsinthisstudymight
havelackedtheskill-setneededtofullybenefitfromourmHealthintervention.Itmightbeinterestingtosee
iftheseskill-setscanbemeasuredinindividualpatientsandtaught inapersonallytailoredform.Learning
self-management skills only during pulmonary rehabilitation does not seem to be sufficient [6], thus we
shouldpayattentiontohowtheseskillscanbemaintainedinthelong-term.Itisneverthelessplausiblethat
during the pulmonary rehabilitation programme, time could be set aside to learn how to use the mHealth
applicationandtakeappropriateactionswhenprompted.Thiswasnotdoneinthepresentstudy.
Subjectselection
The intervention might have yielded different results in patients that did not complete a pulmonary
rehabilitationprogramme.Astherecouldbemoreroomforimprovement,physicalactivitylevelscouldhave
increased.Thishasbeenshowninpreviouspedometerstudies[12,31].Nevertheless,astheinterventionwas
not successful in maintaining physical activity in patients after pulmonary rehabilitation, the question
remainswhetheritiscapableofimprovingphysicalactivityinpatientswithoutpulmonaryrehabilitation.
Physical activity decreased significantly over time, as did lung function and mastery. Physical activity
decreased on average by 889steps per weekdayover the 1-year duration of the study, which is more than
double what was found in previous reports [4]. It is possible that patients had increased their physical
activity by the end of the 3-month outpatient rehabilitation programme preceding the study [25] and
subsequently decreased their activity back to their pre-rehabilitation physical activity. In any case, our
interventioncouldnotpreventthisfromhappening.Astudythatfollowedpatientsover12monthsaftera
pulmonary rehabilitation programmeshowed that, asin our study, physical activity declined. Past exercise
habits, 6MWD and barriers to exercise were determinants that discriminated between patients that
declined significantly during follow-up, and those that remained at a high or a low activity level [36].
These outcomes might be able to discriminate between patients that are in need of additional attention
fromaphysiotherapistandpatientsthatareabletomaintaintheirphysicalactivitywithlesssupport.
Surprisingly, functional exercise capacity remained unchanged over the study duration of 1year. This is in
contrasttootherstudieswherethe6MWDdeterioratedovertimeinpost-rehabilitationCOPDpatients[37–39].
Ourresultsindicate that subjectsremainedatthesame capacitylevel,but became lessactive duringdailylife;

eHealth is a relatively new area in healthcare, and it has many potential benefits. Nonetheless, this study
shows that in a population of patients with COPD, mHealth interventions are not always effective and
expectations have to be adjusted. Future studies should try to identify those factors that influence the
usabilityand efficacyof mHealth interventions. It is not onlyimportant to look at disease-specific factors,
butalsoatindividualfactors,asthepopulationofCOPDpatientscomprisesawidevarietyofpersonswith
varyingneeds,abilitiesandwishes.
Limitations
Subjects
Drop-out in the intervention group was higher (39% in the intervention group versus 27% in the usual
care group), and it was also higheramong females. Initial worries about the telephone contract (linked to
a personal bank account) and fearof losing the devicewere reasons for patientsto drop out of the study.
After theconsentformwasadjustedtostateexplicitlythattherewould notbeany financial ramifications,
thedrop-outratedecreased.

Patients with GOLDstage 4 diseasewere notincludedinthestudy, resultingina samplenotfullysimilar
to other pulmonary rehabilitation studies. This was because their low physical activity level renders an
interventioneffectimprobable.
Physiotherapists
After initial instruction, the physiotherapists were no longer prompted to use the mHealth intervention
(they did have access to a help centre). This was by design to see how the intervention would work in
practice.Asanindication,physiotherapistsweretoldtomonitorthewebsiteatleastonceaweek.Multiple
instructions/more prompting might have increased monitoring/stimulation from physiotherapists and,
subsequently,positivelyinfluencedpatientoutcomes.
Thepresentstudywassetupinprimarycareanddidnotmeasureoutcomesatthestartofthepulmonary

potentiallybeneficialeffectsoftheprecedingpulmonaryrehabilitationprogramme.
