Introduction
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major health problem and a
leading cause of disability and mortality throughout the
world.1–3
The disease is
characterized by chronic airway inflammation and airflow obstruction that is par-
tially reversible on administration of inhaled bronchodilator therapy. Disease pro-
gression is usually defined by progressive worsening of airflow obstruction or the
