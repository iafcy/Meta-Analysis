statistically significant (p > 0.05 for all). Patients in both groups showed moderate to high
pre-post-changes in terms of secondary outcomes, but no advantage favoring the IG was
found.
Conclusion: The results show that adding a pedometer-based behavioral intervention to
standard German three-week inpatient PR for COPD patients did not result in more physical
activity in terms of steps and moderate-intensity physical activity or less sedentary time.
However, both groups (IG and CG) showed remarkably enhanced physical activity levels six
weeks and six months after PR, as well as improvements in other secondary outcomes (eg,
quality of life).
