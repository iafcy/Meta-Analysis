tation (PR) to PR alone on the C-PPAC scores in COPD patients with low baseline PA levels.
Methods: In this randomised controlled trial, 48 patients (means ±SD: FEV1: 50 ±19%, baseline steps/day: 3450
±2342) were assigned 1:1 to receive PR alone, twice weekly for 8 weeks, or PA behavioural modification in-
terventions (comprising motivational interviews, monitoring and feedback using a pedometer and goal setting)
alongside PR (PR +PA). The C-PPAC instrument was used to assess PA experience, including a perspective of the
amount and difficulty of PA.
Results: There were clinically important improvements in favour of the PR +PA interventions compared to PR
alone in: 1) the C-PPAC total score (mean [95% CI] difference: 8 [4 to 12] points, p =0.001), the difficulty (mean
[95% CI] difference: 8 [3 to 13] points, p =0.002) and the amount (mean [95% CI] difference 8 [3 to 16] points,
p =0.005) domains and 2) the CAT score (mean [95% CI] difference: -2.1 [-3.8 to (cid:0) 0.3] points, p =0.025).
Conclusion: PA behavioural modification interventions alongside PR improve the experiences of PA in patients
with advanced COPD and low baseline PA levels. (NCT03749655).
