Our intervention did not reduce sedentary behaviour as
hypothesized. We anticipated that if patients became
more active, their sedentary time would decrease.31
An explanation for our finding may be that the study inter-
vention was primarily focused on increasing physical activ-
ity, as the target goals were set in steps per day without
objectively monitoring goals on sedentary behaviour. While
it has been shown that sedentary behaviour modification
interventionsalonemightbemoreeffectivethaninconjunc-
tion with physical activity goals,32 there is still no clear evi-
dence regarding this.33 Given the impact of sedentary
behaviour on the course of COPD,34 more studies are
needed to clarify the relationship between physical activity
and sedentary behaviour in patients with COPD to design
betterinterventions.
