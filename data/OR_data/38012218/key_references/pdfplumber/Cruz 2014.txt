Abstract
Thisstudyaimedatinvestigatingwhetherprovidingfeedbackonphysicalactivity(PA)levelstopatientswithchronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is feasible and enhances daily PA during pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).
Patients with COPD participatedin a 12-week PRprogram. Daily PAwas measured using activity monitors on
weeks1,7,and12,andfeedbackwasgiveninthefollowingweeksonthenumberofsteps,timespentinsedentary,
