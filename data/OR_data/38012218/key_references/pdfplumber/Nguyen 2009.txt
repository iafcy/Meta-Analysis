pleted incremental cycle and six minute walk (6MW) tests, wore an activity monitor for 14 days,
and reported their health-related quality of life (HRQL) at baseline, three, and six months.
Results: The sample had a mean age of 68 ± 11 and forced expiratory volume in one second
(FEV) of 40 ± 18% predicted. Participants reported that logging their exercise and symptoms

was easy and that keeping track of their exercise helped them remain active. There were no
differences between groups over time in maximal workload, 6MW distance, or HRQL (p  0.05);
however, MOBILE-Self-Monitored increased total steps/day whereas MOBILE-Coached logged
fewer steps over six months (p = 0.04).
Conclusions: We showed that it is feasible to deliver a cell phone-based exercise persistence
intervention to patients with COPD post-rehabilitation and that the addition of coaching appeared
to be no better than self-monitoring. The latter finding needs to be interpreted with caution since
this was a purely exploratory study.

Background
Exercise is a well established intervention to improve physical functioning, symptoms,
and quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).1
However, patients face multiple barriers to exercise persistence including episodic
exacerbations of their illness, limited ongoing support, and low self-regulatory
capacity.2–4 Supervised exercise training is a cornerstone of pulmonary rehabilitation
