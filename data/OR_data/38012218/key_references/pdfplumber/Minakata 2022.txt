Effects of individualized target setting on step count in Japanese
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a pilot study
Abstract
Introduction: Improving physical activity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a very important issue;
however, effective recommended targets for individual patients remain to be determined.
Material and methods: We developed a method for setting a target value for the step count for each patient using a measured
value and the predicted step count. We then evaluated the effect of providing a pedometer or a pedometer with this target value
for eight weeks on the step count in patients with COPD.
Results: Sixteen stable COPD patients were included in the analysis. Overall, no significant increase in the step count was ob-
tained by providing the target value; however, when the patients were divided into two groups based on the median step count
at baseline, a significant increase in the step count was observed in the low step-count group. In both the overall population and
the low step-count group, there was a significant increase in the target achievement rate in patients who received a pedometer
with a target value in comparison to patients who were given a pedometer without a target value.
Conclusions: Physical activity may be improved by providing a newly developed individual target step count to COPD patients
with a low step count at baseline.
Key words: physical activity, step count, target value
