ABSTRACT There is a need to increase and maintain physical activity in patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We assessed 12-month efficacy and effectiveness of the Urban
TraininginterventiononphysicalactivityinCOPDpatients.
This randomised controlled trial (NCT01897298) allocated 407 COPD patients from primary and
hospital settings 1:1 to usual care (n=205) or Urban Training (n=202). Urban Training consisted of a
baseline motivational interview, advice to walk on urban trails designed for COPD patients in outdoor
public spaces and other optional components for feedback, motivation, information and support
(pedometer, calendar, physical activity brochure, website, phone text messages, walking groups and a
phonenumber).Theprimaryoutcomewas12-monthchangeinsteps·day−1measuredbyaccelerometer.
Efficacy analysis (with per-protocol analysis set, n=233 classified as adherent to the assigned
intervention)showedadjusted(95%CI)12-monthdifference+957(184–1731)steps·day−1betweenUrban
Training and usual care. Effectiveness analysis (with intention-to-treat analysis set, n=280 patients

no differences between groups. Leg muscle pain during walks was more frequently reported in Urban

Introduction
Patientswithchronicobstructivepulmonarydisease(COPD)aresubstantiallylessactivethantheirhealthy
peers [1] and this inactivity has been consistently related to a worse prognosis of the disease [2]. Thus,
helpingpatientstoadoptamoreactivelifestyleisamajorgoalinCOPDmanagement.Unfortunately,how
toproduceandmaintainsuchbehaviouralchangeremainsachallenge[3,4].
Based on the beneficial effects of behavioural strategies on changing physical activity in patients with
chronic diseases [5], recent COPD studies have focused on these kinds of interventions. Some of them,
including physical activity counselling, pedometers or telecoaching (by computer or mobile technology)
have reported increases in physical activity in the short term (⩽4months) [6–8]. However, few studies
followed patients for ⩾1year [6, 9–11] and only one of them showed a sustained increase in physical
activity,whichwaslimitedtoasubsetofpatients[9].Thus,oneofthemaindifficultiesofinterventionsto
modifyphysicalactivityinCOPDpatientstheachievementofamoreprolongedlong-termeffect.
Giventhatcurrentlyavailableinterventionsarebasedmostlyonpatients’individualfactors(biologicaland
psychological), we argue that customising the interventions to patients’ interpersonal (social support and
cultural practices) and environmental (social, built and natural) determinants of physical activity [12]
couldhelptomaintain theincreaseinphysicalactivity inthelongterm. Indeed,areportfromtheWorld
Health Organization [13] suggests that interventions adapted to the local context and/or using existing
socialsupportandcommunitystructuresarethemostsuccessful.InCOPD,patientswholivewithothers,
walkthedog,takecareofgrandchildrenorhaveanactivepartnerhavehigherphysicalactivitylevelsthan
those who do not, regardless of COPD severity and other individual characteristics [14–16], which
suggeststhatinterpersonalandenvironmentalfactorsarekeyfactorstoincludeinfutureinterventions.
Based on these premises we designed an intervention (Urban Training) consisting of motivational
interviews, availability of outdoor walking trails specifically designed for exercise training of COPD
patients [17] and other support components. We hypothesised that Urban Training could encourage
COPDpatientstoincreaseandmaintaintheirwalkingactivityinthelongterm,becausewalkinginpublic
spacesisanextendedculturalpracticewellintegratedintothedailylifestyleofourCOPDpatients(elderly
inhabitantsofMediterraneancities)[18].
We assessed the efficacy and effectiveness of the Urban Training intervention on physical activity level
after 12months of follow-up in patients with COPD. Secondary outcomes included severe COPD
exacerbations, functional exercise capacity, body composition, health-related quality of life, anxiety and
depression.

Briefly, we selected all subjects with a diagnosis of COPD according to the American Thoracic Society/
European Respiratory Society recommendations (post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1s
(FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio <0.70) [19] who were seen in any of the participating 33
primary care and five hospital health centres from five Catalan seaside municipalities. We excluded
patientswithsevereorlife-threateningcomorbidities,orthoseclinicallyunstable.Theethicscommitteesof

all participating institutions approved the study, along with the request for complete information
exemptionfrompatients,andallparticipantsprovidedwritteninformedconsent.
Studydesignandinterventions
This is aprospective,multicentre, parallel-group, randomisedcontrolledtrial registeredat clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT01897298) and reported according to the 2010 CONSORT statement [20] and its extension for
non-pharmacological interventions [21]. Patients were allocated 1:1 to the Urban Training intervention or
usual-caregroupsusingrandomblocksizesofsix,eightand10.Thestudyconsistedoffourvisits(figure1):

Both groups received the usual standardised pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological treatment for
COPD, including pulmonary rehabilitation, at the discretion of their physician and without any
interventionbytheresearchteam.
Patients in the usual-care group were provided with general health counselling and the European Lung
Foundation (ELF) information brochure “Living an active life with COPD” [22], which recommends
⩾30minmoderatephysicalactivity⩾5daysperweek.
The Urban Training intervention consisted of the following six components (figure 2), detailed in the
online supplementary material. 1) At baseline, a respiratory physiotherapist adequately trained in
behavioural strategies used motivational interviewing techniques [23], integrated with a stage-matched
approach [24], for a maximum of 1h. The interview was centred on empathy, reflective listening and
affirmation, and addressed patients’ resistance (personal difficulties, barriers and limitations) to eliciting
behavioural change. Information on the remaining components of the intervention was provided during
thisinterview.Duringthefollow-upperiod,thephysiotherapistadministereduptofourphonecallslasting
5–10min tomaintain motivation, depending onpatients’self-efficacyand stage ofchange. 2)Participants
received a dossier containing various maps of Urban Training walking trails, previously validated [17],
accordingtotheirmobilityoptionsandpreferences.Concisely,trailsofdifferentintensities(low,moderate
or high, combining urban elements of varying intensity (stairs, ramps and types of surfacing)) were

available in several walkable public spaces (boulevards, beaches and parks) of the five municipalities. The
physiotherapist provided a complete explanation of trails characteristics and instructed patients to train
following the FITT (frequency, intensity, time and type) principle [25]. Each patient was advised to start
with a trail of intensity appropriate to his/her baseline dyspnoea and 6-min walking distance (6MWD),
andinstructedhowtoincreaseprogressivelythevolume(numberofwalksperdayonthesametrail)and/
or the intensityof the trails during the following 12months according to their symptoms and motivation
(online supplementary figure S1). In all cases, the instructions were to walk at least one trail per day
⩾5days per week, at a pace reaching a dyspnoea Borg scale score of 4–6 [26]. 3) Patients were provided
with both a pedometer and a personalised calendar to monitor their physical activity and maintain
motivation. 4) Patients received the same ELF information brochure as the usual-care group and the link
totheprojectwebsite(www.entrenament-urba.cat/).Theywere requested toprovide apersonalcellphone

and severity of COPD exacerbations in the previous 12months; 6) physical activity (Dynaport
accelerometer; McRoberts BV, The Hague, The Netherlands), previously validated for COPD [27, 28]. A
valid physical activity measurement was defined as ⩾3days with ⩾8h of wearing time within waking
hours[29];compliancewiththeaccelerometerwasexcellent (atbaselineallpatientsfulfilledthiscriterion,
median(range)wearwas7(3–7)days,andrecordingtimewas14.9(11.1–15.0)h,of15hmaximumfrom

(C-PPAC)).Additionally,at12months,patientsansweredaquestionnaireaboutsatisfactionwiththestudy

Finally, the physiotherapists administering both interventions noted down patients’ spontaneous report of
unwillingness to follow the instructions (e.g. walking ⩾5days per week ⩾30min·day−1 in the usual-care
group or walking the Urban Training trails in the Urban Training group) at the baseline visit, as well as
spontaneousreportsofnon-adherence(i.e.nothavingfollowedtheinstructions)atthe12-monthvisit.
Studyoutcomes
The primary outcome was the change in number of steps per day from baseline to 12-month follow-up.
Secondary outcomes were having any severe COPD exacerbation (leading to hospital or emergency-room
admission) during the 12-month follow-up and the 12-month changes in 6MWD, BMI, FFMI, CAT and
CCQ total scores, and HAD-anxiety and -depression scores. Exploratory outcomes were the 12-month

Prespecified efficacy and effectiveness were analysed using per-protocol and intention-to-treat (ITT)
analysis sets, respectively. Briefly, ITT was defined as all randomised patients who completed the study at
12months and provided avalid record of physical activity, while per-protocol wasthe subset of ITTwho
were classified as adherent to their corresponding intervention. Adherence was obtained from the
interviews. We classified as “non-adherent” patients who 1) spontaneously reported at baseline that they
were unwilling to follow any of the instructions; or 2) spontaneously reported at the 12-month visit that
they had not been adherent to the study protocol (see the Procedures section). Remaining patients were
labelled as “adherent”. To test effectiveness, we built linearor logistic regression models, using the change
from baseline to 12-month follow-up as the outcome, the intervention group as the main exposure
variable and baseline levels of the corresponding outcome as a covariate (to account for individual
differences in baseline levels). In efficacy analysis, we adjusted additionally for the variables related to
adherence,sincepreviousliteraturehasshownthatthisadjustmentmayreducetheselectionbiasproduced
byadifferentialdistributionofthereasonsthatmovedparticipantstobeadherent [31].
Post hoc analyses included stratification of efficacy results according to subgroups defined by baseline
patient characteristics (online supplementary material). All analyses were redone using repeated measures
ANOVA instead of linear regression. Safety analysis set included patients answering the adverse events
questions at 12months. All analyses were conducted with Stata 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX,
USA).
Results
Between30October2013and29January2016,552stableCOPDpatientswereassessedforeligibilityand
407 patients underwent randomisation and received the corresponding intervention (figure 3, online
supplementary table S2). 280 patients (69% of the initial study population) completed the final visit and
constituted the ITT analysis set (online supplementary table S3). These patients had higher physical
activity and functional exercise capacity levels at baseline than those who did not participate in the final
visit, both in the usual care and Urban Training group (online supplementary tables S3 and S4). Among
followed patients, 233 patients (83% of the ITT) did not report unwillingness or non-adherence to the

Baseline characteristics were similar in the per-protocol and ITT analysis sets and between two

After 12months, according to the per-protocol analysis set (efficacy analysis), patients in the usual-care
group had not changed their physical activity, whereasthose in the Urban Training group increased it by

(figure 4 and table 2). In the analysis adjusted by factors independently related to
adherence(FEV1/FVCratio,smoking,diabetesandHAD-depressionscore;onlinesupplementarytableS6)
and steps at baseline, the adjusted difference in steps between the Urban Training and usual-care groups
was 957 (95% CI 184–1731) steps·day−1 (figure 4 and table 2). There were no differences between
intervention groups in any of the secondary outcomes or in cognitive impairment (exploratory outcome)
(table 2). Positive changes (statistically significant better values) of physical activity experience were
observed in the intervention group for the total, amount and difficulty scores. Stratification of efficacy
results showed no significant differences between groups (figure 5). The adjusted difference at 12months
was 959 (−72–1989) steps·day−1 for patients with mild-to-moderate COPD and 383 (−860–1626)

However, the intervention was not effective according to results with the ITT analysis set, suggesting that
it improves physical activityonly in willing, adherent patients. No effect of the intervention was found on
severe COPD exacerbations, functional exercise capacity, body composition, health-related quality of life,
anxietyordepression,ineitheranalysisapproach.
The main finding of this study is that the Urban Training intervention increased physical activity in
COPD patients 1) at long-term (after 12months) and 2) in a large scale of magnitude. Most studies
testing the effects of behavioural physical activity interventions in COPD patients have successfully
resulted in positive effects only at short-term (≈3months) [6, 7], and only one reported a long-term
increase, which was restricted to a post hoc subgroup analysis [9]. Examination of the content of previous
and current successful physical activity interventions allows us to hypothesise that the combination of
motivational interviews, pedometers and diaries/calendars may be key for the long-term effect. The
≈900steps·day−1
increase observed in the Urban Training group lies within the defined limits of the
minimal important difference in COPD patients (between 600 and
1100steps·day−1)
[32] and is greater
than the
255steps·day−1
change observed in the long-term physical activity COPD trial referred to above
and the mean
808steps·day−1
change identified in a review of pedometer-based physical activity
interventions in olderadults (including follow-ups between 2weeks and 23months) [30]. Ourcontention
is that customising walking trails to patients’ individual (e.g. exercise capacity and motivation),
interpersonal (e.g. social support and cultural habit of walking) and environmental factors (e.g. lack of
steep stairs in walking trails and home proximity or bus access to them) may have contributed to the
long-term duration and large magnitude of the intervention effect. Therefore, Urban Training appears to

Potential harms of the Urban Training intervention need to be discussed. First, patients in the Urban
Training group reported lower-extremity muscle pain in a higher proportion than patients in the

usual-care group, without differences in lower-extremity joint pain or other adverse events. This could be
attributed to the fact that the Urban Training walking trails included ramps and stairs that may promote
eccentric workof thelegmuscles, whichmay result inmuscle but notjointpain [33].Second, althougha
recenttrialhasreportedanacuteincreaseinrespiratorysymptomsafterwalkinginurbanpollutedareas[34],
wedidnotcollectinformationonthesepotentialadverseeventsbecause1)mostofthetrailswerelocatedin
green or blue areas and 2) residential air pollution exposure was comparable between groups by design.
Finally, the fact that patients includedin the ITTbut not in the per-protocolanalysis set experienced greater
decline inphysicalactivitythanthosein theper-protocolanalysis setcouldsuggest thattheinterventionwas
harmful for them (which could have made them non-adherent). However, this is not supported by the fact
that they experienced the same frequency of adverse events during or after walks as the rest of the Urban
Training group and that a natural decline of physical activity levels has been observed previously in the
absenceofinterventions[35,36].
The Urban Training intervention did not improve most of the secondary and exploratory outcomes. The
lack of effect on functional exercise capacity was unexpected, since, based on the physiological response
generated when walking the trails during the validation study [17], we hypothesised that the intervention
could produce effects similar to those of typical exercise training interventions. However, the lackof daily
supervision when walking the trails may have hindered patients from regularly achieve a minimum
training intensity (e.g. walking at a pace that generates dyspnoea or fatigue scores between 4 and 6 in the
Borg scale). Indeed, a previous intervention that increased both physical activity and functional exercise
capacity after 3months had included close patient supervision via telecoaching [8]. The remaining
secondaryoutcomes(severeCOPDexacerbations,bodycomposition,qualityoflife,anxietyordepression)
were not primarily targeted by any of the Urban Training components and their improvement was
expected only as a result of the expected increase in physical activity. Based on our results, it is tempting
to speculate that the improvement in physical activity levels would need to be sustained for a period

that our patients already had a relatively good health status as per their values in COPD admissions,

The findingsof thisstudyare encouraging forCOPDresearchandits management aswell asforphysical
activity promotion in other populations. First, our findings highlight the consideration of patients’
interpersonal (social and cultural) factors and environment when designing further interventions. From
the clinical viewpoint, this approach may appear more feasible than others based strongly on technology
solutions, particularly in countries with limited healthcare budgets. Second, our study supports the
involvement of behaviour specialists in the design and administration of physical activity interventions or
an equivalent acquisition of knowledge on behavioural techniques by health professionals who generally

exhibit a lackof training in behavioural change techniques [38, 39]. Finally, at the city level, interventions
such asthe Urban Training may contribute towards amortising the investment in public space (otherwise
underused during certain times of the day) thus improving its sustainability. In fact, a close collaboration
between health professionals and local governments has been promoted for example in the World Health
OrganizationHealthyCitiesprojectandislikelytoresultinsocial,economicandhealthbenefitsforall[40].
A limitation of the current study is that we defined adherence, and consequently the per-protocol analysis
set, according to patient report. It is of note that we defined “non-adherence” from patient report and
“adherence” otherwise. Thus, the ITT analysis set included, in the first place, patients who at baseline
spontaneouslyreportedunwillingnesstoundergotheinterventiontheyhadbeenassignedto.Thesepatients
aremostoftenexcludedfromclinicaltrials,butwedecidedtokeepthem(andanalysetheirdata)inorderto
provideeffectivenessestimates.Second,theITTanalysissetincludedinadditionpatientswhoreportedatthe
12-monthvisitthattheyhadnot beenadherenttotheinterventiontowhichtheyhadbeenassigned,which
inmostcases,wasduetoafamilysituation(e.g.partnerundergoingsurgery).Again,someofthesepatients
would be excluded in traditional clinical trials. Finally, the per-protocol analysis set included patients who
did not make anyspontaneous report inrelationtotheirwillingnessoradherence,and probablycomprised
bothadherentandnon-adherentpatients,thusunderestimatingtheefficacyofUrbanTraining.
A second limitation is the apparent discrepancy between efficacy and effectiveness results. Of note, both
approaches were prespecified in our analysis plan given previous reports in the literature about poor
adherence to behavioural interventions [9, 41] and the well-known argument against ITT analysis (that it
underestimates intervention effects in situations of non-adherence) [42]. The absence of effectiveness of
Urban Training suggests the need for research to understand and eventually to identify ways to act upon
the determinants of willingness and adherence to behavioural interventions in COPD. In our study,

Othershortcomingsincludethelackofintermediateassessmentsduringthefollow-upperiod,whichcould
have given feedback to patients and would have allowed researchers to distinguish between short- and
long-termeffects.Inaddition,thefactthat≈30%ofpatientswerelosttofollow-up,acomparablefigureto
previous studies [6, 9, 10], could have biased our results. Finally, our patients exhibited higher physical
activity levels than those observed in previous studies [44–47], which could be considered a limitation of
our research. However, a comparison of the clinical characteristics and physical activity levels of the
patients included in the present and previous studies shows differences in physical activity both between
countries (for the same severity of COPD) and within countries (for different severity stages and/or
recruitment settings). We consider that, given that the Urban Training intervention was designed in a
regioncharacterised by relatively high social support, the cultural habit of walking, pedestrianaccessibility

However, other geographic areas would need to conduct a proper adaptation to their social, cultural and
environmentalcharacteristics.
Strengthsofthestudyarethenoveltyofcustomisingthebehaviouralinterventiontopatients’interpersonal
characteristics and environment, the large sample size and the measure of physical activity using an
accelerometer. In addition, patients were recruited from primary care and hospitals of several
municipalities, with barelyanyexclusion criteria, and diversity in relevant sociodemographic, lifestyle and
clinical parameters, which make our results generalisable to a wide COPD population. The lack of
differencesinefficacywhenpatientswerestratifiedaccordingtotheirbaselinefeaturesfurthersupportsthe

In conclusion, the Urban Training intervention, combining behavioural strategies with unsupervised
outdoor walking, was efficacious in increasing physical activity after 12months in COPD patients.
However, it was ineffective in the full population including unwilling and self-reported non-adherent
patients. The Urban Training intervention had no effect on severe COPD exacerbations, functional
exercisecapacity,bodycomposition,health-relatedqualityoflife,anxietyordepression.
