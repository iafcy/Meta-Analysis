BACKGROUND: Pulmonary rehabilitation is an effective treatment for patients with COPD, but
patient uptake and adherence to the current offering of center-based pulmonary rehabilitation is
modest due to transportation, access, poverty, and frailty, and even more so in the context of the
COVID pandemic. Home-based options have been proposed and were found noninferior to center-
based rehabilitation; however, there is a lack of home-based programs, and more understanding is
needed. We aimed to test the feasibility, uptake, and adherence to a home-based program for
COPD rehabilitation with health coaching. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial with a
wait-list controlled design to evaluate the effects of a home-based program with health coaching on
breathlessness in subjects with moderate to severe COPD unable to attend the regular pulmonary
rehabilitation program. The 8-week intervention consisted of video-guided exercises to be done 6
times a week and captured with a computer tablet. Health coaching was done weekly over the tele-
phone to review subject activity and symptoms and to provide an opportunity for the subject to
define their weekly goals. The primary outcomes were uptake, adherence, and Chronic Respiratory
Questionnaire (CRQ) Dyspnea Domain. Secondary outcomes were self-management abilities and
CRQ Emotions-Mastery-Fatigue. RESULTS: 154 subjects with moderate to severe COPD were
randomized. Subject adherence was 86% to the proposed 6-times a week exercise routine. There
(P 5 .062) was no significant difference in breathlessness (CRQ dyspnea). There was a significant
improvement in self-management abilities (P < .001). The results of the qualitative interviews
showed high levels of acceptability of the program. CONCLUSIONS: The tested home-based reha-
bilitation program with health coaching was feasible, highly acceptable, showed a high degree of ad-
herence, and improved self-management abilities. This study offers seminal information for home-
based rehabilitation programs to design alternative options of rehabilitation to individuals with COPD
that cannot attend to the well-established center-based pulmonary rehabilitation. (ClinicalTrials.gov
