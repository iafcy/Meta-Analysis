improved physical activity at 6months. Additional intervention modifications are needed to optimise its

Introduction
COPD is a leading cause of death in the US [1] and a major contributor to morbidity, mortality and
resource utilisation worldwide [2, 3].Patients with COPD are limited in theirexercise capacity, which can
result in deleterious downstream effects including reduced physical activity and health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) [4]. With no cure, proactive self-management of COPD is critical to maintaining or
improving health outcomes [5]. Ultimate goals of COPD self-management include optimising and

preserving exercise capacity, reducing symptoms and functional impairments in daily life, and increasing
emotional and social well-being, and HRQoL. Self-management interventions for COPD are often
multicomponent, structured and personalised programmes with goals of motivating, engaging and
supporting patients to adopt positive health behaviours (e.g. physical activity) and develop skills to better
manage their disease [6, 7]. Technology-based platforms may offer a promising approach to promote
disease self-management and bring interventions directly to patients [8, 9]. Such solutions are particularly
relevant during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic when many in-person programmes are closed.
Rigorous examination of how effective technology-based self-management interventions are in promoting
keyCOPDoutcomes,suchasexercisecapacity,isneeded[10].
We designed a web-based self-management intervention focused on physical activity promotion for
personswithCOPD[11–13].Thismulticomponentintervention,basedontheTheoryofSelf-Regulation[14],
promotes physical activity through individualised, progressive goal setting and iterative step-count
feedback, delivers online COPD-related education and motivational messages, and provides social support
viaanonlinecommunityforum.OurinterventionfocusesonpromotingwalkingsincepersonswithCOPD
who walk more have better HRQoL [11], and decreased risks of acute exacerbations [15] and mortality
[16,17].
We have previously demonstrated at a single site that use of our web-based physical activity
self-management intervention for 3 [13] and 4months [11] resulted in significant, clinically meaningful
improvements in daily step counts [11, 13] and HRQoL [11]. In the current randomised controlled trial
(RCT), we extend our previous work in two ways: 1) the duration of the intervention was increased to
6monthstoassessifitcouldimproveexercisecapacityinadditiontophysicalactivity;and2)weenrolled
COPD participants at two geographically distinct study sites to assess response to the intervention in a
heterogeneous cohort. Our primary hypothesis was that participants assigned to the intervention would
demonstrate significant improvements in exercise capacity compared to controls at 6months. Our
secondary hypothesis was that participants in the intervention group would demonstrate significant
improvements in other COPD self-management outcomes (HRQoL, dyspnoea, physical activity, disease
education,socialsupportandoccurrenceofacuteexacerbations)comparedtocontrols.Someoftheresults
ofthisstudyhavebeenpreviouslyreportedintheformofanabstract [18].

Studyparticipants
Participants were recruited from May 2015-February 2019 at two US sites. At VABoston (BOS), mailings
were sent to COPD patients in outpatient pulmonary clinics. VABirmingham (BIR) patients were
approached by their provider (J.A.C.) who referred interested participantsto the research coordinator. The
study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (BOS #2791 and BIR #01534) and registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov(NCT02099799).Participantsprovidedwritteninformedconsent.
Baselineassessmentandrandomisation
At baseline, demographics, medical history, postbronchodilator mean forced expiratory volume in 1s
(FEV ) % predicted and outcomes were assessed [19]. Rural–urban commuting area codes (RUCA)
1
classified participants’ rurality [20]. Participants wore a Fitbit Zip pedometer (fitbit, San Francisco, CA,
USA) for 10days with a sticker covering the display to prevent feedback. Participants who met inclusion
criteria (table 1) and had ⩾7 valid wear-days at baseline (>200 steps/day) [21] were randomised 1:1 to
either the internet-mediated, pedometer-based physical activity intervention or usual care (control) for
6months(figure1).Thestudystatistician(D.G.)generatedtherandomallocationsequence.
Randomisationgroups
Participants in both the intervention and control groups received verbal encouragement to increase daily
physical activity and an education booklet that contained COPD self-management information about
aerobic endurance and strengthening exercises, an action plan for COPD acute exacerbations, how to
resume exercise after an acute exacerbation, oxygen use during exercise, and smoking cessation [6]. The
usual care control group did not have contact with the blinded study staff until the in-person outcome
assessments 3 and 6months following the baseline visit. Participants randomised to the intervention were
mailed detailed instructions about the study website. The intervention group was instructed to wear the
pedometer daily and received access to the content on the website. The intervention supports the cycle of
self-regulation with four unique components to promote physical activity and COPD self-management:
1) objective walking assessment and feedback; 2) individualised step-count goals; 3) educational tips and

occurred at 3 and 6months for both groups. At each follow-up visit, studystaff reminded participants not
to disclose randomisation assignment and that they should be working to increase their walking and
exercise.Theoutcomeassessorandstatisticianwereblindedtorandomisationassignment.
Outcomemeasures
All outcomes were assessed during in-person visits at baseline, 3 and 6months; daily step counts were
assessed over a 14-day period after 3- and 6-month visits. The primary outcome was change in exercise
capacity from baseline to 6months. This was assessed with participants’ 6-min walk distance (6MWD),
performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines (except no practice walk was
performed in either randomisation group) [22]. Secondary outcomes included physical activity, HRQoL,
dyspnoea, COPD knowledge, social support and acute exacerbations. At 3 and 6months, physical activity
(steps/day) was averaged over ⩾4 valid pedometer wear-days within a 14-day period. The St. George’s
Respiratory Questionnaire Total Score (SGRQ-TS) [23] measured HRQoL, and the modified Medical
Research Council (mMRC) assessed dyspnoea [24]. We evaluated COPD knowledge and social support
with the Bristol COPD Knowledge Questionnaire (BCKQ) [25] and Medical Outcomes Study Social
Support (MOS-SS) scale [26]. Self-reported acute exacerbations of COPD, with or without hospitalisation
were assessed at the 3- and 6-month study visits. Participants were coded as either having experienced at
least one exacerbation in the last 6months or none. Other serious (defined as non-COPD acute
exacerbation-related hospitalisations and/or deaths) or musculoskeletal (new or worsening leg, foot and/or
back pain or discomfort) adverse events were also self-reported and tracked at 3 and 6months to assess
safety. Participants were coded as having experienced a serious adverse event or not, and as having
experiencedamusculoskeletaleventornot.
Within the intervention group, engagement was assessed with change in weekly step-count goals at
6monthsfrombaseline.Participantswhomettheirgoalsreceivedahighergoalthefollowingweek.Thus,
a positive change in step-count goals indicated engagement. An intervention feedback questionnaire
administered at 6months also assessed engagement. Participants were asked if: 1) they would recommend

counts; 5) the motivational messages and educational tips were easy to understand; and 6) they learned
helpful information using the online community forum. Participants could respond true, false or indicate
thattheydidnotusethecomponent.
Samplesize
Using the minimum clinically important difference in 6MWD of 54m [27] and a SD of 100m [27], we
estimated that 110 participants (55/group) at 6months would provide adequate power (β=80%) at an
α=0.05.
Statisticalanalysis
Independent sample t-tests and Chi-square tests assessed between-group and between-site differences in
baseline characteristics and adverse events. Chi-square tests assessed between-site differences in
intervention feedback responses. In intention-to-treat analyses, generalised linear mixed-effects models
(PROCMIXED,SASv9.4,Cary,NC,USA)forrepeatedmeasuresemployingafirst-orderauto-regressive
covariance matrix were constructed. Change in outcomes was predicted by randomisation group
(intervention versus usual care), study visit (3 and 6months), and the interaction between randomisation
group and study visit. Models were adjusted for FEV % predicted, age, site and rurality. p-value <0.05

was considered statistically significant. Season of enrolment was initially included as a covariate but had
nosignificantimpactontheresultsandwasthereforeremovedforamoreparsimoniousmodel.
Results
Of the 204 eligible participants, 153 participants were randomised to either the intervention (n=75) or
control (n=78) group (figure 1). Those who were randomised (n=153) reported significantly higher
SGRQ-TS (worse HRQoL) compared to those who were not randomised (n=51) (mean±SD SGRQ-TS =
38±18 versus 27±23, respectively, p=0.005). There were no other significant differences between those
who were and were not randomised. A significantly larger proportion of participants who were lost to
follow-up were rural (p=0.048), less educated (p=0.016) and enrolled at BIR (p=0.008) compared to
thosewhocompletedthe6-monthstudy.
There were no significant between-randomisation group differences in baseline characteristics or
occurrenceofsevereormusculoskeletaladverseeventsduringthestudy(p-values>0.05;table2).
Primaryoutcome
There was no significant difference between randomisation groups in 6-month change in 6MWD (mean
difference of −12m; p=0.189). Both groups demonstrated statistically and clinically significant
within-group changes in 6MWD at 6months compared to baseline (table 3). The intervention group
increasedby25m(p=0.010)andthecontrolgroupincreasedby37m(p<0.001).
Secondaryoutcomes
The intervention group significantly increased physical activity by a mean daily step-count of 1312 steps/
day (95% CI 600–2024, p<0.001) more than the control group at 6months (table 3). The intervention
group increased by 673 steps/day, compared to the control group who decreased by 639 steps/day from
baseline to 6months. Change in SGRQ-TS, mMRC dyspnoea score, BCKQ score, MOS-SS score or
number of acute exacerbations (total and COPD-related hospitalisations) at 6months did not significantly
differbetweenrandomisationgroupsat6months(table3).
Site
Participants at the two study sites differed on several baseline measurements. Compared to BOS, BIR
participants were significantly younger, had a higher proportion of non-white participants and those who
currently used oxygen, made <USD 30000 annually and were rural (p’s<0.05; table 2). BIR participants
also had lower FEV % predicted, lower 6MWD, lower daily step counts and higher SGRQ-TS (worse

HRQoL)(p-values<0.05;table2).Ofthe114(outof153)participantswhocompletedthe6-monthvisit,
more BOS participants reported experiencing a musculoskeletal adverse event compared to BIR (59%
versus22%;p=0.001).
Because sitewas a significant predictorof 6-month change in 6MWD (p=0.006) and HRQoL (p= 0.005)
in our a priori models, we conducted exploratory analyses to examine if site modified the effect of
interventiononoutcomes.Twoexploratorymodelspredictingoutcomesat6monthswereexamined,which

Inthoseassignedtotheintervention,BIRparticipants’meandailystep-countgoalsincreasedby437more
steps/dayacrossthe 6-month (24-week) study period compared to BOS (figure 3), although the difference
between groups was not significant (p=0.239). Both sites showed significant increases in step-count goals
across the 6-month study period, compared to baseline. For example, BOS participants increased their
mean daily step-count goal by 505 steps/day (p=0.014), while BIR participants had an increase of 807
steps/day(p=0.021).
Of the 60 intervention participants (out of 75) who completed the 6-month visit, 44 (73%) responded to
the intervention feedback questionnaire. The majority (n=42, 95%) indicated they would recommend the
intervention to others with COPD, 33 (75%) thought the intervention helped them stick to their walking
and 42 (95%) reported they would continue to exercise after the research study ended. Regarding
engagement with intervention components, 38 (86%) looked at the step-count graphs. Twenty-four (55%)
found the motivational and educational tips easy to understand, while 20 (45%) reported that they did not
use this component. Eleven (25%) participants indicated they learned helpful information from the online

6MWD. While we found strong evidence that our intervention improved physical activity, this
improvement did not translate to improved exercise capacity. Previous research has shown weak
correlations between exercise capacity and physical activity [30]. Exercise capacity, as measured by the
episodic 6MWD, represents what the patient can do. Physical activity, integrated over time and in the
home environment, represents what the patient does do, accounting for many factors (e.g. psychosocial,
environmental)otherthantheunderlyingCOPDthatmayimpactphysicalactivity[31].
Our results suggest that if technology-based self-management interventions are to improve exercise
capacity, they will need to focus on both physical activity duration and intensity [32]. Our
self-management intervention did not include an aerobic exercise training component as the goal was to
promotewalking,whichmostpatientswithCOPDcando.Theimportanceofexercisetrainingcanbeseen

combination of a self-management intervention with pharmacological treatment and exercise training
resulted in the greatest improvements in exercise capacity compared to self-management with placebo, or

self-management with pharmacological treatment (and no exercise training) [33]. Similarly, a
community-based exercise programme (including walking, cycling and strength exercises) coupled with a
self-management programme (COPE-active) resulted in significant between-group differences in both
exercise capacity and physical activity after 12months [34]. An important difference between the current
study and the PHYSACTO and COPE-active trials is that our self-management intervention, fully
automatedandremotelydelivered,couldbeaccessedbythosewhocannotattendin-personprogrammes.
Technology-mediated interventions vary in the level of automation and how self-guided they are (i.e.
some may include more contact or guidance from research or clinical staff). Our technology-
mediated intervention increased physical activity but not exercise capacity; this is in line with other
technology-mediated trials which also used a more self-guided internet-mediated physical activity
intervention [35]. In a contrasting example, VORRINK et al. [36] had participants who recently completed

decreased physical activity but were able to maintain their post-rehabilitation exercise capacity levels [36].
DEMEYER et al. [37] found increases in both physical activity and 6MWD in an intervention that included
interviewswiththeinvestigatortodiscussmotivation,barriers,favouriteactivitiesandstrategiestobecome
more active. In addition, automatically updated goals could be changed by the research staff, and
participants received text messages with activity proposals from the investigator, taking local weather into
account. In our study, we had contact with the participant only when we called them weekly to give them
their step-count goals and during the 3- and 6-month study visits. Taken together, it appears that
technology-mediatedinterventionscanbemorewidelyaccessible,butconventionalin-personprogrammes,

the study. Variable levels of engagement with the website as reported in the feedback questionnaire
provide context for why we did not see significant changes in other secondaryoutcomes besides physical
activity. Educational tips on COPD medications, symptom management, oxygen use, smoking cessation
and acute exacerbations, as well as motivational messages, were provided on thewebsite. The majority of
participants looked at their step-count graphs, though almost half of participants indicated they did not
lookatthemotivationalandeducationaltips,andmostparticipantsdidnotlookattheonlineforum.While
technology-mediated interventions coupled with guidance from healthcare professionals may yield
significant improvements, they likely require more staff labour, training and higher costs. Modification of
our intervention with additional guidance or encouragement by research staff or clinical team members to
increaseuseofitscomponentsmayimproveCOPDself-managementandassociatedoutcomes.
While BIR participants (intervention andcontrol groups) improved morethan BOSparticipants in 6MWD
and HRQoL, there was no statistical evidence that site modified the effect of the intervention on the
specified outcomes. However, there was some evidence to suggest that for those assigned to the
intervention, sites differed in their level of engagement with the physical activity promotion component.
The differences observed in engagement by site may be explained by the notable differences in their
sample characteristics and recruitment strategies. BIR participants appeared more limited by their disease
(i.e. lower average 6MWD, FEV % predicted and daily step counts at baseline) compared to BOS and

thusmayhavemorepotentialforimprovement.Additionally,BIRparticipantswererecruitedpragmatically
by their usual provider, whereas BOS participants were recruited with a less personal approach through
mailings by research staff. Thus, BIR patients may have been more motivated to increase their walking
because of their personal connection with the provider recruiting for the research study. Recruitment at
BIR may have been influenced byselection bias since participants whowere more likely to be successful
orengagedintheinterventionmayhavebeenenrolled.
Using two sites, we demonstrate that our web-based self-management intervention can significantly
improve physical activity at an urban site like BOS as well as a more rural site like BIR that enrolled
participants with lower annual income and were more likely from rural areas. Along with greater risk for
poor health status, acute exacerbations, hospitalisations and mortality, rural patients with COPD have
limited access to in-person care and centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation programmes [38]. Thus, our
intervention may be a “better than nothing” alternative to promote physical activity in a diverse group of
patientswithCOPD.Thistrialcomparedourinterventiontousualcare.Futureresearchwouldbenefitfrom

Limitationsandfuturedirections
Strengths include the randomised and blinded study design, dual-site approach, 6-month time frame, and
examination of HRQoL, COPD knowledge, social support and acute exacerbations using validated
questionnaires [39, 40]. Current guidelines for the 6MWT, published in 2014, recommend a practicewalk
24h before the actual test [41]. When we started this study in 2015, we chose not to include a practice
walk to reduce participant burden and not require travel to the medical centre on six separate occasions
(twice at baseline, 3months and 6months). Because we did not ask participants to perform a practice
walk, there was a possibility that the within-group increase in 6MWD from baseline to 6months in both
groups could be attributable to a learning effect. However, it is known that this learning effect dissipates
after3months[41].Weevaluatedchangein6MWDafter6months;therefore,anylearningeffectislikely
to be even less. Additionally, although 6MWD consistently increased at the second walk test performed
2–5daysapart,SPENCERetal.[42]demonstratedthatchangesin6MWDat3monthscomparedtobaseline
after pulmonary rehabilitation did not differ significantly from each other regardless of whetherone chose
the first, second or better 6MWD at each time point. Thus, our results examining change scores at
6months are unlikely to be different had practice walks been performed. While the study expanded our
past work with a more socioeconomically diverse sample, ourcohort was self-selected and majority white
male, limiting generalisability in some respects. The 6-month study period extends our prior work, and it
is promising that significant improvements in daily step counts were maintained. Future work should
extend the follow-up period beyond 6months, focus on exercise intensity to optimise effects on exercise
capacityandmaximiseengagementwithothercomponentsoftheintervention.
