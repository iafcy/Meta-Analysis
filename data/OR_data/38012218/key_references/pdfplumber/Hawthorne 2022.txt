Abstract
Background: The use of vital signs monitoring in the early recognition of an acute exacerbation of chronic obstruc‑
tive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) post‑hospital discharge is limited. This study investigated whether continuous vital
signs monitoring could predict an AECOPD and readmission.
Methods: 35 people were recruited at discharge following hospitalisation for an AECOPD. Participants were asked
to wear an Equivital LifeMonitor during waking hours for 6 weeks and to complete the Exacerbations of Chronic
Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT), a 14‑item symptom diary, daily. The Equivital LifeMonitor recorded respiratory rate
(RR), heart rate (HR), skin temperature (ST) and physical activity (PA) every 15‑s. An AECOPD was classified as mild (by
EXACT score), moderate (prescribed oral steroids/antibiotics) or severe (hospitalisation).
Results: Over the 6‑week period, 31 participants provided vital signs and symptom data and 14 participants experi‑
enced an exacerbation, of which, 11 had sufficient data to predict an AECOPD. HR and PA were associated with EXACT
score (p < 0.001). Three days prior to an exacerbation, RR increased by mean SD 2.0 0.2 breaths/min for seven out
± ±
of 11 exacerbations and HR increased by 8.1 0.7 bpm for nine of these 11 exacerbations.
±
Conclusions: Increased heart rate and reduced physical activity were associated with worsening symptoms. Even
with high‑resolution data, the variation in vital signs data remains a challenge for predicting AECOPDs. Respiratory
rate and heart rate should be further explored as potential predictors of an impending AECOPD.
