Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland The intervention ended after three months and an unsupervised observational period fol-
lowed until twelve months. Primary outcome was daily step count after one year.
Results: Seventy-four participants were included, 61 (82%) completed the study. Linear regres-
sion modelling, adjusted for baseline step count, showed no significant difference in change in step
count after 12 months between the groups (Β = 547.33, 95% CI = −243.55/1338.20).
Conclusion: A three-month program combining physical activity counselling and ped-
ometer-based feedback in addition to usual care does not attenuate the declining course of
physical activity in participants with severe and very severe COPD during a long term
follow-up of one year as compared to usual care. This result was primarily determined by the
low intervention response rates to the combined program.

Plain Language Summary
Combined physical activity counselling and pedometer-based feedback is a promising inter-
vention towards physical activity enhancement in participants with COPD. However, scarce
long-term data on its effects are available. In this study, we investigated the effects of three
months combined physical activity counselling and pedometer-based feedback, followed by
a nine-month unsupervised observation period as compared to usual care in participants with
severe to very severe COPD. We found that the three-month combined program was not
superior to usual care in preserving physical activity after one year. Interestingly, a similar
number of participants in both groups managed to improve their physical activity.
