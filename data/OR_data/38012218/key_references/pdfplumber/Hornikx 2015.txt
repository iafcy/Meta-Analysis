counseling program after an exacerbation
in patients with Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease: a randomized
controlled pilot study

Abstract
Background: Insome patients with COPD, thedisease is characterized byexacerbations. Severe exacerbations
warrant a hospitalization, with prolonged detrimental effects onphysical activity. Interventions after an exacerbation
mayimprovephysical activity, with longstanding health benefits. Physical activitycounseling and real-time feedback
were effective in stable COPD.No evidence is availableon theuse of this therapeutic modality inpatientsafter a
COPD exacerbation.
Methods: Thirty patients were randomlyassigned to usual care or physical activity counseling, by telephone
contacts ata frequency of3 times a week and real-time feedback. Lung function, peripheral muscle strength,
functional exercise capacity,symptom experience and COPD-related health status were assessed during hospital
stay and 1 month later.
Results: Bothgroupssignificantlyrecoveredinphysicalactivity(PAsteps:controlgroup:1013±1275stepsvsintervention

The last limitation of our study was that we did not
spread the intervention over a longer time window to
allow a slower continued recovery. The fact that patients
seemed to stagnate in their PA levels, however, suggests
that not much further improvements should be expected
by simply prolonging the present intervention. In order to
improve the effectiveness of future studies, a rewarding
system, home visits and the investigation of motivational
aspects should be implemented.
Although the low sample size of the present study

PA counseling immediately after an exacerbation is time
consuming and not effective to enhance PA or clinical
