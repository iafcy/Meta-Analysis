Effects of individualized target setting on step count in Japanese 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a pilot study
Abstract
Introduction: Improving physical activity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a very important issue; 
however, effective recommended targets for individual patients remain to be determined. 
Material and methods: We developed a method for setting a target value for the step count for each patient using a measured 
value and the predicted step count. We then evaluated the effect of providing a pedometer or a pedometer with this target value 
for eight weeks on the step count in patients with COPD. 
Results: Sixteen stable COPD patients were included in the analysis. Overall, no significant increase in the step count was ob­
tained by providing the target value; however, when the patients were divided into two groups based on the median step count 
at baseline, a significant increase in the step count was observed in the low step-count group. In both the overall population and 
the low step-count group, there was a significant increase in the target achievement rate in patients who received a pedometer 
with a target value in comparison to patients who were given a pedometer without a target value. 
Conclusions: Physical activity may be improved by providing a newly developed individual target step count to COPD patients 
with a low step count at baseline.
Key words: physical activity, step count, target value

Introduction
In patients with chronic obstructive pulmo­
nary disease (COPD), airflow limitation results 
in decreased physical activity (PA). Patients with 
reduced PA have a significantly poorer prognosis 
than those with adequate PA [1], and PA is the 
strongest predictor of all-cause mortality [2].
The importance of improving and maintaining 
PA has therefore been emphasized. The effect of 
medical intervention on improving PA remains 
controversial [3–5]; however, some reports have 
described the beneficial consequences of broncho­
dilators [6–10], pulmonary rehabilitation [11–13], 
rehabilitation with counseling [14–16], and in­
creased motivation [17, 18] on PA. Among several 
interventions for improving PA, counseling has 
tended to result in better outcomes in comparison 
to other approaches [19]. Counseling requires sev­
eral important elements, including target setting, 
feedback, target achievement, and increased mo­
tivation [5]. Moy et al. reported a series of studies 
to evaluate the effects of providing target step 
count values using an internet-mediated program
[14, 20, 21]. The effectiveness of providing the 
target value was achieved after 3 or 4 months [14, 
20], but was not observed after 12 months [21].
The possible reason why the number of steps 
did not increase at 12 months is that even if the 
patients worked hard to increase the number of 
steps, the target value was reviewed and increased 
weekly, and/or the target value was set according 
to the present step count but not to the disease 
condition of the patient, which could make it 
difficult for patients to maintain their motivation. 
Actually, half of the participants believed the au­
tomatically-determined step count target was too 
high and many did not feel comfortable reaching 
their objective [22]. For the step count to be in­

creased and maintained, the target value should 
reflect the disease condition of each patient and 
should be one that allows patients to experience 
a feeling of achievement at reaching the goal. We 
recently created a formula to determine the pre­
dicted step count (Pred) using parameters associ­
ated with the step count in COPD patients. This 
formula consists of age, mMRC, and inspiratory 
capacity (IC) [23], and reflects the disease condi­
tion of each patient.
In the present study, we developed a method 
for setting the target step count (Targ) based on 
the measured step count (Meas) and Pred, and 
preliminarily evaluated the effect of providing this 
target value on the increase in the total step count.
Materials and methods
Patients
Stable COPD patients of ≥ 40 years of age 
were recruited from the outpatient clinic of Na­
tional Hospital Organization Wakayama Hospital 
from August 2019 to April 2020. COPD was de­
fined as a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory 
volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity 
(FVC) value of < 0.7. The patients were excluded 
if they were being treated with oxygen therapy, 
had clinically evident bronchial asthma, had 
experienced an exacerbation in the past three 
months, or had factors that obviously influenced 
their PA, such as neuromuscular disease, severe 
osteoarthritis, an active malignant tumor, or acute 
myocardial infarction.
Study design
This was a pilot, prospective, open-label, be­
fore-after study. The patients were obliged to visit 
our hospital three times: week –2 (visit 1), week 
8 (visit 2), and week 16 (visit 3). A pedometer was 
provided at visit 1, and the subjects recorded their 
daily step count by themselves until week 16. The 
step count in the first 2 weeks was defined as the 
Meas at baseline, and the record of this step count 
was mailed back to our hospital. The Targ was 
calculated based on the Meas at baseline and the 
Pred calculated by Nakanishi’s formula [23] and 
was provided to the patient at visit 2 (week 8). 
At visit 1, the patients were instructed to spend 
their time as usual from week –2 to week 0, but to 
increase the number of steps as much as possible 
from week 0 to week 8. In other words, at week 
8, we evaluated the increase in the step count 
that was achieved by providing a pedometer. At 
visit 2, the patients were informed about the Targ 
and encouraged to increase their step count to 
exceed the Targ from week 8 to week 16. In other 
words, at week 16, we evaluated the increase in 
the step count achieved by providing the Targ.
The patients were instructed to record the step 
count, weather and special activities in a diary 
every day, and to bring the diary on every visit.
The primary endpoint was the change over time 
in the ratio of Meas/Targ. The secondary end­
points were the changes over time in the ratio 
of Meas/Targ in patients with the low and high 
step-count groups, the target achievement rate 
at week 16 among all patients, including those 
in the low and high step-count groups, and the 
correlation between the Meas/Targ at week 16 and 
the demographic factors of the patients.
This study was conducted in accordance with 
the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by 
the local ethics committee (committee: IRB com­
mittee of National Hospital Organization Wakaya­
ma Hospital; Approval number: 26–1; approval 
date: October 31, 2014; Clinical Trial Registration: 
UMIN; registration number: UMIN000016363; 
registration date: January 28, 2015 [http://www.
umin.ac.jp]). Written informed consent was ob­
tained from all participants.
Data processing
The step count was measured using a pre­
viously validated pedometer, which detected 
steps with a triaxial-typed accelerometer, HJ-
325 (OMRON Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan) [24]. The 
subjects were instructed to wear the pedometer 
on their waist. Rainy days and days when spe­
cial activities were performed, were defined as 
invalid days. The average step count for two 
weeks, with the exclusion of invalid days, was 
used. If the number of valid days was fewer than 
three, the patient’s data were excluded from the 
analysis. The average step count from week 6 to 
8 was defined as the step count of week 8, and 
the average value from week 14 to week 16 was 
defined as the step count of week 16.
Setting the Targ
To reflect the disease condition of each pa­
tient, we used Nakanishi’s formula to determine 
the predicted step count, which was determined 
using factors associated with the step count in 
Japanese COPD patients [23]. The formula was as 
follows: Step count = (–0.079 × [age] –1.595 × 
[mMRC] + 2.078 × [IC] + 18.149)³. First, we 
selected the patients who should be recom­
mended to increase their step counts. In the Na­
kanishi’s study population, 50% of patients had 
a Meas value that was less than the Pred value,

www.journals.viamedica.pl
while 75% had a Meas value that was less than
Pred × 2.0. Furthermore, the Ministry of Health, 
Labor and Welfare of Japan recommends that 
individuals ≥ 65 years of age in the male general 
population maintain a step count of more than 
7,000 [25]. Therefore, we selected patients whose 
Meas value was less than Pred × 2.0 and less 
than 7,000 as patients whose Targ value should 
be higher than the Meas value.
To make it easier for patients to achieve their 
targets, we divided the number of steps from 0 to 
the Pred × 2.0 into 10 ranges and set the Targ as 
the lowest value in the area above (Figure 1). For 
example, when the Meas at baseline was ≥ 0.6
but < 0.8 of the Pred, the Targ was set at 0.8
of the Pred. When the Meas at baseline was
≥ 2.0 of the Pred, the Targ was set to the same 
value as the Meas. When the Meas at baseline was 
< 7,000 and the calculated target value exceeded 
7,000, the Targ was set at 7,000. When the Meas 
at baseline was ≥ 7,000, the Targ was set to the 
same value as the Meas.
Statistical analyses
The D’Agostino and Pears test was used for 
evaluation of normality of distribution. The Fried­
man test was applied to compare the Meas/Targ 
between each time point. A Spearman’s correla­
tion coefficient was used to assess the correlation 
between the Meas/Targ at week 16 and the de­
mographic factors of the patients. A chi-squared 
test was used to compare the number of patients 
who achieved the target between weeks 8 and 16.
The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the 
patient demographic factors between the high and 
low step-count groups.
Results
Nineteen patients were registered. Three 
individuals were excluded due to hospitalization 
(n = 1), pneumonia (n = 1), or withdrawal of con­
sent (n = 1). Ultimately, 16 cases (male, n = 13;
female, n = 3; mean age, 72.6 ± 7.2 years; FEV1% 
of predicted value, 56.3 ± 17.0) were included in 
the analysis (Figure 2). All patients had data for 
≥ 3 valid days. The GOLD stages of the subjects 
were as follows: I, n = 2; II, n = 8; III, n = 5; IV,
n = 1 (Table 1). No increase in the step count 
over time was observed in the overall population
(p = 0.06) (Figure 3). However, when the patients 
whose Meas at baseline was lower than the me­
dian value (low step-count group) were compared 
with the patients whose Meas at baseline was 
higher than the median value (high step-count 
group), the provision of the Targ was associated 
with a significant increase in step count in the 
low step-count group (p = 0.008). In contrast, in 
the high step-count group, the step count was not 
significantly increased (Figure 4). In the low step-
count group, it was confirmed that the number 
of steps increased by 630 steps on average after 
the target value was provided compared to the 
number observed before the target value was set. 
There was not significant correlation between the 
Meas/Targ at week 16 and any demographic factor;

Discussion
Providing the Targ did not increase the step 
count in the overall population but did signifi­
cantly elevate the target achievement rate. Fur­
thermore, it significantly increased the step count 
and the target achievement rate in the low step-
count group but not in the high step-count group.
When the patients were classified into two 
groups based on the median Meas at baseline, the 
step count was significantly raised by providing 
the Targ in the low step-count group. In this study, 
the effect of supplying a pedometer was evaluated 
at week 8, and the consequence of providing the

however, the correlation coefficient between the 
Meas/Targ and the Meas at baseline was relatively 
higher in comparison to other factors (r = –0.375) 
(Table 2). In the overall population and in the 
low step-count group, the target achievement rate 
at week 16 was significantly higher than that at 
week 8 (p = 0.034 and p = 0.039, respectively), 
however, this association was not observed in the 
high step-count group (Table 3). In addition, the 
Meas/Pred ratio at baseline in the high step-count 
group was significantly larger than that in the low 
step-count group (Table 4).

Targ was assessed at week 16. The increase in the 
step count at week 16 in comparison to that at 
week 8 therefore represented the effect of provid­
ing the Targ. By supplying the Targ, in low step-
count group, the step count increased by 630 on 
average, which exceeded the minimal important 
difference of the amount of improvement in the 
step count by rehabilitation (600 steps) [26], and 
was considered a clinically significant increase.
Regarding the method of setting the target, 
Moy et al. set the target step count as the low­
est of the following: 1) previous goal + 400 or 
600 steps, 2) average of the most recent 7 days + 
400 or 600 steps, or 3) 10,000 steps. The step count 
after 3 or 4 months was significantly increased 
in comparison to that in the control group [14, 
20] but that after 12 months was not [21]. This 
might be why these target values did not reflect 
the disease condition of each patient, increased 
weekly, and did little to provide the patient with 
a feeling of achievement in reaching their goal or 
to prolong their motivation. In this study we newly 
developed a target setting method that reflected 
the disease condition of each patient, which could 
easily provide the patient with a sense of achieve­
ment in reaching their target, and which was fixed 
for a certain period. Furthermore, the patients who 
should increase their step count were extracted.
The Meas/Targ at week 16 was not correlated 
with any patient demographic factors, but the cor­
relation coefficient between the Meas/Targ at week 
16 and the Meas at baseline was higher than other 
factors. Based on this result, we divided the pa­
tients into the high step-count and low step-count 
groups. When we evaluated the effect of providing 
the Targ to each group, the provision of the Targ 
significantly increased the step count in the low 
step-count group but not in the high step-count 
group. One possible reason for this difference 
might be that the patients in the high step-count

group had already walked quite a lot at baseline, 
which made it difficult to further increase the step 
count. Indeed, in the high step-count group, the 
Meas/Pred at baseline was significantly higher 
than that in the low step-count group (Table 4). 
Another possibility is that the step count of the 
patients in the high step-count group was strongly 
influenced by several other factors, resulting in 
a greater variation in step count in comparison to 
the low step-count group. This might have made 
any further increase in the step count difficult, due 
to the already marked variation in the step count. 
Travis et al. compared the step count in COPD pa­
tients according to the stage of COPD and showed 
that the standard deviation of the step count was 
large and widely varied in patients with a high 
step count [27], which supports our hypothesis.
In the overall population, the target achieve­
ment rate increased significantly after the Targ 
was provided. This suggests that — to some ex­
tent — our method of setting a target was feasible 
and appropriate. However, as the target achieve­
ment rate was not significantly increased in the 
high step-count group, it might be necessary to 
improve the method for setting targets for these 
patients. As the number of steps walked by the 
patients in the high step-count group was already 
close to the Pred value, adjustment of the range 
of the Meas/Pred at baseline or the inclusion of 
the Meas/Pred value at baseline may be required 
to determine the target for these patients. 
No significant increase in the step count was 
observed by providing a pedometer alone at week 
8 in either group. Previous studies showed that 
the step count increased after three months with 
a pedometer alone [17] and with three-month 
intervention using a pedometer along with web-
based intervention [20], which was inconsistent 
with the current results. In comparison to these 
reports in which the patients received counseling, 
in our study, we only verbally recommended that 
the patients increase their step count at each visit. 
This difference in approach might have caused 
differences in the effect of the provision of a pe­
dometer on the step count. 
Of note, the step count does not account 
for intensity, which may be important for the 
evaluation of PA. However, when the step count 
was employed in type 2 diabetic patients, the 
subjects showed increased satisfaction, and their 
PA become similar to that when a certain degree 
of intensity (continuously walking at a speed 
of ≥ 60 steps per minute for ≥ 10 minutes) was 
employed [28]. The American College of Sports 
Medicine and American Heart Association rec­
ommended improving PA using intensity as an 
indicator for healthy adults [29], but the step 
count alone, without intensity, has also been 
employed in several reports [14, 20, 21, 30, 31]. 
We therefore considered this study, which only 
used the step count, to have merit.
The present study was associated with some 
limitations. First, the number of patients was lim­
ited. Thus, the subset analysis of the study also 
has restricted reliability. A larger patient group 
will be required to clarify the effect of providing 
a target value on the increase in the step count 
among COPD patients. Second, though this was 
a pilot study without establishing a required 
number of recruited patients, an interventional 
study with reliable number of subjects should be 
conducted in the future. Third, as the observation 
period was quite short, whether or not this effect 
can be maintained over the long term is unclear. 
Another study with a long-term follow-up period 
will be required in the future. Fourth, it is not

possible to confirm whether the patients correct­
ly described the step count in their diaries. In 
a future study, the use of pedometer with a data 
memory function might be beneficial. Fifth, 
Nakanishi’s formula has not been confirmed for 
different cohorts; thus, a further study should be 
performed to validate this formula. Finally, the 
parameters in the above-mentioned step count 
formula were limited to the age, mMRC, and IC. 
Future studies should evaluate other factors that 
might be relevant to the step count.
Conclusions
Setting and providing an individualized 
target step count that accounted for the disease 
condition and the current number of steps did not 
increase the step count in the overall population; 
however, it significantly elevated the step count 
in patients with a low step count. It significantly 
increased the target achievement rate in the over­
all population. Providing this target step count 
might be beneficial for improving PA in COPD 
patients with a low step count.
