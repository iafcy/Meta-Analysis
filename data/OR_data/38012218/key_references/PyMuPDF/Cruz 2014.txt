Abstract
Thisstudyaimedatinvestigatingwhetherprovidingfeedbackonphysicalactivity(PA)levelstopatientswithchronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is feasible and enhances daily PA during pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).
Patients with COPD participated in a 12-week PR program. Daily PA was measured using activity monitors on
weeks 1, 7, and 12, and feedback was given in the following weeks on the number of steps, time spent in sedentary,
light, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity activities, and time spent standing, sitting, and lying. Compliance with PA
monitoring was collected. Two focus groups were conducted to obtain patients’ perspectives on the use of activity
monitors and on the feedback given. Differences in PA data were also assessed. Sixteen patients (65.63 + 10.57
years; forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 70.31 + 22.74% predicted) completed the study. From
those, only eleven participants used the activity monitors during all monitoring days. Participants identified several
problems regarding the use ofactivity monitors and monitoring duration. Daily steps ( p ¼ 0.026) and standingtime
( p ¼ 0.030) were improved from week 1 to week 7; however, the former declined from week 7 to week 12. Find-
ings suggest that using feedback to improve PA during PR is feasible and results in improved daily steps and standing
time onweek7.The subsequent declinesuggests that additional strategiesmaybeneededto stimulate/maintainPA
improvements. Further research with more robust designs is needed to investigate the impact of feedback on
patients’ daily PA.

Introduction
Low levels of physical activity (PA) have been associ-
ated with increased health-care utilization and reduced
survival in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD).1 Thus, improving PA levels has
become one of the main goals of COPD research.2,3
Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an evidence-
based intervention, which includes exercise training,
education, and psychosocial support.3 The exercise
training component has been shown to improve exer-
cise capacity and reduce dyspnea;4 however, its
effects in increasing PA levels are limited.2 A recent
study showed that although a 3-month PR program
increased patients’ exercise capacity and quality of
life, changes in daily PA were restricted to a marginal

improvement in walking intensity.5 The authors sug-
gested that patients would likely require longer pro-
grams to increase their time spent actively.5
Alternatively, PA levels may be enhanced by includ-
ing behavior strategies in PR programs.3 One strategy
consists of increasing patients’ awareness of their actual
PA levels.6 In healthy adults, awareness of individual
PA is a potential determinant of the intention to increase
PA levels.7 As patients with COPD tend to overestimate
their PA levels,8 making them aware of their actual lev-
els maycontribute to improve patients’PA.Forthispur-
pose, activity monitors can be a valuable tool because
they provideobjective informationabout PA, which can
then be delivered to the patient. However, the effective
contribution of activity monitors to increase PA levels
of patients with COPD is still unclear, with the few
existing studies showing conflicting results.9–11 Differ-
ences in the devices used, PA monitoring protocols and
interventions may explain, in part, these discrepancies,
but patients’ compliance with PA monitoring and their
experience with the activity monitors may have contrib-
uted as well. These aspects are key elements to ensure
feasibility of interventions involving PA monitoring
and feedback; however, they have been understudied
in COPD research.12 Before the widespread utilization
of this technology on a larger scale, its feasibility should
be investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to investi-
gate whether providing feedback on PA levels to
patients with COPD, using activity monitors, is feasible
and enhances patients’ daily PA during PR.
Methods
Design
This was a feasibility study with a mixed methods
design. The study received full approval from the
Institutional Ethics Committee.
Participants
Patients with COPD were recruited in two primary care
centers of the central region of Portugal (Aveiro). Gen-
eral practitioners informed eligible patients about the
studyandaskedtheirwillingnesstoparticipate.Inclusion
criteria were (a) being 18 years old or older; (b) having a
diagnosis of COPD according to the Global Initiative for
Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria;4
and (c) presenting clinical stability for 1 month prior to
the study (no hospital admissions or exacerbations).
Patients were excluded if they (a) presented severe psy-
chiatric, neurologic, or musculoskeletal conditions and/
or unstable cardiovascular disease or (b) were engaged
in regular exercise before the study. Patients who agreed
toparticipatewerecontactedbythe researchers.Detailed
information about the study was provided and written
informed consent was obtained before data collection.
Intervention
The intervention was conducted between April and July
and consisted of a 12-week PR program with exercise
training (three times per week, 60 minutes/session) and
psychoeducation (once per week, 90 minutes), along
with the provision of feedback on PA levels to partici-
pants. Exercise training sessions included the following:

A warm-up period (5–10 minutes) with range-
of-motion, stretching, low-intensity aerobic
exercises, and breathing techniques.

Endurance training (20-minute walking) at
60–80% of the 6-minute walk test (6MWT)
average speed,13 with intensity adjusted to
patient’s levels of fatigue/dyspnea (4–6 in the
Modified Borg Scale).3

Strength training (15 minutes), including seven
exercises (two sets, 10 repetitions/set) of the
major muscle groups of the upper and lower
limbs, at 50–85% of the 10 repetition maxi-
mum (10-RM).14 Progression was based on the
two-for-two rule.15

Balance training (5 minutes) with static and
dynamic exercises organized in progressive
levels of difficulty.16

A cool-down period (10 minutes) similar to the
warm-up period.
The psychoeducation component included educa-
tional and supportive modules regarding information
on COPD; breathing and energy conservation tech-
niques; adoption of healthy lifestyles (exercise, nutrition,
and sleep habits); emotion management strategies; and
community resources.
PA was monitored during the first (W1), seventh
(W7), and 12th (W12) weeks of the PR program using
the activity monitors GT3Xþ (ActiGraph, Pensacola,
Florida, USA), and feedback to participants was given
in the following weeks. As these devices did not pro-
vide automatic feedback to participants, researchers
analyzed the information collected and summarized
it. Feedback was given by one of the health profes-
sionals conducting the PR program and lasted 15–20
minutes. Feedback of W1 and W7 was given at the
end of the exercise training session of the following

week (W2 and W8, respectively); feedback of W12
was given in the week following program comple-
tion. Each participant received written (graphical)
and verbal information about (a) time spent stand-
ing, sitting, and lying on each day of the week and
(b) a weekly average of the number of daily steps
and of time engaged in sedentary, light, and
moderate-to-vigorous intensity activities. On W1,
participants were instructed to maintain their rou-
tine to establish a baseline of their activity levels
and received verbal and written instructions on
how to use the device. While receiving feedback
of W1, participants were informed about the rec-
ommended
values
of
PA
for
healthy
people
(150 minutes/week or 30 minutes/day of mod-
erate intensity activities, 75 minutes/week or
20 minutes/day of vigorous intensity activities
or a combination of both, performed continuously
or accumulated in bouts of at least 10 minutes;
7000–10,000 steps/day).17 Although feedback was
given in group, each participant received individua-
lized recommendations to improve or maintain his/
her PA levels regarding the time spent in moderate-
to-vigorous intensity activities and number of steps
per day, based on the results of the previous week.
Participants also received general recommendations
to improve daily PA and a leaflet with exercises
similar to those of the exercise training component.
Feedback of W7 and W12 was similar to W1.
Data collection
Participants’ characteristics. Sociodemographic data
were collected before the intervention to character-
ize the sample. Lung function was assessed with a
portable spirometer (MicroLab 3500, CareFusion,
Kent, Dan Diego, California, USA) according to
the guidelines.18 All participants took their usual
prescribed medications before performing the lung
function test. COPD grade and severity (ranging
from group A (low risk, less symptoms) to group
D (high risk, more symptoms)) were determined
in accordance with the GOLD criteria.4 Patients’
breathlessness was measured using the Modified
Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale.19 Exer-
cise capacity was assessed with the maximal dis-
tance walked on the 6MWT.13 Two tests were
performed according to the American Thoracic
Society guidelines.20 The best performance was
reported and related to the reference values.21
Feasibility measures. Patients’ compliance with the use
of activity monitors (number of days wearing the
device, time per day) and reasons for noncompliance
were collected. In the week following the interven-
tion, two focus groups were conducted in Portuguese
to evaluate patients’ perspectives on the use of activ-
ity monitors and feedback given. Each focus group
lasted approximately 30 minutes and was audio
recorded for further transcription and analysis.
Physical activity. Daily PA was assessed using the activ-
ity monitors GT3Xþ (already validated in COPD
population)22,23 on W1, W7, and W12 of the PR pro-
gram. Participants were instructed to wear the device
for seven consecutive days during waking hours
(except when bathing or swimming) and informed
about its correct positioning, that is, at the waist on
an elastic belt at the anterior axillary line of the right
hip. Data were then downloaded using Actilife ver-
sion 6.7.2 (ActiGraph, Pensacola, Florida, USA).
Since 5 or more days of measurement are required
to reliably assess PA in COPD,24 patients with less
than 5 days in one of the time points were excluded
from PA analysis. A valid day was defined as at least
8 hours of wearing time.25 Daily PA was calculated
using the algorithms incorporated in the software
and included (a) number of steps; (b) time spent in
sedentary, light, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity
activities; and (c) time spent standing, sitting, and
lying. Cut points for PA intensity were defined as
sedentary (0–99 counts per minute (CPM)), light
(100–1951 CPM), and moderate-to-vigorous inten-
sity activities (1952–1 CPM).26 Since an increase
in exercise capacity might facilitate increases in
PA,27 the 6MWT was also performed in the week fol-
lowing program completion to assess intervention-
related differences.
Data analysis
Participants’ characteristics. Descriptive statistics were
used to characterize the sample. Baseline measure-
ments of completers and dropouts were compared
using independent t tests for normally distributed
data,
Mann–Whitney
U
tests
for
ordinal/non-
normally distributed data, and 2 tests for categorical
data. The normality of data was investigated with the
Shapiro–Wilk test. A similar analysis was conducted
to compare baseline measurements of patients with
complete and incomplete PA assessment (i.e. patients

with seven PA monitoring days vs. those without
seven monitoring days).
Feasibility measures. The number of monitoring days
missed by patients and wearing time were calculated,
and reasons for noncompliance were analyzed. Focus
group analyses were conducted by two independent
researchers using the procedures suggested by Ulin,28
namely (a) reading and rereading the transcripts; (b)
identifying possible themes; (c) displaying the infor-
mation relevant to each theme; (d) reducing the infor-
mation to its essential points; and (e) identifying its
core meaning. Any disagreements were resolved by
consensus.
Physical activity. Differences in PA data among the
three time points were assessed using a repeated mea-
sures analysis of variance (ANOVA), and pairwise
comparisons were performed whenever statistical sig-
nificance ( p < 0.05) was reached. Effect sizes (ES)
were computed using the eta squared (2), interpreted
as 0.01 (small effect), 0.06 (medium effect), and 0.14
(large effect).29 Observed power was also calculated.
A paired t test was used to assess differences in the
6-minute walking distance (6MWD) of participants
before and after the intervention. Analyses were con-
ducted using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk,
New York, USA).
Results
Participants
Twenty patients entered the study. However, four
were lost due to non-COPD health-related problems
(n ¼ 2), changes in work schedule (n ¼ 1), and no rea-
sons given (n ¼ 1). Sixteen participants completed the
intervention. Their baseline characteristics are pre-
sented in Table 1. There were no significant differ-
ences between completers and dropouts ( p > 0.05).
Feasibility measures
Eleven participants (68.8%) used the activity moni-
tors during all monitoring days. Five participants
missed 1 day (n ¼ 1, 6.3%), 2 days (n ¼ 1, 6.3%),
or 3 days (n ¼ 3, 18.8%) of PA monitoring in at
least one of the time points. Various reasons were
cited, namely, the monitor was uncomfortable to wear
in specific situations (n ¼ 1, 6.3%); failure to attend
the last week of the program due to work-related
issues (n ¼ 1, 6.3%); and forgetfulness (n ¼ 3,
18.8%). No significant differences were found in the
baseline characteristics of participants who had com-
plete and incomplete PA assessments ( p > 0.05).
Daily wearing time was similar over the weeks (W1
¼ 14.04 + 0.68 hours; W7 ¼ 13.85 + 1.92 hours;
W12 ¼ 13.40 + 1.81 hours, p ¼ 0.348).
Five participants (of 16 who completed the study)
did not attend the focus groups due to work-related
issues (n ¼ 2), schedule constraints (n ¼ 2), and no
reasons given (n ¼ 1). Focus group analyses revealed
that while five participants (45.5%) reported no diffi-
culties in using the activity monitors, six participants
(54.5%) felt that the device was uncomfortable due
to its placement and the pressure exerted by the elastic
belt:
It caused some pressure and sometimes the elastic belt
felt like scratching ( . . . ) It was placed in a region where
there is not much fat, there is mostly bone. [P1]
I used the monitor underneath the clothes and, when I
started to sweat, it felt like burning . . . . [P2]

Suggestions to improve its use consisted of changing
the elastic belt for another with a softer material (n ¼ 4,
36.4%) and changing the placement (e.g. attached to the
thigh, chest, or arm; n ¼ 4, 36.4%) or the dimensions of
the device, making it more flattened (n ¼ 2, 18.2%).
Regarding data collection, six participants (54.5%)
mentioned that there were too many days of monitor-
ing. The optimal duration for using the device would
be 3 days (n ¼ 4, 36.4%):
Sometimes it was even unnoticed, but at the end of the
third, fourth, and fifth days, it started to [bother me] . . . I
would choose to use it only for 3 days, because this was
the time that it did not really bother . . . [P3]
The feedback given to participants made them
more conscious about their PA levels, as they
found that it reflected the reality (n ¼ 8, 72.7%).
Six participants (54.5%) reported that they had
improved their active time because they were wear-
ing the devices:
Using the device made me walk more! [P4]
I tried to get out of the car when I could to avoid being
seated for so long. [P3]
Three participants (27.3%) referred that giving
daily feedback (instead of a weekly average) would
be important to allow comparisons between the activ-
ities performed on a given day and the results reported
by the device:
We should use it during the day and download [the
information] at the end of it. We would try to improve,
‘On this day I didn’t do anything . . . It was Tuesday . . .
On Tuesday, I have no chance to improve . . . ’ or ‘I will
try to improve! [P5]
Physical activity
Table 2 presents daily PA levels of patients in the
three time points. Significant differences with a large
effect were found for number of daily steps ( p ¼
0.026, 2 ¼ 0.306). Participants increased their steps
from W1 to W7 ( p ¼ 0.050), followed by a decrease
on W12 ( p ¼ 0.048). The mean time spent in
moderate-to-vigorous intensity activities was above
30 minutes/day in the three time points; however,
no significant differences were found ( p ¼ 0.167).
No changes were observed in time spent in light
intensity and sedentary activities ( p ¼ 0.685 and
p ¼ 0.673).
Regarding body postures, differences were found
for standing time ( p ¼ 0.030, 2 ¼ 0.254). Specif-
ically, improvements were observed between W1
and W7 ( p ¼ 0.021), but not between W7 and
W12 ( p ¼ 0.130). No significant differences were
found for time spent sitting ( p ¼ 0.260) or lying
( p ¼ 0.269).
Regarding
exercise
capacity,
participants’
6MWD was significantly increased after the int-
ervention (466.50 + 81.56 vs. 513.33 + 86.18,

Discussion
This study demonstrated that using feedback to
improve PA during PR is feasible and increases the
number of daily steps and standing time in the short
term. Nevertheless, there are still some issues that
should be further enhanced to stimulate and/or main-
tain PA improvements.
Overall, participants’ compliance was satisfactory,
and they reported a positive experience regarding the
use of activity monitors. Still, some participants
reported problems related to usability issues (monitor
placement and pressure exerted by the elastic belt)
and duration of PA monitoring. To date, a small num-
ber of studies have specifically addressed these issues;
however, this may have important implications for
compliance with activity monitoring30 and should
be carefully considered when planning a study. In
addition, some participants occasionally forgot to
wear the activity monitor. To overcome this problem,
future studies should implement strategies to improve
patients’ compliance, as it has been recommended in
the literature.30
Participants reported that feedback made them
more conscious about their PA levels, and PA
improvements were related to wearing the devices.
This suggests that the aim of including feedback in
PR was achieved, that is, increasing patients’ aware-
ness and motivating them to improve daily PA. Nev-
ertheless, some participants mentioned that daily
feedback would have facilitated comparisons between
the activities performed on a given day and the results
reported by the device. Activity monitors with an
automatic daily feedback function may, therefore,
be valuable to meet patients’ needs and expectations.
Pedometers include this option, but their limited accu-
racy may prevent them from detecting PA changes in
interventional studies.2 Future advances in sensing
technologies may offer opportunities to improve PA
monitoring and feedback in COPD research.
Participants improved their daily steps and stand-
ing time from W1 to W7; however, the former
declined from W7 to W12. Nevertheless, a large
effect was observed, indicating a relevant change.
These findings suggest that patients’ PA levels may
already be increased on W7 of PR programs, if appro-
priate feedback is given. However, complementary
strategies may be necessary to stimulate and/or main-
tain PA improvements, since a decline was observed
on W12. In this study, a psychoeducation session
focused on promoting exercise habits in participants
was carried out on W6, which could have acted as
an additional motivational tool to stimulate behavior
change and, thus, improve participants’ PA on W7.
Future research should explore the value of feedback
and additional strategies (e.g. psychoeducation ses-
sions about exercise habits) to stimulate patients’
behavior change into a more active lifestyle, as this
is one of the current challenges in COPD research.
Strengths and limitations
The combination of quantitative and qualitative meth-
ods of data collection is a strength of the present
study, as it enabled gathering the full experience of
participants with the use of activity monitors and pro-
vided important information for the design of future
technologies and interventions.
The small sample size and lack of control group
were limitations of this study, which may have con-
tributed to the insufficient power obtained in some
comparisons. The absence of a control group may
have acted as a confounding factor, since previous
studies have shown that PR per se is able to promote
increases in PA levels.5 Further studies with more
robust designs are needed to investigate the value of
providing feedback on PA levels to patients with
COPD during PR. In addition, patients’ PA levels
were collected on specific weeks of the PR program,
which may compromise the comparisons with previ-
ous studies. However, this was deemed necessary to
enable the provision of feedback on PA levels to par-
ticipants as part of the intervention.
Most participants were in mild and moderate
COPD grades, which differ from other intervention
studies with PA monitoring.5,9,11 Nevertheless, recent
literature has acknowledged that PA is already
reduced in early COPD grades,6,24 and PR is now con-
sidered a standard of care for all patients, including
those at earlier grades.3
The fact that feedback was only given on specific
time points may have limited participants’ PA
improvements. In addition, it was not possible to
determine whether PA levels were already increased
before W7. Future studies should explore the impact
of more regular feedback and monitoring on patients’
daily PA. Furthermore, since patients were, on aver-
age, sufficiently active on W1 (i.e. above the interna-
tionally recommended target of 7000 steps per day),17
future studies should explore whether patients who
have a lower step performance at baseline are more

motivated to change their daily steps during and after
the intervention.
The mean time spent in moderate-to-vigorous
intensity activities was above 30 minutes/day in the
three time points, which could suggest that patients
have met the international recommendations.17 How-
ever, one recent study showed that the recommended
time of moderate-to-vigorous intensity activities var-
ies upon the selected PA analysis, that is, bouts versus
non-bouts analysis.31 In the study of Van Remoortel
et al.,31 the commonly used bouts cut point of 30 min-
utes/day was associated with a non-bouts cut point of
80 minutes/day. Since this study did not conduct a
bouts analysis, it is possible that patients did not reach
the international PA target for moderate-to-vigorous
intensity activities. Future studies using bouts and
non-bouts analysis should be conducted in order to
clarify whether patients with COPD meet the interna-
tional recommendations.
Despite the limitations, results from this study
suggest that feedback on PA levels can be used to
support patients in achieving a more active lifestyle,
by helping them to self-monitor their daily PA. The
costs associated with the provision of feedback were
relatively small and related to the purchase of activ-
ity monitors and the time needed by health profes-
sionals to deliver feedback to the participants
(15–20 minutes). Therefore, this seems a feasible
intervention to be implemented in various health-
care settings. Furthermore, as lower PA levels have
been related to increased health-care utilization,
poorer quality of life, and reduced survival of
patients with COPD,32–34 it is reasonable to believe
that this type of intervention may lead to reduced
COPD health-related costs. This should be investi-
gated in future research.
Conclusions
Providing feedback on PA levels to patients with
COPD is feasible and may enhance daily PA during
PR. However, additional strategies might be neces-
sary to stimulate patients’ behavior change to a more
active lifestyle, as this is one of the current chal-
lenges in COPD research. Patients’ experiences on
the use of activity monitors should also be assessed,
as they provide valuable information to adjust PA
technologies and interventions to the target popula-
tion. Further research with more robust designs is
needed to investigate the impact of feedback on
patients’ daily PA.
