1. Introduction
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized
by cough, phlegm, dyspnea, decreased exercise tolerance and
exacerbations. COPD patients may enter a downward spiral of
symptom-induced inactivity leading to lack of ﬁtness and a reduced
quality of life. It has been demonstrated that during 1 day, COPD
patients spend more time sitting and lying down and less standing
and walking than age-matched healthy controls [1]. To reverse this
vicious circle of inactivity it is important to prevent the decrease in
daily physical activity or even to enhance it.
Enhancement of low-to-moderate-intensity daily physical activ-
ity has proven to be effective in strengthening health-related ﬁtness
and quality of life in healthy older adults [2,3]. Because COPD
patients frequently suffer from ventilatory limitations and oxygen
uptake problems, low-to-moderate-intensity physical activities
seem an appropriate level to enhance their physical ﬁtness [4]. To
monitor enhancement of daily physical activity pedometers have
shown to be effective in healthy people as well as in various patients
groups [5–8]. Pedometers are also key in triggering enhancement
of daily physical activity [9–12]. In addition, exercise counseling
has shown to be effective in tailoring the needs and circumstances
of individual patients in the process of behavioral modiﬁcation
[13,14].
In this study, we investigated whether a 12-week pedometer-
based exercise counseling strategy is feasible and effectively en-
hances daily physical activity in COPD patients who do not part-
icipate in a rehabilitation program.

Objective: To investigate whether a 12-week pedometer-based exercise counseling strategy is feasible
and effectively enhances daily physical activity in outclinic Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD) patients who do not participate in a rehabilitation program in a controlled way.
Methods: 35 outclinic COPD patients (21 males, mean age 62 years, GOLD I–III, mean FEV1% predicted
64.7) were randomized for a 12-week individual pedometer-based exercise counseling program
promoting daily physical activities or usual care. Daily physical activity (DigiWalker SW-200), physical
ﬁtness, health-related quality of life, self-efﬁcacy, fatigue, depression and motivation to be physically
active were assessed before and after the intervention.
Results: After the intervention, COPD patients in the exercise counseling group showed a signiﬁcant
increase in their mean number of steps/day (from 7087 to 7872), whereas the usual care group showed a
decrease (from 7539 to 6172). Signiﬁcant differences favoring the exercise counseling group were
demonstrated in arm strength, leg strength, health-related quality of life and intrinsic motivation to be
physically active.
Conclusion: Our study shows that a 12-week pedometer-based exercise counseling strategy is feasible
and effectively enhances daily physical activity, physical ﬁtness, health-related quality of life and intrinsic
motivation in outclinic COPD patients who do not participate in a rehabilitation program.
Practice implications: The feasibility of our exercise counseling strategy is good and patients were
motivated to participate.

2. Methods
2.1. Participants and recruitment
Patients with stable COPD visiting the outpatient clinic of the
pulmonary department of Wilhelmina Hospital in Assen were
approached to participate in this study. Inclusion criteria were
diagnosis of COPD and age between 45 and 75 years. Exclusion
criterion was signiﬁcant comorbidity interfering with physical
activity. The study was approved by the local medical ethical
committee of University Medical Centre Groningen and all patients
signed a written informed consent.
2.2. Measurements
All measurements were taken at baseline and following the
intervention period.
- Daily
physical
activity
was
measured
with
a
pedometer
(Digiwalker SW-2000 (Yamax; Tokyo, Japan)) [10].
- Pulmonary function was measured using a spirometer (Jaeger
MS-IOS) according to standardized guidelines [15].
- Physical ﬁtness: leg strength was measured by the chair-stand-
test [16,17], arm strength by the arm-curl-test [16,17], grip force
by a handheld dynamometer and cardiorespiratory endurance by
the 6-min walking test [18].
- Health-related quality of life was measured by the Clinical COPD
Questionnaire and the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire
[19,20]. Health status was measured by the SF-36 [21].
- Fatigue was measured by the Dutch Exertion Fatigue Scale [22].
- Depression was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory [23].
- Self-efﬁcacy was measured by the LIVAS [24,25].
- Motivation to be physically active was measured by the Exercise
Self-Regulation Questionnaire.
2.3. Intervention
Patients were randomly assigned to an exercise counseling or a
usual care group. The exercise counseling group participated in a
12-week customized exercise counseling program designed to
enhance daily physical activity in COPD patients [26]. Patients
started the program in the late summer and ﬁnished it in the early
winter. The exercise counseling program was given by a trained
exercise counselor (the ﬁrst author) and is predominantly based on
the principles of goal setting and implementation of goals [27].
Motivational interviewing technique [28] is used as counseling
technique. A pedometer, worn all day during the intervention
period, was used to monitor and support motivation to participate.
Aim of the exercise counseling was to motivate COPD patients to
enhance daily physical activities and to develop a more physically
active lifestyle. Five individually tailored exercise counseling
sessions took place during 12 weeks (Table 1). Each session lasted
approximately 30 min.
Patients in the usual care group received usual care and wore
the pedometer for 2 weeks at baseline and 10 weeks after baseline.
2.4. Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Scientiﬁc Package
of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 14.0. The Mann–Whitney U-test
and the Chi-square test were used to analyze baseline character-
istics. A factorial ANOVA (group  time) was used to examine the
effect of the intervention. Effect sizes were computed [32] and a
power analysis was calculated [33]. To test the null hypothesis
alpha was set at 0.05 and beta at 0.80.
3. Results
The ﬂow of participants through the study is shown in Fig. 1.
Descriptive characteristics at baseline are shown in Table 2.
3.1. Primary outcome measure
The exercise counseling group increased its mean number of
steps/day by 11% (Table 3). By contrast, the usual care group
showed a decrease in their mean steps/day of 18%. In the exercise
counseling group about 56% of the participants showed an
increase, while in the usual care group 29% showed an increase
in mean number of steps/day. This difference was signiﬁcant.
3.2. Secondary outcome measure
The exercise counseling group, as compared to the usual care
group, showed a beneﬁcial signiﬁcant effect on leg strength and
arm strength (Table 3). Moreover, a signiﬁcant improvement was
found on quality of life and changes in intrinsic motivation score.
No signiﬁcant differences were found for fatigue, health status,
depression and self-efﬁcacy. Controlled for number of steps/day at
baseline, the results of a factorial ANOVA showed a signiﬁcant
increase in only leg strength in the exercise counseling group
compared to the usual care group.

physical activity, physical ﬁtness, health-related quality of life and
intrinsic motivation in COPD patients who do not participate in a
rehabilitation program.
COPD patients in the exercise counseling group increased their
number of steps by 11%. COPD patients who took less than 10,000
steps/day at baseline increased their number of steps by about
19%. This corresponds with about 20 min walking per day. Still, a
mean number of 6124 steps post-program is far below the
arbitrary cut-off point of 10,000 steps/day for healthy adults. For
physically active COPD patients (>10,000 steps/day at baseline)
who participated in the exercise counseling group the number of
steps did consolidate. Contrary, physically active participants in
the usual care group demonstrated a dramatic fall in number of
steps/day by 21%. One might suggest that this dramatic fall is due
to a seasonal effect [34,35]. Patients started the program in the late
summer and ﬁnished it in the early winter. It is conceivable that
physically active COPD patients reduce their outside physical
activities in the early winter because of bad weather.
The increase in daily physical activity level of COPD patients in
the exercise counseling group is supported by a systematic review
study of Bravata et al. [14], who show pedometer users signiﬁcantly
increased their physical activity by 2491 more steps/day than
control participants (95% conﬁdence interval 1098–3885 steps/day,
P = .001). In our study the difference between the exercise coun-
seling and usual care group is 2152 steps/day.
Sedentary COPD patients in the exercise counseling group show
signiﬁcant improvement of leg strength and arm strength. Appar-
ently, enhancing daily activities provide an adequate training
stimulus, at least in COPD patients with a decreased active lifestyle.
The 6-min walking test improved by 26 m in the exercise counseling
group, compared to 10 m in the usual care group. Both changes are
below the minimal clinically relevant change. Nevertheless, we
hypothesize that for the exercise counseling group the 6-min
walking test will further improve if patients stick to their new
lifestyle.
The question arises whether pedometer-based counseling
programs should be used as an alternative to regular pulmonary
rehabilitation programs, especially for COPD patients who cannot
beneﬁt from regular pulmonary rehabilitation due to budgetary
restrictions. In our opinion, the beneﬁts of an exercise counseling
strategy are evident: it is our experience, also in other settings, that
patients can incorporate the daily physical activities into their
regular life; and different caregivers can be trained to give exercise
counseling. Nevertheless, we realize that speciﬁc COPD patients,
like those severely deconditioned, really need the multidis-
ciplinary approach of a pulmonary rehabilitation program. We
previously published a study in which we enhanced daily physical
activity in COPD patients in pulmonary rehabilitation, using the
same exercise counseling strategy. We showed that our exercise
counseling strategy was feasible next to pulmonary rehabilitation

[26]. In our opinion, pulmonary rehabilitation and exercise coun-
seling may act complementarily and synergistically.
5. Conclusion
Our study shows that a 12-week pedometer-based exercise
counseling strategy is feasible and effectively enhances daily
physical activity, physical ﬁtness, health-related quality of life and
intrinsic motivation in outclinic COPD patients.
5.1. Practice implications
Pedometers are simple in use, and the feasibility of the
counseling program is good. Patients were motivated to participate
in this study, and the dropout rate is low. The strengths of the study
are the feasibility and effectiveness of the exercise counseling
strategy in sedentary COPD patients. Especially the signiﬁcant
increase in daily physical activity and leg strength are amenities of
this study. Limitation of the study is the lack of long-term follow-up.
