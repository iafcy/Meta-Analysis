Abstract
Rationale: Increasing physical activity is a key therapeutic aim in
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Pulmonary
rehabilitation(PR)improvesexercisecapacity,butthereisconﬂicting
evidence regarding its ability to improve physical activity levels.
Objectives: TodeterminewhetherusingpedometersasanadjuncttoPR
canenhancetimespentinatleastmoderate-intensityphysicalactivity(time
expending >3 metabolic equivalents [METs]) by people with COPD.
Methods: In this single-blind randomized controlled trial,
participants were assigned 1:1 to receive a control intervention (PR
comprising 8 wk, two supervised sessions per week) or the trial
intervention (PR plus pedometer-directed step targets, reviewed
weekly for 8 wk). In the randomization process, we used
minimization to balance groups for age, sex, FEV1 percent predicted,
and baseline exercise capacity and physical activity levels. Outcome
assessors and PR therapists were blinded to group allocation. The
primary analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle.
Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was
change from baseline to 8 weeks in accelerometer-measured daily
time expending at least 3 METs. A total of 152 participants (72%
male; mean [SD] FEV1 percent predicted, 50.5% [21.2]; median
[ﬁrst quartile, third quartile] time expending >3 METs, 46 [21, 92]
min) were enrolled and assigned to the intervention (n = 76) or
control (n = 76) arm. There was no signiﬁcant difference in change
in time expending at least 3 METs between the intervention and
control groups at 8 weeks (median [ﬁrst quartile, third quartile]
difference, 0.5 [21.0, 31.0] min; P = 0.87) or at the 6-month follow-
up (7.0 [29, 27] min; P = 0.16).
Conclusions: Pedometer-directed step-count targets during an
outpatient PR program did not enhance moderate-intensity physical
activity levels in people with COPD.

Increasing physical activity levels is a key
therapeutic aim in chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) (1) because
physical inactivity is associated with
increased risk of mortality and
exacerbations, greater decline in lung
function, and impaired quality of life (2–4).
There is strong evidence for the
effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation
(PR) in improving exercise capacity in
COPD (5), but the effect of PR on physical
activity levels is modest (6).
Pedometers may help people to become

controlled trials involving 2,767 outpatients
found pedometer use was associated with
a signiﬁcant increase in physical activity
levels (7). In a recent, single-center
randomized controlled trial among patients
with stable COPD, a pedometer-based
physical activity program led to
signiﬁcantly greater improvement in
physical activity levels, exercise capacity,
and quality of life compared with simple
encouragement to be more active (8). In
contrast, Burtin and colleagues showed that
the addition of simple physical activity
counseling alone did not enhance the
effects of PR on physical activity levels (9).
We postulated that pedometers could
enhance the effects of PR on physical activity
levels. To date, three small randomized
controlled trials have explored the effect of
pedometers as an adjunct to PR (10–12).
The results were conﬂicting, reﬂecting
intervention heterogeneity and trial
methodologies. The trials were also
underpowered (n = 16–39) and at high risk
of effect size error and sample bias (10–12).
The aim of the present trial was to
determine the short- and medium-term
effectiveness of pedometer-directed step
targets as an adjunct to outpatient PR in
improving physical activity levels, exercise
capacity, and health-related quality of
life in people with stable, symptomatic
COPD. We hypothesized that the use of
pedometers would enhance the short- and
medium-term effects of PR on physical
activity levels, exercise capacity, and
health-related quality of life.
Methods
Trial Design and Participants
We conducted a parallel, two-group,
assessor-blinded randomized controlled
trial to investigate the effect of a pedometer
intervention during and following PR on
physical activity levels in people with
COPD. Recruitment took place within
the Hareﬁeld Hospital Pulmonary
Rehabilitation Unit (Hareﬁeld, UK) between
July 2012 and June 2014 with patients
undergoing an initial PR assessment.
Eligible participants were at least 35 years
of age, had a physician’s diagnosis of
COPD consistent with the Global Initiative
for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
(GOLD) criteria (13), had a Medical
Research Council dyspnea scale score
greater than or equal to 2, and consented
to undergo supervised PR. Exclusion
criteria included contraindications to
exercise (e.g., signiﬁcant cardiovascular
comorbidities) or participants choosing a
community PR site without access to
specialist exercise equipment. All
participants provided written informed
consent. The trial protocol was
preregistered with clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT01719822) and approved by the
West London Research Ethics Committee
(reference 11/LO/1021).
Randomization and Blinding
Following baseline assessment, participants
were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive usual
care or usual care plus the pedometer
intervention. The allocation sequence
was computer generated (Minim; Stephen
Evans, Simon Day, and Patrick Royston,
UK) and accessed by a researcher
independent of the recruitment process, PR
program provision, trial intervention, and
outcome assessment. Minimization was
used to balance groups for age (<65 yr vs.
.65 yr), sex (male vs. female), GOLD stage
(I–II vs. III–IV), incremental shuttle walk
test (ISWT) distance (,170 m vs. >170 m),
oxygen use (yes vs. no), and physical
activity level (,1.4 vs. >1.4) (14). It was
not possible to conceal group allocation
from participants. Subsequent assessment
visits were completed immediately after the
PR program (8 wk) and 6 months after
the end of the PR program by assessors
blinded to group allocation. The statistician
undertaking the primary statistical analysis
(W.B.) was blinded to group allocation.
Intervention
Usual care was a standardized, twice-weekly,
supervised, 8-week outpatient PR program
(see online supplement). The additional
intervention was provision of a pedometer
(Yamax Digi-walker CW700; Yamax,
Bridgnorth, UK), an individualized daily
pedometer step-count target (with weekly
review for 8 wk), and a step-count diary
provided during the PR program and the
following 6 months. During PR, the daily
pedometer step-count target was an increase
of 5% on the preceding week’s average daily
pedometer step count, with the ﬁrst week’s
target derived from the baseline pre-PR
assessment (e.g., 250 additional steps from a
mean daily step count of 5,000). At this
weekly step-count review, each patient was
counseled on the importance of achieving
the pedometer step count and given advice
on how to increase physical activity levels,
focusing on barriers and opportunities arising
during daily life. On completion of the PR
program, participants in the intervention
group received a ﬁnal step-count target
based on a 20% increase in daily step
count from the baseline pre-PR assessment
and a step-count diary. The detailed
intervention protocol is described in the
online supplement.
Outcomes
Participants wore an accelerometer
(SenseWear; Body Media Inc., Pittsburgh,
PA) and a pedometer for 7 days at the
baseline, immediate post-PR, and 6-month
follow-up assessment visits. Data recorded
by the accelerometer included mean daily
step count and time spent performing
moderate-intensity physical activity (time
expending >3 metabolic equivalents
[METs]) (4, 15, 16). The pedometer
measured daily step count, and participants
noted this number in the trial diary. Further
information on the accelerometer and
At a Glance Commentary
Scientiﬁc Knowledge on the
Subject: Despite the strong evidence
base for pulmonary rehabilitation (PR)
to improve exercise capacity in people
with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), the effect on physical
activity levels is uncertain. To date,
researchers in three small randomized
controlled trials have examined the
effect of pedometer use by patients with
COPD undergoing PR, with conﬂicting
results. Methodologies and
intervention strategies used in these
studies varied, and the studies were
underpowered and had a high risk of
effect size error and sample bias.
What This Study Adds to the
Field: This trial contributes high-
quality evidence demonstrating that
the routine use of pedometer feedback
and step targets does not augment the
effects of PR on physical activity levels,
exercise capacity, or health-related
quality of life of patients with COPD.
Pedometers might limit the effect of PR
on some aspects of quality of life in the
short term, reﬂecting the added burden
of using the pedometer on a daily basis.

pedometer is provided in the online
supplement.
Additional assessments included
spirometry, functional exercise capacity
measured using the ISWT (17), and
health status assessed with the Chronic
Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). To
gather feedback on pedometer use,
participants allocated to the intervention
completed a telephone survey after the
6-month assessment. Questions in the
survey concerned positive and negative
attributes of using the pedometer, physical
activity undertaken after the study, and
ideas that might motivate participants to
exercise.
The primary outcome was change in
daily time spent in at least moderate-
intensity physical activity (time expending
>3 METs) from baseline to immediately
following PR. Secondary outcomes were
change in time expending at least 3 METs
at 6 months following PR and change in
accelerometer and pedometer step counts,
ISWT, and CRQ domain and total scores.
Adverse events, hospitalizations, and deaths
were recorded throughout the trial.

Statistical Analysis
Our sample size was based on a previous
study which demonstrated that a 3-month
PR program increased the average daily
walking time assessed using an
accelerometer by a mean (SD) of 7% (35)
(18). We assumed that an additional
increase in moderate-intensity physical
activity of 20% would represent a clinically
relevant improvement. To detect this using
a two-sample t test with 80% power at
the 0.05 signiﬁcance level (two-sided),
assuming equal variances, a total of 50
participants per group was required. On the
basis of PR studies of similar duration, we
allowed for attrition during PR (22%) and
from PR to 6 months post-PR (33%) and
planned to recruit 155 participants overall.
Data were exported from a Microsoft
Ofﬁce Access 2010 database (Microsoft,
Redmond, WA), and analysis was
completed by the trial statistician (W.B.)
using Stata 14.1 software (StataCorp LP,
College Station, TX). The prespeciﬁed
primary analysis was based on the intention-
to-treat principle. Missing data were
explored and reported according to cause
(19). Missing data were handled by a
Markov chain Monte Carlo method, using
multiple imputations (10 datasets). Data
were assumed to be from a multivariate
normal, and data augmentation was
applied to Bayesian inference with
missing data. The data were log
transformed for multiple imputation
and then antilogged.
Continuous data were expressed as
means with SDs or 95% conﬁdence intervals
and were compared between groups
with unpaired Student’s t tests (20).
Nonnormally distributed data were
expressed as median (ﬁrst quartile [Q1],
third quartile [Q3]) and compared between
groups with the Mann-Whitney U test (20).
Categorical data were presented as

percentages and were compared between
groups with Pearson’s x2 test (20).
Outcomes were summarized as change
from baseline. We used independent
samples Student’s t tests (two-sided) or the
Mann-Whitney U test to compare change
in time expending at least 3 METs in
physical activity (primary outcome) and
secondary outcomes immediately and 6
months following PR, by trial group (20).
In sensitivity analysis, we considered
complete cases only (i.e., with paired
observations) to account for the possible
impact of data imputation (Table E1 in the
online supplement) and participants’ not
achieving at least 150 minutes of moderate-
intensity physical activity each week at
baseline. A P value less than 0.05 indicated
statistical signiﬁcance. Telephone survey
data were handled using the Microsoft
Ofﬁce Excel 2010 database, and content
analysis was used to explore participants’
experience of the intervention. We
identiﬁed categories inductively from the
interview data, with attention to terms and
content.
Results
Patient Flow
Figure 1 shows the Consolidated Standards
of Reporting Trials ﬂowchart. In total, 155
people provided consent, and 152 were
randomized. Their baseline characteristics
are shown in Table 1.
Outcomes were obtained for 122
(80.3%) and 113 (74.3%) participants at the
immediate post-PR and 6-month follow-up
assessments, respectively, with similar
attrition rates across groups (Figure 1).
The planned intervention offered eight
opportunities (each week of PR) for a
new step-count target to be set using 5%
increments. In the intervention group,
participants did not increase their target by
5% on a mean (SD) of 5 (10) occasions
during PR, because these participants
missed their PR session, could not be
contacted by telephone, or the previous
week’s target was not met.
Valid accelerometer data for the primary
outcome measure were available for 92
participants at the immediate post-PR
assessment (intervention group, n = 46;
control group, n = 46) and for 93 participants
at the 6-month follow-up assessment
(intervention group, n = 44; control group,
n = 49). The reasons for missing accelerometer
data are provided in Table E1. Missing data
and dropouts were not associated with
baseline age, sex, FEV1 percent predicted,
exercise capacity, CRQ score, or group
allocation, and they were considered missing
at random. Consequently, multiple imputation
was performed for the primary outcome, and
analyses involved all randomly assigned
participants.
Primary Outcome
Table 2 and Figure 2 show change in time
expending at least 3 METs from baseline to 8
weeks and from baseline to 6 months following
the PR program. We found no signiﬁcant
between-group differences in time expending
at least 3 METs from baseline to 8 weeks
(median [Q1, Q3] change in intervention
group, 11 [21, 33] min; vs. control group,
11 [22, 28] min; P = 0.62). Similarly, no
signiﬁcant between-group differences in
change in time expending at least 3 METs were
observed at 6 months (intervention group,
2 [212, 25] min; vs. control group, 12 [27, 31]
min; P = 0.16) (Table 2 and Figure 2). This
ﬁnding was consistent when only complete
cases were considered (Table E2).
Secondary Outcomes
Figure 3 shows the overall progression in
daily pedometer step count achieved during
PR in the intervention group. The median
(Q1, Q3) step-count target for the ﬁnal
week of PR was 36% (0, 76) higher than
participants’ baseline step count.
Consistent with the ﬁndings for the
primary outcome measure, there were
no signiﬁcant between-group differences
for accelerometer-recorded step count,
pedometer-recorded step count, or ISWT
at either time point (Table 2). At all time
points, the median accelerometer-recorded
daily step count was greater than the
pedometer-recorded step count, with the

in CRQ scores following PR were signiﬁcantly
greater in the control group than in the
intervention group for the fatigue (P , 0.01)
and mastery (P = 0.047) domains as well as
the total score (P , 0.01). We also adjusted
for baseline CRQ values, and the group effect
for differences in the fatigue domain and total
scores remained signiﬁcant (Table E3).
However, between-group differences in CRQ
did not persist at 6 months.
Given recent insights suggesting that
the effects of adjunct interventions during
PR depend on their being offered in a
targeted manner (22), we undertook a post
hoc sensitivity analysis considering only the
38 (25%) of 152 participants with low
baseline physical activity levels (<150 min
of moderate-intensity physical activity each
week), as per international guidelines (23, 24).
The ﬁnding for the primary outcome did not
change at 8 weeks (median [Q1, Q3] change,
10 [2, 18] min vs. 10 [6, 15] min; P = 0.20) or
at the 6-month follow-up (2 [21, 25] min vs.
14 [5, 31] min; P = 0.52) (Table 3). There
were no longer signiﬁcant differences in CRQ
scores following PR, suggesting that the
pedometer intervention blunts CRQ response
to PR principally in those with higher levels
of physical activity at trial entry (Table 3).
Data for patients achieving at least 150
minutes of moderate-intensity physical
activity per week are presented in Table E4.
The survey feedback on the pedometer
was mixed. Some participants felt positive
about the intervention. For example,
respondents stated that “it was interesting to
get feedback . good to push myself” and
that the pedometer provided “an incentive to
go walking,” whereas others reported issues
with its use, such as that “it needed to be
clipped onto a waistband and so it was
impossible to wear a dress” and “it didn’t pick
up all of my steps.” Others revealed that they
could “alter [the step count] by shaking
[the pedometer].” Some participants reported
that they stopped using the pedometer
following PR owing to a change in clinical
condition, such as after an exacerbation (“I
had a really bad chest infection.. as I
couldn’t leave the house, I didn’t see the point
in wearing it”) or perception of its role (“I
stopped because I became obsessed with the
step count target”). On completion of PR,
participants reported that their physical
activity levels tended to decline because of
lack of incentive to exercise or becoming
unwell with a chest infection.
The proportion of participants
experiencing adverse events during and
following PR was similar between groups. One
participant experienced an allergic reaction to
the nickel baseplate of the accelerometer
during baseline assessments and as a result was
not randomized. In total, there were 56
hospital admissions (intervention group,
n = 23; control group, n = 33; P = 0.50). Thirty
of these admissions were for COPD
(intervention group, n = 14; control group,
n = 16 ; P = 0.29). Four deaths (two in each
group) were recorded during the study period.

Contrary to our hypothesis, this single-blind
randomized controlled trial demonstrated that

enhance the short- or medium-term effects of
PR on moderate-intensity physical activity
levels, daily step count, exercise capacity, or
health-related quality of life in people with
COPD. Indeed, there was evidence that the
intervention was associated with a reduced
improvement in some aspects of health-
related quality of life with PR, though this
difference did not persist at 6 months.
To our knowledge, in two previous trials
(10, 12) and a substudy of a larger trial (11),
researchers have examined the use of
pedometers as an adjunct to PR. Findings
have been conﬂicting, which may reﬂect
intervention heterogeneity and small sample
sizes. Our study bears similarities to that
described by Kawagoshi and colleagues
(12). Pedometer feedback was the main
intervention in their study, whereas an
accelerometer was used to objectively measure
physical activity levels. There was limited
physical activity counseling other than simple
monthly verbal reinforcement to increase
physical activity. Unlike us, Kawagoshi and
colleagues were able to demonstrate a
signiﬁcant between-group difference in
walking time in favor of the intervention
group at 1 year (12). However, only 27
patients completed the study, no attempt was
made to impute missing data, and the PR
program was home based, of low intensity,
and minimally supervised. In the study by
de Blok and colleagues, the intervention
consisted primarily of four individual exercise-
counseling sessions, with pedometers used as
motivational and feedback tools (10). This
study was very underpowered (only 16
patients in total completed it), and the
randomization process was not well described.
Although both intervention and control
groups showed a signiﬁcant increase in
daily step count, there were no statistically
signiﬁcant between-group differences (10). In
a larger trial, Altenburg and colleagues also
studied the effects of a lifestyle physical activity
counseling program in outpatients with
stable COPD (11). The intervention included
pedometers used as motivational and feedback
tools. In a subgroup analysis of patients
undergoing PR, the authors demonstrated a
short-term additive improvement in daily step
count with the intervention, but this did not
persist at 15 months (11). There are marked
differences between their study and ours. First,
the Altenburg study cohort was considerably
younger (mean age, 54 yr vs. 68 yr) and had
more severe airway obstruction (mean FEV1
percent predicted, 43% vs. 50%). Second, the
PR substudy population was considerably
smaller, with only 37 and 23 patients
providing data at 3 months and 15 months,
respectively, and no attempt to impute missing
data. Third, the primary outcome in the
Altenburg study was pedometer step count,
which has signiﬁcant limitations; our choice of
a multisensory accelerometer is considered a

more accurate measure of physical activity.
Finally, there were differences in baseline
physical activity parameters between the
control and intervention groups of the PR
substudy. This was not corrected for in the
between-group difference analysis.
Four randomized controlled trials and
two uncontrolled interventional studies
outside of PR, using pedometers and either a
physical activity counseling program (8, 11, 25)
or an Internet-mediated, pedometer-
based program (26–28), have generally been
positive by showing improvements in daily
pedometer step count. A number of
possibilities may account for the difference in
physical activity outcomes between our study
and these other studies. Our study used an
accelerometer to assess the impact of the
intervention on physical activity, whereas
the aforementioned studies employed
pedometers. The capacity of pedometers to
reliably measure physical activity is disputed,
owing to inconsistent construct and
convergent validity and reliability at slow
walking speeds, as well as the ability to
manipulate the step count by shaking the
device (21, 29–32). Three of the studies
(25, 27, 28) were small (range, 24–35
participants), and only two of the studies
provided a sample size calculation (8, 11). The
contact time with healthcare professionals was
greater in the aforementioned studies, with
time periods ranging from 12 to 52 weeks
(25, 26) in contrast to 8 weeks in our study.
Furthermore, only one study in addition to
ours assessed the medium-term impact of the
intervention on physical activity levels (33).
There were a number of important
secondary ﬁndings in the present study. The
use of a pedometer appeared to blunt the
effects of PR on some health-related quality-
of-life domains. This may reﬂect the added
burden of using a pedometer and step-count
diary, as evidenced by some negative feedback
in the qualitative interviews. The reduction in
pedometer step count from Week 8 of the PR
program to post-PR assessment is noteworthy
because it suggests that participants rapidly
became more sedentary on stopping PR. This
was further compounded by the consistent
drop in physical activity levels from
immediately after PR to 6 months post-PR in
both groups, which may indicate that an
8-week outpatient PR program is insufﬁcient
to elicit long-term behavior change (34).
Strengths of our study include the use of
randomization and an intention-to-treat
analysis to limit the risk of bias, as well as an
adequate sample size to test our a priori
hypothesis. Our study is the largest trial done
to explore the adjunct use of pedometers
during PR. Outcome assessors and PR staff
were blinded to group allocation, and,
although owing to the nature of the
intervention it was not possible to do this with
the trial participants, the primary outcome of
objective, accelerometer-recorded physical
activity parameters partly mitigated this source
of bias (35). Importantly, these data were
measured independently of the intervention
device. Our assessment of outcomes
immediately and 6 months following PR was
rigorous, allowing us to examine both short-
and medium-term effects of the intervention.
There are limitations to consider. Our a
priori sample size calculation required
50 subjects in both the intervention and
control groups to complete at the
immediate post-PR time point. There was
an unexpectedly great amount of invalid or
missing data from the accelerometer, and
primary outcome measure data were
available for only 46 pedometer and 46
control subjects, so the study may be
underpowered. However, imputation of
accelerometer data partly mitigated this
problem. In addition, there was wide
variability in physical activity levels
measured using the accelerometer. A
number of different methods of analyzing
physical activity data exist. At the time of
study planning, we prespeciﬁed the then-
recommended method of Watz and
colleagues (4), which involves analyzing
5 days of data: 3 weekdays and 2 weekend
days. However, recent data from Demeyer
and colleagues (36) recommend analyzing 4
weekdays with at least 8 hours of data and
considering daylight time to help reduce
variability. With hindsight, a greater focus
on the behavioral aspects may have
produced more positive results in our trial,
but we note a recent trial by Burtin and
colleagues (9), who used a comprehensive
physical activity behavioral program (eight
individual activity counseling sessions
without pedometer feedback) alongside PR
as their intervention. Like our study, this
study failed to show an additional beneﬁt
regarding physical activity levels compared
with PR alone. In the PR setting, de Blok
and colleagues also failed to augment the
beneﬁts of PR with a combined approach
of physical activity counseling with
pedometer feedback (10). However, our
intention was to design an intervention that
is pragmatic and feasible to implement
easily within a standard PR program
without a signiﬁcant increase in staff time,
and that would encourage patient self-
management.
Conclusions
The study ﬁndings indicate that pedometer-
directed step targets do not enhance the effects
of PR on short- or medium-term physical
activity levels, exercise capacity, or health-
related quality of life. These data do not
support the routine use of pedometers to
augment physical activity during PR programs.
In light of this, studies investigating alternative
methods to enhance physical activity are
necessary to realize physical activity–associated
health and economic beneﬁts for people with
COPD attending PR. n
