Summary
Purpose: We evaluated the effects of low-intensity and home-based pulmonary rehabilitation
(PR) on physical activity (PA) and the feedback provided by a pedometer in stable elderly pa-
tients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Methods: We assessed PA using a newly developed triaxial accelerometer (A-MES, Kumamo-
to, Japan), which measures the time spent walking, standing, sitting and lying down. Twenty-
seven elderly patients with COPD (age 74  8 yrs; %FEV1 56.6  18.7%) participated. They were
randomly selected to undergo PR (pulmonary rehabilitation only) or PR þ P (PR plus the feed-
back from using a pedometer). Their PA and pulmonary function, exercise capacity (6-min
walking distance; 6MWD), quadriceps femoris muscle force (QF) were evaluated before the
PR began (baseline) and at 1 year later. We compared the patients’ changes in PA and other
factors between the baseline values and those obtained 1 year later and analyzed the

relationships between the changes in PA and other factors in the both groups.
Results: The increase in the time spent walking in the PR þ P group (51.3  63.7 min/day) was
signiﬁcantly greater than that of PR group (12.3  25.5 min/day) after the PR. The improve-
ment rate of daily walking time after PR was signiﬁcantly correlated with that of the 6MWD
and QF in all subjects.
Conclusions: These data suggest that low-intensity and home-based PR with the feedback from
using pedometer was effective in improving PA, and the improvements of physiological factors
were correlated with increased walking time in stable elderly patients with COPD.

Introduction
The progress of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) causes breathlessness, disability, and frequent
hospitalization, and is associated with a reduction in
physical activity (PA). It is known that the level of PA is an
independent prognostic factor for mortality and hospitali-
zation due to the severe exacerbation of COPD [1]. The
primary goal of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has been to
break the downward spiral of breathlessness, disability and
inactivity that leads to deconditioning. The Global Initiative
for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guideline
states that PA is recommended for all patients with COPD to
improve their exercise capacity and decrease their dyspnea
and fatigue [2].
The previous studies and guideline note that PR is bene-
ﬁcial for COPD patients as it improves exercise capacity,
muscle force, symptoms, and health-related quality of life
[2,3]. However, it has been reported that various types of PR
had little or no effect on PA in COPD patients [4]. The evi-
dence that increased PA is achieved through participation in
PR is inconclusive. Some studies reported that PR had the
immediate effect of increasing PA, but no long-term effects
that could maintain the subjects’ PA [5,6]. Agarwal et al.
proposed that a longitudinal exercise program in addition to
PR may be required for COPD patients [7].
These studies also suggested that alternative methods
that affect behavior to increase daily physical activity are
needed [8,9]. For example, bimonthly phone calls to sub-
jects to provide motivational support for improving their
activity were tested [8]. The effect of a counseling program
with feedback from a pedometer during PR was shown to
improve the patients’ outcome and maintenance of reha-
bilitation [9]. A PR program we devised consists of home-
based exercise at low intensity, nutrition counseling and
weekly education sessions; we found that this program
improves the participants’ exercise capacity and other
health status factors [10,11]. This program has been used
for COPD patients who can come to our hospital. It may be
effective for maintaining their conditioning, including
physical activity.
Pedometers are easy to use and have been found to
enhance PA and contribute to the maintenance of PA as a
feedback tool [9,12]. Thus, the objective of the present
study was to evaluate the effect of our PR program over a
long term with or without the feedback of daily pedometer
use by patients with COPD.
Methods
Subjects and study design
Forty-two patients who were diagnosed with stable COPD
from mild to very severe stage (GOLD) [13] were enrolled in
the present study. The patients were all retired. The in-
clusion criteria for this study were: (1) the patient was in
stable condition with no infection or exacerbation of COPD
for at least the prior 3 months; (2) the patient was able to
walk unassisted and operate the device to measure their PA;
(3) the patient had no severe and/or unstable cardiac dis-
ease, orthopedic disease, or mental disorder that could
impair physical activities in daily life. The objective and
content of the study were orally explained to the partici-
pants, with additional documents. Written consent was ob-
tained after all patients were informed that they could
decide whether or not to participate based on their own free
will and that their privacy would be sufﬁciently considered.
The
trial
design
was
a
prospective,
randomized,
controlled trial (Fig. 1). The patients were randomly
assigned to one of two groups: the PR (pulmonary rehabili-
tation only) or PR þ P (Pulmonary rehabilitation and feed-
back from using a pedometer) group. Patients were not
blinded to the randomization. This study followed the COPD
patients from baseline before the PR to 1 year later. The
assessments of physical activity in daily life, pulmonary
function, submaximal exercise capacity (6MWD; six-minute
walk distance), respiratory and quadriceps muscle force,
functional status, and health-related quality of life were
done at baseline before the PR and 1 year from the baseline.
This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics
Committees of our hospital and the Akita University Grad-
uate School of Medicine, and carried out in conformity with
the Declaration of Helsinki, 2008 [14].
Intervention
PR group (pulmonary rehabilitation only)
Our PR program is a multidisciplinary home-based program.
Breathing retraining consisted of pursed-lip breathing,
diaphragmatic breathing, and slow-deep breathing, in both
the supine and sitting positions. Exercise training included
upper and lower limb exercises including COPD sitting cal-
isthenics [10], respiratory muscle stretching calisthenics
[15], level walking for at least 15 min, and inspiratory

muscle exercises using an inspiratory muscle trainer, the
Threshold (HealthScan Products, Cedar Grove, NJ) set at a
training intensity of 30%e40% of the maximal inspiratory
(PImax) muscle forces. The patients also underwent a
monthly 45-min education program including lectures about
equipment use, nutrition, stress management, relaxation
techniques, home exercises and the beneﬁts of PR. Patients
were instructed to practice this program daily at home and
were supervised by a respiratory therapist every 2 wks in
our hospital, and then we reset the intensity of exercise as
their conditions allowed.
The achievements of this home program have been re-
ported [10,16]. Indeed, the participants in the present
study were able to perform our daily program at home for
239  25 days of a year (65.4  6.8%). A nurse periodically
visited each patient at home and provided information on
the role of the PR program. The overall training intensity
was set at a dyspnea rating scale of 3, which corresponds to
approx. 50% of the maximum oxygen consumption [17].
PR D P group (pulmonary rehabilitation and feedback
from pedometer use)
The subjects in the PR þ P group completed the monitoring
using a pedometer (Kens Lifecorder EX, Nagoya, Japan;
Fig.
2)
and
received
monthly
feedback
about
their
pedometer use by PR staff for 1 year in addition to the
other aspects of the program described above for the PR
group. They attached the pedometer (which is small and
lightweight) to their belt at the waist for a period of 12 h
(from waking time until going to bed) each day for 1 year.
The pedometer contains a uniaxial accelerometer to
measure the wearer’s energy expenditure and the number
of steps every 4 s throughout each day. A proprietary al-
gorithm determines daily step counts with an intramodel
reliability of 0.998 and accuracy within 3% of the actual
number of steps taken [18]. The memory of this instrument
has a 36-day date storage capacity. When a patient comes
to our hospital for a consultation each 2 wks or monthly, we
can retrieve the date and replace the battery within a few
minutes. The patients received the feedback monthly with
their average daily PA of the previous month from the PR
staff. The patients received this feedback 11 times in the
year.
The Nakanojo study reported that 8000 steps per a day
was correlated with lower limb function [18], and thus the
COPD patients in that study were given the goal of taking
8000 steps per a day. The PR staff also gave verbal rein-
forcement to the patients to increase their PA when they
received their PA feedback. Compliance was good, as the
patients wore their pedometers for 293  49 days of a year
(80.4  13.3%).
Outcome measures
Assessment of physical activity in daily living
The assessment of physical activity in daily life was done
using a new tri-axial accelerometer system (Activity Moni-
toring and Evaluation System [A-MES], Solid Brains,
Kumamoto, Japan) [19]. The A-MES consists of two sensors
(69 H  44 W  11.5 D mm each, weight: 28 g each), a
station, and analytical software used with a personal
computer. These sensors are so small and light that they
can be attached on the thigh and the chest of the subject
wearing clothing with two pockets (Fig. 3). The physical
activity data recorded by the two sensors is sent to the A-
MES station and analyzed by the A-MES software. The A-MES
system measures the time that the wearer has spent in
several positions and moving (lying down, sitting, standing,

and walking) by using a three-dimensional analysis of ac-
celeration. The system can also measure the frequency of
postural changes: getting-up (i.e., the bodily change from a
recumbent position to an upright position) and standing-up
(i.e., the bodily change from a sitting position to an upright
position) (Fig. 4).
We informed our patients about how to use the A-MES
and conﬁrmed that each patient understood the device’s
operation. Each patient was given an A-MES, an instruction
book, and the appropriate clothing, and we instructed the
patients to measure their physical activity themselves.
Since physical activity varies according to the cycle of the
seasons [20], we measured all patient’s physical activities
before and after PR for 1 year from June 2012 until October
2013. The assessment was done for a maximum of 7
consecutive days including weekdays and weekends, and
physical activity was measured with the A-MES from waking
time until 12 h after the waking time [21]. We used the data
of the patients who provided at least two valid days of
assessment, which we considered the minimum number of
necessary days to assess reliable physical activities in daily
life [22].
Other measurements
Pulmonary function was assessed as forced vital capacity
(FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1),
FEV1/FVC, and %FEV1 measured by a spirometer (HI-701
Multi-Functional Spirometer, Chest M.I., Tokyo). The mouth
pressure was measured as respiratory muscle strength using
a respiratory dynamometer (Vitalopower KH-101, Chest
M.I.) following the method reported by the American
Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS)
recommendations [23].
For quadriceps femoris muscle force (QF), the maximum
isometric extension and contraction of this muscle were
measured at 0/sec 80 ﬂexion using the Hydro Musculator
GT-160 (OG Giken Co., Tokyo) [24]. For the measurements
of exercise performance, the patient performed a corridor
walk for 6 min according to the ATS guidelines [25]. The
patients were not encouraged during the walk. The pa-
tients’ dyspnea was assessed using
Medical Research
Council (MRC) dyspnea scale [26]. The BODE index (body-
mass index, airﬂow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise
capacity index) [27] was assessed as a prognosis factor for
COPD patients. The disease-speciﬁc health-related quality
of life (QOL) was measured using the Japanese version of
the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ) [28].
Statistical analysis
The data of the 27 patients were entered and analyzed
using SPSS (Windows) software version 21.0J for normal
distribution using parametric and non-parametric tests. P-
values <0.05 were accepted as signiﬁcant. The differences
between the two groups were compared using independent
t-tests and ManneWhitney U-tests on parametric and
nonparametric data, respectively. A Student paired t-test
or a Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed (on para-
metric and nonparametric data, respectively) to compare
these differences between pre-rehabilitation and post-
rehabilitation in both groups. Pearson’s product-moment
correlation coefﬁcient was used for single correlations be-
tween the changes of time spent in different activities
(walking, standing, sitting and lying) between pre- and
post-PR and those of other physiologic measurements, and
Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcient was used for the
ordinal scales (i.e., the MRC dyspnea scale).
Results
Forty-two patients were recruited to the present study.
Three patients refused to participate and 12 dropped out.
Therefore, 39 patients gave informed consent, and the 27
patients who completed our PR program were used for the
analyses. Details of the reasons for drop-out can be written
in Fig. 1. Twelve patients dropped out of the rehabilitation
program due to an acute exacerbation requiring long-term
hospitalization (n Z 2), death (n Z 2), and a lack of
motivation or personal reasons (n Z 8). The baseline
characteristics of the 27 COPD patients are presented in
Table 1. There were no signiﬁcant differences in baseline
characteristics between the PR and PR þ P groups.

post PR in each group
The PA results of both groups are shown in Fig. 5. There
were no signiﬁcant baseline differences between the

frequency of standing-up only in the PR þ P group. Table 2

Discussion
The GOLD guideline [1] states that physical activity is
recommended for all patients with COPD, who are apt to
reduce their physical activity in the downward spiral of
disability with COPD. Several prior studies found that the
effect of pulmonary rehabilitation for PA was obscure
[4e6,29e31], but most of these studies used high-intensity
exercise for a relatively short term; i.e., from 8 wks to 6
months [4,5,29e31]. In Japan, there are many elderly
COPD patients, and high-intensity exercise is not generally
used for them due to the risk and low patient adherence
[10]. The results of the present study show that home-
based pulmonary rehabilitation with low-intensity exer-
cise for 1 year improved domestic physical activity, and
that the PR þ P patients who received the additional
pedometer feedback, were more improved than the PR-
alone patients.
Our home-based PR program with low-intensity exercise
for 1 year also resulted in signiﬁcant improvements of
PImax, 6MWD, and CRQ scores. Pitta et al. reported that
the improvements in exercise performance, functional
status, and QOL following an increased amount of daily
physical activity are limited and that a long-lasting reha-
bilitation program was major contributing factor to the
changes in physical activity habits in everyday life [30].
Egan et al. studied the short- and long-term effects of a 7-
wk PR program on activity levels. They reported that the
program increased physical capacity, but these beneﬁts
were not sustained after 1 year, and there was no increase
in free-living activity [5]. The present study showed that
the patients’ compliance in a home exercise program was
relatively good; the patients were able to perform our daily
program at home for 239  25 days of a year (4 days a week,
in other words). We suspect that our program’s patient

education and use of low-intensity exercise contributed to
the high compliance. A long-term PR program maintaining
such continuity may lead to improvements in physical ca-
pacity and to increased physical activity at home.
In the PR þ P group, the walking time was more
improved than in the PR group after 1 year of the PR pro-
gram with the feedback from a pedometer. With a
pedometer, people become aware of their current level of
PA and have a tool to gain information and enhance their
behavior modiﬁcation efforts [12]. Blok et al. noted that
the use of a pedometer with exercise and stimulation of
lifestyle physical activity is a feasible addition to a PR
program that can improve outcomes and the maintenance
of rehabilitation results [9]. In the present study, the long-
term feedback from a pedometer as an intervention may
have enhanced the participants’ motivation to increase
their PA, resulting in the improvement of the walking time,
MRC and QF in the PR þ P group.
The reason why the PA was improved by the PR program
with the pedometer feedback can be explained by the
correlation between the degrees of improvement in PA and
physiological function in all patients (Table 4). According to
these ﬁndings, the patients’ PA was not only affected by
the improvements of physiological factors; the patients’
physiological factors were also affected by the improve-
ment of (i.e., increase in) PA. This indicates a reciprocal
inﬂuence between the physiological factors and PA, which
may lead to the improvement of psychological factors such
as health-related QOL. It is important that aging COPD
patients maintain their physiological function for daily ac-
tivity. Moreover, it may be possible to break the downward
spiral of inactivity using the additional enhancement with
the pedometer in PR.
Factors other than PR affect an individual’s PA. For
example, Swell et al. demonstrated that PA varies accord-
ing to the cycle of the seasons [20]. In the present study,
this seasonal gap was minimized to measure the patients’
PA before their PR and 1 year later. However, the patient’s
self-efﬁcacy has been reported to be a predictor as PA [31].
A limitation of the present study is that the self-efﬁcacy of
our patients was not evaluated. In addition, the design of
this present study was not blinded, which might have
concern in the result that the PA in PR þ P group were more
improved than that in PR group. As the number of the pa-
tients enrolled is very low and they were from an individual
facility, the effect of low-intensity exercise and home-
based pulmonary rehabilitation with pedometer feedback
on physical activity in elderly COPD may be worth closely
investigating through a multi-institutional joint research
involving a large number of cases in future. Further
research is needed to test the effects of increasing PA on
the prognosis of COPD patients.
Conclusions
In summary, our present ﬁndings demonstrated improve-
ments of PA in elderly patients with COPD who followed our
home-based PR program with low-intensity exercise and
feedback from a pedometer. The beneﬁcial changes in the
amount of time spent walking in the PR þ P group were
signiﬁcantly greater than that of the PR group. The
improved rate of activity after PR was signiﬁcantly corre-
lated with the improvements in physiological factors. These
data suggest that home-based PR with low-intensity exer-
cise is effective for increasing PA, and the feedback from
using a pedometer adds to this effectiveness.
