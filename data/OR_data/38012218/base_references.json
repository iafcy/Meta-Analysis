Activity levels in patients with COPD were also compared with those in healthy controls.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Consecutive patients with COPD (n = 24, aged 71.9 ± 7.7 years, forced expiratory ventilation in 1 second 44.1 ± 17.9% predicted, who completed PR) and 8 aged-matched controls (aged 66.6 ± 7.2 years) were studied. Activity was monitored with a triaxial accelerometer for 5 days before and after PR. Activity was expressed as vector magnitude units (VMU) per minute and time spent at VMU above 250 and 500, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall activity was significantly less in patients with COPD compared with that in controls (117 ± 63 compared with 242 ± 103 VMU/min, P = .0003). Time spent at VMU above 250 and 500 was also less in patients with COPD (166 ± 71 vs 227 ± 37 min, P = .028 and 39 ± 43 vs 124 ± 26 min, P < .0001, respectively). After PR, overall VMU activity was not significantly increased (117 ± 63 vs 120 ± 63 VMU/min). Time spent at VMU above 250 and 500 was also not significantly increased after PR. Increases in activity levels after PR did not correlate with improvements in exercise performance, quality of life, or quadriceps strength.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Despite significant improvements in exercise capacity and quality of life after PR, this did not translate into a significant increase in activity level.

More participants selected pressure as opposed to volume ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; 77%) than for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 50%) and postoperative ventilation (32%; P < .001). Mean tidal volume was lower for ARDS than for COPD and postoperative ventilation (5.7, 6.9, and 7.2 mL/kg, respectively; P < .001). Maximum acceptable plateau pressures were highest for ARDS (30 cm H2O vs 29 cm H2O [COPD] and 27 cm H2O [postoperative], P < .001). Initial positive expiratory end pressure (12 cm H2O vs 7 cm H2O vs 5 cm H2O) and fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2; 1.0 vs 0.5 vs 0.3) were also higher for ARDS (both P < .001); however, only 8% selected a positive expiratory end pressure/Fio2 combination as recommended by ARDSnet. Values of oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry of 97% (ARDS) and 94% (COPD and postoperative) were considered appropriate for Fio2 reduction. The lowest pH was 7.28 vs 7.23 vs 7.26; the highest pH was 7.46 vs 7.44 vs 7.46 (P < .001).

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Distance walked during the 6-min walk test (6MWT) predicts mortality in COPD. The body weight of the patient affects the work required to walk. Calculated work during the 6MWT (6MWT work) may account for differences in walk distance resulting from change in body weight. Thus, 6MWT work might be a better predictor of mortality than distance walked. This study was designed to test this hypothesis and to assess if other variables measured during the 6MWT, like continuous oximetry recording, offered additional prognostic information.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data; 104 COPD patients were studied. 6MWT was performed in all cases. 6MWT work was calculated as body weight (in kg) × distance walked (in m).

Subjects who died had more dyspnea (measured using the Borg scale) after the 6MWT (8.5 vs 4.0, P < .001), lower baseline SpO2 (85% vs 93%, P = .001), worse oxygen saturation during the 6MWT (mean SpO2 while walking 74.0% vs 86.6%, P = .02) and walked less distance (255 m vs 480 m, P = .001).

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We evaluated the efficacy of acetazolamide in preventing adverse altitude effects in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in healthy lowlanders 40 years of age or older. METHODS: Trial 1 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-design trial in which 176 patients with COPD were treated with acetazolamide capsules (375 mg/day) or placebo, starting 24 hours before staying for 2 days at 3100 m. The mean (±SD) age of participants was 57±9 years, and 34% were women. At 760 m, COPD patients had oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry of 92% or greater, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide less than 45 mm Hg, and mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 63±11% of predicted. The primary outcome in trial 1 was the incidence of the composite end point of altitude-related adverse health effects (ARAHE) at 3100 m. Criteria for ARAHE included acute mountain sickness (AMS) and symptoms or findings relevant to well-being and safety, such as severe hypoxemia, requiring intervention. Trial 2 comprised 345 healthy lowlanders. Their mean age was 53±7 years, and 69% were women. The participants in trial 2 underwent the same protocol as did the patients with COPD in trial 1. The primary outcome in trial 2 was the incidence of AMS assessed at 3100 m by the Lake Louise questionnaire score (the scale of self-assessed symptoms ranges from 0 to 15 points, indicating absent to severe, with 3 or more points including headache, indicating AMS). RESULTS: In trial 1 of patients with COPD, 68 of 90 (76%) receiving placebo and 42 of 86 (49%) receiving acetazolamide experienced ARAHE (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.79; P<0.001). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one case of ARAHE was 4 (95% CI, 3 to 8). In trial 2 of healthy individuals, 54 of 170 (32%) receiving placebo and 38 of 175 (22%) receiving acetazolamide experienced AMS (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.80; chi-square statistic P=0.035). The NNT to prevent one case of AMS was 10 (95% CI, 5 to 141). No serious adverse events occurred in these trials. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive treatment with acetazolamide reduced the incidence of adverse altitude effects requiring an intervention in patients with COPD and the incidence of AMS in healthy lowlanders 40 years of age or older during a high-altitude sojourn.

            "abstract": "The objective of the study is to assess the effects of emphysema on peak oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) during a cardiopulmonary exercise test in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We measured [Formula: see text] and oxygen pulse in 80 patients with stable COPD exercising maximally. Oxygen saturation was measured by pulse oximetry (SpO(2)), and the ventilatory response assessed by the ratio of tidal volume (V (T)) at peak to slow vital capacity (SVC) at baseline, and by the percent increase of peak V (T) over baseline. Computed tomography imaging (CT scan) served as the reference diagnostic standard for emphysema. Based on the panel-grading (PG) method, emphysema was rated absent or mild (PG ≤ 30, n = 54), or moderate to severe (PG > 30, n = 26). Multiple quantile regression was applied to estimate the effects of PG > 30 on [Formula: see text]. At peak exercise, the patients with PG > 30 had significantly lower [Formula: see text], oxygen pulse and SpO(2), and featured a blunted ventilatory response with respect to those with PG ≤ 30 (p < 0.001). With multiple quantile regression, the effects of PG > 30 on [Formula: see text] were only partially explained by the degree of lung hyperinflation, a substantial component being imputable to impairment of lung diffusing capacity. In conclusion, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with moderate to severe emphysema feature significantly lower exercise tolerance than those with no or mild emphysema. Our findings underscore the need of tailoring therapeutic interventions for COPD to the predominant clinical phenotype to improve exercise capacity."

Individual study quality was defined based on total scores according to the CONSORT Statement checklist: very low (0 to < 40%), low (≥ 40 to < 60%), moderate (≥ 60 to < 80%), and high (≥ 80 to 100%).\n    \n\n      \n      The quality of the body of evidence was assessed as high, moderate, low, or very low according to the GRADE Working Group criteria. The following definitions of quality were used in grading the quality of the evidence:\n    \n\n      \n      [Table: see text]\n    \n\n\n          Summary of Findings:\n        \n      \n      Six publications, representing 5 independent trials, met the eligibility criteria for Research Question #1. Three trials were RCTs reported across 4 publications, whereby patients were randomized to home telemonitoring or usual care, and 2 trials were CCTs, whereby patients or health care centers were nonrandomly assigned to intervention or usual care.\n    \n\n      \n      A total of 310 participants were studied across the 5 included trials. The mean age of study participants in the included trials ranged from 61.2 to 74.5 years for the intervention group and 61.1 to 74.5 years for the usual care group. The percentage of men ranged from 40% to 64% in the intervention group and 46% to 72% in the control group.\n    \n\n      \n      All 5 trials were performed in a moderate to severe COPD patient population. Three trials initiated the intervention following discharge from hospital. One trial initiated the intervention following a pulmonary rehabilitation program. The final trial initiated the intervention during management of patients at an outpatient clinic.\n    \n\n      \n      Four of the 5 trials included oxygen saturation (i.e., pulse oximetry) as one of the biological patient parameters being monitored. Additional parameters monitored included forced expiratory volume in one second, peak expiratory flow, and temperature.\n    \n\n      \n      There was considerable clinical heterogeneity between trials in study design, methods, and intervention/control. In relation to the telemonitoring intervention, 3 of the 5 included studies used an electronic health hub that performed multiple functions beyond the monitoring of biological parameters. One study used only a pulse oximeter device alone with modem capabilities. Finally, in 1 study, patients measured and then forwarded biological data to a nurse during a televideo consultation. Usual care varied considerably between studies.\n    \n\n      \n      Only one trial met the eligibility criteria for Research Question #2. The included trial was an RCT that randomized 60 patients to nurse telephone follow-up or usual care (no telephone follow-up). Participants were recruited from the medical department of an acute-care hospital in Hong Kong and began receiving follow-up after discharge from the hospital with a diagnosis of COPD (no severity restriction). The intervention itself consisted of only two 10-to 20-minute telephone calls, once between days 3 to 7 and once between days 14 to 20, involving a structured, individualized educational and supportive programme led by a nurse that focused on 3 components: assessment, management options, and evaluation.\n    \n\n      \n      Regarding Research Question #1:\n    \n\nLow to very low quality evidence (according to GRADE) finds non-significant effects or conflicting effects (of significant or non-significant benefit) for all outcomes examined when comparing home telemonitoring to usual care.There is a trend towards significant increase in time free of hospitalization and use of other health care services with home telemonitoring, but these findings need to be confirmed further in randomized trials of high quality.There is severe clinical heterogeneity between studies that limits summary conclusions.The economic impact of home telemonitoring is uncertain and requires further study.Home telemonitoring is largely dependent on local information technologies, infrastructure, and personnel, and thus the generalizability of external findings may be low. Jurisdictions wishing to replicate home telemonitoring interventions should likely test those interventions within their jurisdictional framework before adoption, or should focus on home-grown interventions that are subjected to appropriate evaluation and proven effective.\n\n\n      \n      Regarding Research Question #2:\n    \n\nLow quality evidence finds significant benefit in favour of telephone-only support for self-efficacy and emergency department visits when compared to usual care, but non-significant results for hospitalizations and hospital length of stay.There are very serious issues with the generalizability of the evidence and thus additional research is required."

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) was the most frequent diagnostic. The programs were mainly comprised of strength training exercises of lower extremity, upper extremity, walking and education. Team was constituted of physiotherapist and physician, with completed training, and directed by a physiotherapist.

            "title": "Exercise and COPD: therapeutic responses, disease-related outcomes, and activity-promotion strategies.",
            "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) reduces patients' exercise capacities and their abilities to perform daily physical activities, thereby increasing morbidity and mortality rates. The cycle of dyspnea, deconditioning, and declining physical activity not only accelerates the progression of COPD but also increases the risk for developing or aggravating metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities also limit physical function, and their disabling effects in combination with COPD may be greater than the effects of each disease alone. The impact of COPD and its treatment on the ability to exercise, and the degree of physical activity in daily life, can be measured by field-based tests (eg, the 6-minute walk test or incremental and endurance shuttle-walk test), laboratory-based tests (eg, incremental or constant work-rate treadmill and cycle-ergometer tests), and physical activity assessments (eg, questionnaires and accelerometers). Walking tests increase oxygen consumption and desaturation in patients with COPD more than cycling tests with similar work-rate profiles and may more closely resemble patients' normal activities. Despite the questionable relevance of exercise testing to patients' daily functionality, exercise parameters remain important predictors of survival in patients with COPD. Treatment of COPD (pharmacotherapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, or both) can increase exercise capacity and physical activity in daily life, which potentially slows the decline of lung function, reduces the frequencies of exacerbations and hospitalizations, decreases mortality, slows the progression of comorbidities, improves health-related quality of life, and increases the activity reserve for routine function. This article examines the interactions of reduced physical activity and decreased exercise capacity with the progression of COPD, comorbidities, and mortality. The article also describes the available exercise tests for patients with COPD and reviews the evidence indicating that treating COPD improves exercise capacity. Notably, it appears that even mild COPD reduces exercise capacity and daily physical activity, indicating the need for early intervention."

No significant differences concerning LTOT compliance were noted between men and women, urban and rural population, and between smokers, ex-smokers and non-smokers. A chest physician recommended LTOT for the majority of patients (86.3%), while COPD was the main reason for LTOT prescription (74.7%).

A variety of classifiers have been proposed in the past, but little has been done toward developing systematic approaches to assess the feasibility of discriminating the motor tasks of interest and to guide the choice of the classifier architecture.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A technique is introduced to address this problem according to a hierarchical framework and its use is demonstrated for the application of detecting motor activities in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation. Accelerometers were used to collect data for 10 different classes of activity. Features were extracted to capture essential properties of the data set and reduce the dimensionality of the problem at hand. Cluster measures were utilized to find natural groupings in the data set and then construct a hierarchy of the relationships between clusters to guide the process of merging clusters that are too similar to distinguish reliably. It provides a means to assess whether the benefits of merging for performance of a classifier outweigh the loss of resolution incurred through merging.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Analysis of the COPD data set demonstrated that motor tasks related to ambulation can be reliably discriminated from tasks performed in a seated position with the legs in motion or stationary using two features derived from one accelerometer. Classifying motor tasks within the category of activities related to ambulation requires more advanced techniques. While in certain cases all the tasks could be accurately classified, in others merging clusters associated with different motor tasks was necessary. When merging clusters, it was found that the proposed method could lead to more than 12% improvement in classifier accuracy while retaining resolution of 4 tasks.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Hierarchical clustering methods are relevant to developing classifiers of motor activities from data recorded using wearable systems.

The patient should be evaluated according to subjective response (respiratory distress, consciousness, problems related to mask and airflow), physiological responses (respiration rate, respiratory effort, air leakage) and patient-ventilator compliance (gas exchange, pulse oximetry, arterial blood gases). Normalization in respiration rate within 1 or 2 hours after initiation of treatment is one of the most important markers for recovery. The goal is to maintain respiration rate between 20 and 30 breaths/minute. Reduction in intercostal and supraclavicular retractions, paradoxical respiration and sympathetic activity indicate success of treatment. Arterial blood gases are measured within first 2 hours in order to assess pH and CO2; and as needed thereafter. In general, NIV is assessed by arterial blood gases, hemodynamic parameters and several laboratory tests. There is limited number of studies in NIV.

The remaining 85 patients were subjected to overnight pulse oximetry and end-tidal (ET)-CO2 monitoring. The nocturnal oxygen desaturation was defined as per Fletcher's criteria. The nocturnal hypoventilation was defined as per American academy of sleep medicine (AASM) guidelines. Patients having saw-tooth pattern on pulse oximetry and/or snoring were subjected to polysomnography. 38/85(44.8%) patients had nocturnal gas exchange abnormality in absence of daytime respiratory failure and were identified into 3 different phenotypes: obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), nocturnal hypoventilation and nocturnal oxygen desaturation. The isolated abnormality was seen in 24 patients: 10 patients had OSA, 9 had nocturnal hypoventilation and 5 had nocturnal oxygen desaturation. Overlap of two or more phenotypes was seen in 14 patients. As compared to the nocturnal hypoventilation and desaturation phenotypes, the OSA phenotype had a significantly higher BMI & FEV1. The nocturnal hypoventilation and the desaturation phenotypes did not have significant difference in FEV1 and BMI, but the daytime SpO2 and PaO2 differed significantly. Such parameters could help in identifying the three distinct COPD-sleep phenotypes (OSA, nocturnal hypoventilation and nocturnal oxygen desaturation).

Limited respiratory polygraphy is a four or more channel sleep study, typically with oximetry, pulse rate, air flow and chest or abdomen effort band.

However, common screening questionnaires, like Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) have not been previous evaluated in patients with overlap-coexisting COPD and OSA-syndrome versus patients with OSA alone. Our study compared ESS, FSS and HADS between patients with overlap syndrome and patients with OSA, before and after treatment with Continuous Positive Airways Pressure (CPAP). We examined 38 patients with coexisting COPD and OSA versus 38 patients with OSA-only and 28 subjects without respiratory disease, serving as controls. All patients underwent pulmonary function tests (PFTs), oximetry and overnight polysomnography and completed the questionnaires, before and after 3 months of CPAP therapy. The two patient groups did not differ significantly in terms of age, Body Mass Index (BMI), neck, waist and hip circumferences, and arterial blood pressure values. They also had similar comorbidities. They differed significantly, as expected, in PFTs (Forced Vital Capacity-FVC, 2.53±0.73 vs 3.08±0.85 lt, p = 0.005, Forced Expiratory Volume in 1sec-FEV1, 1.78±0.53 vs 2.60±0.73 lt/min, p<0.001) and in daytime oximetry (94.75±2.37 vs 96.13±1.56%, p = 0.007). ESS, HADS-Anxiety and HADS-Depression scores did not differ statistically significant between these two groups, whereas overlap syndrome patients expressed significantly more fatigue (FSS) than OSA-only patients, a finding that persisted even after 3 months of CPAP therapy. We conclude that sleepiness, anxiety and depression were similar in both groups, whereas fatigue was more prominent in patients with overlap syndrome than in sleep apneic patients and did not ameliorate after treatment."

The outcome measures were survival, clinical status, and arterial blood gas levels.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Among the 54 study patients (18 women), the mean (+/- SD) age was 56 +/- 13 years. The mean BMI was 44 +/- 8.8 kg/m2. Sleep apnea syndrome (apnea-hypopnea index, > 5) was present in 87% of the patients. At presentation, 22 of the 54 patients had experienced an acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (pH < 7.34). None of these patients required orotracheal intubation after NIPPV treatment. Initially, 2 patients were treated with volume-preset ventilation, 49 patients used pressure-preset equipment, and 3 patients employed continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Forty-seven patients required supplemental oxygen. At the end of the follow-up period (mean duration, 50 months), Pa(O2) had increased by 24 mm Hg from baseline (95% confidence interval [CI], 21 to 28 mm Hg; p < 0.0001) and Pa(CO2) had decreased by 17 mm Hg (95% CI, 13 to 20 mm Hg; p < 0.0001). NIPPV therapy improved subjective sleepiness (mean Epworth sleepiness scale score decrease, 16 +/- 5 to 6 +/- 2; p < 0.001), and dyspnea decreased in all but four patients. During follow-up, three patients died (one of them due to the progression of respiratory failure). NIPPV therapy could be withdrawn in 5 patients who had achieved a sufficient weight loss, and the conditions of 16 patients could be maintained without respiratory failure by the use of simple therapy with CPAP.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      NIPPV therapy is effective in the treatment of patients with OHS, providing a significant improvement in clinical status and gas exchange."

            "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) and exercise are interrelated but separate concepts. PA refers to bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure. Exercise is a subset of PA, in which generally higher levels of muscular activity are performed for a purpose, such as achieving physical fitness or winning a sporting contest. Higher exercise capacity is considered to be permissive of greater PA in the home and community settings. Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are physically inactive when compared with healthy age-matched control subjects. Furthermore, physical inactivity is independently associated with adverse outcome in patients with COPD, including more rapid disease progression, impaired health status, and increased health care utilization and mortality risk. While there are several methods to objectively measure PA, recent scientific studies have commonly utilized questionnaires and activity monitors. The latter include simple pedometers and complex accelerometers, which can measure and record movement in up to 3 planes. In COPD, multiple patient characteristics and disease severity markers are related to activity level, including pulmonary physiological abnormalities such as airway obstruction and hyperinflation; exercise capacity such as the 6-minute walking distance; exacerbations of respiratory disease; and comorbid conditions. Clinical trials of bronchodilators, supplemental oxygen therapy, exercise training or pulmonary rehabilitation, or PA counseling have provided inconsistent results in demonstrating increased PA from the interaction. This is probably because the phenomenon of physical inactivity is complex, resulting not only from physiological impairments, but symptoms, cultural, motivational, and environmental factors."

Previous studies have shown that anaerobic activity can clinically benefit patients hospitalized with exacerbated COPD. However, there is little information on the feasibility and safety of aerobic physical activity performed by patients with exacerbated COPD during hospitalization. Objective. To evaluate the effects of aerobic exercise on vital signs in hospitalized patients with exacerbated COPD. Patients and Methods. Eleven COPD patients (63% female, FEV1: 34.2 ± 13.9% and age: 65 ± 11 years) agreed to participate. Aerobic exercise was initiated 72 hours after admission on a treadmill; speed was obtained from the distance covered in a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Vital signs were assessed before and after exercise. Results. During the activity systolic blood pressure increased from 125.2 ± 13.6 to 135.8 ± 15.0 mmHg (p = 0.004) and respiratory rate from 20.9 ± 4.4 to 24.2 ± 4.5 rpm (p = 0.008) and pulse oximetry (SpO2) decreased from 93.8 ± 2.3 to 88.5 ± 5.7% (p < 0.001).

Daily walking activity was measured by means of accelerometry. Stepwise multivariate regression analyses were employed with either midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide (MRproANP) or plasma proadrenomedullin (MRproADM) as dependent variables, and age, age-adjusted Charlson score, Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (MMRC), Saint Georges Respiratory Questionnaire total score and either total walk, steps per day or fast walk as covariates.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Independent predictors of MRproANP included age (p = 0.015) and either total walk or steps per day (both p < 0.0001). Total walk or steps per day were the only independent predictors of MRproADM (p < 0.0001). There was a significant negative correlation between fast walk and MMRC (R = -0.70; p < 0.001) and fast walk was only independently predictive of MRproANP but not MRproADM once MMRC was excluded from the list of covariates (p = 0.023 and p = 0.057, respectively).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Daily walking activity independently predicts levels of circulating MRproANP and MRproADM in stable COPD patients, two prognostic biomarkers of cardiac distress associated with long-term survival upon exacerbation of COPD.

            "abstract": "Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival for patients afflicted with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and may also reduce the incidence of repeat hospitalization due to exacerbations. When properly dosed and titrated, LTOT has also been shown to improve exercise tolerance, thereby enhancing the overall health-related quality of life for this growing patient population. Equipment used to provide LTOT is undergoing a radical transformation, with newer delivery devices offering a sharp contrast to older, more traditional home oxygen equipment. This newer approach to providing LTOT-commonly referred to as \"non-delivery technology\"-affords LTOT users unprecedented freedom, since they are no longer dependent on home-care providers for repeat deliveries to replenish or replace depleted oxygen contents. Instead, non-delivery LTOT equipment is self-sufficient and able to provide all of the oxygen needed to meet both stationary and ambulatory requirements. However, several models of the newer LTOT equipment have certain operational and performance limitations. Accordingly, in order to preclude unintended desaturation with newer LTOT devices, each patient must undergo an individualized pulse-oximetry titration study by a knowledgeable and experienced respiratory therapist to ensure optimum dosing under all conditions of use."

Prolonged dyspnea after mask removal in the morning, often referred to as deventilation syndrome, is a common side effect but has been poorly characterized yet. This study aimed to explore the pathomechanism, identify risk factors and possible treatment strategies for the deventilation syndrome.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A prospective, controlled, non-blinded study was conducted. After a night with established NIV therapy, the patients underwent spirometry, blood gas analyses and 6-min walking tests (6MWT) directly, at 2 and 4 h after mask removal. Dyspnea was measured by the modified Borg scale. Bodyplethysmography and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires were used. Patients suffering from deventilation syndrome (defined as dyspnea of at least three points on the Borg scale after mask removal) were treated with non-invasive pursed lip breathing ventilation (PLBV) during the second night of the study.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eleven of 31 patients included (35%) met the given criteria for a deventilation syndrome. They reported significantly more dyspnea on the Borg scale directly after mask removal (mean: 7.2 ± 1.0) compared to measurement after 2 h (4.8 ± 2.6; p = 0.003). Initially, mean inspiratory vital capacity was significantly reduced (VCmax: 46 ± 16%) compared to 2 h later (54 ± 15%; p = 0.002), while no changes in pulse oximetry or blood gas analysis were observed. Patients who suffered from a deventilation syndrome had a significantly higher mean airway resistance (Reff: 320 ± 88.5%) than the patients in the control group (253 ± 147%; p = 0.021).

A relatively high screening arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SaO2) level was set, in order to maximize sensitivity. All 113 COPD out-patients attending the hospital clinic over a 6 month period were screened. Sixty had a forced expiratory volume in one second < 1.5 l and 26 had an SaO2 < or = 92%. These 26 underwent arterial blood gas analysis. Nine had an arterial oxygen tension < 7.3 kPa all with an arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) > 6 kPa. A further eight had a PaO2 < 8 kPa. This produced a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 69% for oximetry in the detection of PaO2 < 7.3 kPa determined by direct arterial puncture and 100% and 86% respectively for detecting a PaO2 < 8 kPa.

As this phenotype may be explained by the sedentary lifestyle that commonly accompanies this disease, the aim of this study was to determine whether such alterations are still evident when patients with COPD are compared to control subjects matched for objectively measured physical activity (PA; accelerometry). Indexes of mitochondrial density [citrate synthase (CS) activity], respiratory function (respirometry in permeabilized fibers), and muscle oxidative stress [4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) content] were assessed in muscle fibers biopsied from the vastus lateralis of nine patients with COPD and nine PA-matched control subjects (CON). Despite performing similar levels of PA (CON: 18 ± 3, COPD: 20 ± 7 daily minutes moderate-to-vigorous PA; CON: 4,596 ± 683, COPD: 4,219 ± 763 steps per day, P > 0.70), patients with COPD still exhibited several alterations in their mitochondrial phenotype, including attenuated skeletal muscle mitochondrial density (CS activity; CON 70.6 ± 3.8, COPD 52.7 ± 6.5 U/mg, P < 0.05), altered mitochondrial respiration [e.g., ratio of complex I-driven state 3 to complex II-driven state 3 (CI/CII); CON: 1.20 ± 0.11, COPD: 0.90 ± 0.05, P < 0.05), and oxidative stress (4-HNE; CON: 1.35 ± 0.19, COPD: 2.26 ± 0.25 relative to β-actin, P < 0.05). Furthermore, CS activity ( r = 0.55), CI/CII ( r = 0.60), and 4-HNE ( r = 0.49) were all correlated with pulmonary function, assessed as forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( P < 0.05), but not PA ( P > 0.05). In conclusion, the altered mitochondrial phenotype in COPD is present even in the absence of differing levels of PA and appears to be related to the disease itself. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with debilitating alterations in the function of skeletal muscle mitochondria. By comparing the mitochondrial phenotype of patients with COPD to that of healthy control subjects who perform the same amount of physical activity each day, this study provides evidence that many aspects of the dysfunctional mitochondrial phenotype observed in COPD are not merely due to reduced physical activity but are likely related to the disease itself."

The following day, patients travelled to HA (3100 m) for two overnight stays where ARAHE development including acute mountain sickness (AMS), Lake Louise Score ≥4 and/or AMS score ≥0.7, severe hypoxaemia (S pO2 <80% for >30 min or 75% for >15 min) or intercurrent illness was observed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      ARAHE occurred in 50 (66%) patients and 23 out of 75 (31%) were positive on HAST according to S pO2 , and 11 out of 64 (17%) according to P aO2 . For S pO2 /P aO2 we report a sensitivity of 46/25%, specificity of 84/95%, positive predictive value of 85/92% and negative predictive value of 44/37%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In COPD patients ascending to HA, ARAHE are common. Despite an acceptable positive predictive value of the HAST to predict ARAHE, its clinical use is limited by its insufficient sensitivity and overall accuracy. Counselling COPD patients before altitude travel remains challenging and best focuses on early recognition and treatment of ARAHE with oxygen and descent."

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) increases physical capacity in COPD, but the impact on SPI is unknown. In this study, we aimed at elucidating the prevalence of SPI in COPD patients attending standard PR, the impact of PR on SPI prevalence, and the relationship between SPI and time spent in moderate physical activity thus whether American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommendations are clinically useful in excluding SPI in COPD.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This is a prospective non-interventional pilot study on patients with COPD completing PR, consenting to wear an accelerometer (Sensewear© Armband) for a week before and after completing PR to assess changes in energy expenditure, time spent in physical activity, and number of daily steps.

Surprisingly, 31 of SPI patients (97%) spent ≥150 minutes/week in moderate physical activity. After rehabilitation, 24 (78%) did not change activity level and were persistently SPI.

Wearable technology, such as pedometer or accelerometer, may offer an opportunity to quantify physical activity and evaluate related health benefits in these patients. Objectives: To assess the performance of wearable technology in monitoring and improving physical activity in COPD patients from published studies. Methods: Literature search of Medline, Cochrane, Dare, Embase and PubMed databases was made to find relevant articles that used wearable technology to monitor physical activity in COPD patients. Results: We identified 13 studies that used wearable technology, a pedometer or an accelerator, to monitor physical activity in COPD patients. Of these, six studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which used the monitors as part of the intervention. Two studies reported the same outcomes and comparable units. They had measured the difference that the intervention makes on the number of steps taken daily by the patients. The results were highly heterogeneous with I2=92%. The random-effects model gave an effect outcome on the number of steps taken daily of 1,821.01 [-282.71; 3,924.74] in favor of the wearable technology. Four of the 13 studies have reported technical issues with the use of the wearable technology, including high signal-to-noise ratio, memory storage problems and inaccuracy of counts. While other studies did not mention any technical issues, it is not clear whether these did not experience them or chose not to report them. Conclusions: Our literature search has shown that data on the use of wearable technology to monitor physical activity in COPD patients are limited by the small number of studies and their heterogeneous study design. Further research and better-designed RCTs are needed to provide reliable results before physical activity monitors can be implemented routinely for COPD patients."

We developed a telemonitoring system based on a digital health platform that was used to collect data from the 1-year EDGE (Self Management and Support Programme) COPD clinical trial aiming at daily monitoring in a heterogeneous group of patients with moderate to severe COPD.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objectives of the study were as follows: first, to develop a systematic and reproducible approach to exacerbation identification and to track the progression of patient condition during remote monitoring; and second, to develop a robust algorithm able to predict COPD exacerbation, based on vital signs acquired from a pulse oximeter.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We used data from 110 patients, with a combined monitoring period of more than 35,000 days. We propose a finite-state machine-based approach for modeling COPD exacerbation to gain a deeper insight into COPD patient condition during home monitoring to take account of the time course of symptoms. A robust algorithm based on short-period trend analysis and logistic regression using vital signs derived from a pulse oximeter is also developed to predict exacerbations.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      On the basis of 27,260 sessions recorded during the clinical trial (average usage of 5.3 times per week for 12 months), there were 361 exacerbation events. There was considerable variation in the length of exacerbation events, with a mean length of 8.8 days. The mean value of oxygen saturation was lower, and both the pulse rate and respiratory rate were higher before an impending exacerbation episode, compared with stable periods. On the basis of the classifier developed in this work, prediction of COPD exacerbation episodes with 60%-80% sensitivity will result in 68%-36% specificity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      All 3 vital signs acquired from a pulse oximeter (pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate) are predictive of COPD exacerbation events, with oxygen saturation being the most predictive, followed by respiratory rate and pulse rate. Combination of these vital signs with a robust algorithm based on machine learning leads to further improvement in positive predictive accuracy.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN): 40367841; http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN40367841 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6olpMWNpc)."

            "abstract": "Continuous electrocardiograms were recorded from ten patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. During 24 hours of recording, the patients breathed air; and for 24 hours, they breathed oxygen at 2 L/min by nasal cannula. Oxygenation, as monitored by ear oximetric studies and by periodic analysis of arterial blood, showed frequent nocturnal desaturation. Nine patients demonstrated arrhythmias during the monitoring period, and the frequency of premature ventricular contractions was significantly greater at night. Therapy with supplemental oxygen dramatically reduced the frequency of premature ventricular contractions in four patients, but the reduction in frequency of arrhythmias in the total group did not reach statistical significance. These results show that cardiac arrhythmias occur commonly at night during sleep in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The data suggest that arterial desaturation may be responsible for some of these arrhythmias."

However, individual and structural barriers lead to a staggering amount of people with COPD that are not offered support for such strategies, and new approaches are urgently needed to circumvent these barriers. A promising way of delivering health services such as support for self-management strategies is the use of eHealth tools. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the usage of, and factors affecting the use of, eHealth tools over time in people with COPD.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed, among people with COPD, to explore and describe the experiences of an eHealth tool over time and factors that might affect usage.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The eHealth tool included information on evidence-based self-management treatment for people with COPD, including texts, pictures, videos as well as interactive components such as a step registration function with automatized feedback. In addition to the latter, automated notifications of new content and pedometers were used as triggers to increase usage. After having access to the tool for 3 months, 16 individuals (12 women) with COPD were individually interviewed. At 12 months' access to the tool, 7 (5 women) of the previous 16 individuals accepted a second individual interview. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.

Nonusers/seldom users (median 1.5 logins and 1.78 minutes spent on the site per month) reported low motivation, a higher need for technical support, a negative view about the disease and self-management, and had problematic health literacy as measured by the Communicative and Critical Health Literacy Scale (median [range] 154 [5-2102]). Users (median 10 logins and 43 minutes per month) felt comfortable with information technology (IT) tools, had a positive view on triggers, and had sufficient health literacy (median [range] 5 [5-1400]). Benefits including behavior changes were mainly expressed after 12 months had passed and mainly among users.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Findings of this study indicate that the level of motivation, comfortability with IT tools, and the level of health literacy seem to affect usage of an eHealth tool over time. Besides, regarding behavioral changes, gaining benefits from the eHealth tool seems reserved for the users and specifically after 12 months, thus suggesting that eHealth tools can be suitable media for supporting COPD-specific self-management skills, although not for everyone or at all times. These novel findings are of importance when designing new eHealth tools as well as when deciding on whether or not an eHealth tool might be appropriate to use if the goal is to support self-management among people with COPD.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02696187; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02696187.\n    \n\n\n          International registered report identifier (irrid):\n        \n      \n      RR2-10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016851."

The secondary endpoints were physiological parameters, duration of ventilation, duration of ICU and hospital stay, 6-month recurrence, and rehospitalization rates. The trial was stopped prematurely (445 randomized patients) because of a low global failure rate (NIV failure: air/O2 14.5% [n = 32]; heliox 14.7% [n = 33]; P = 0.97, and time to NIV failure: heliox group 93 hours [n = 33], air/O2 group 52 hours [n = 32]; P = 0.12). Respiratory rate, pH, PaCO2, and encephalopathy score improved significantly faster with heliox. ICU stay was comparable between the groups. In patients intubated after NIV failed, patients on heliox had a shorter ventilation duration (7.4 ± 7.6 d vs. 13.6 ± 12.6 d; P = 0.02) and a shorter ICU stay (15.8 ± 10.9 d vs. 26.7 ± 21.0 d; P = 0.01).

            "abstract": "Elderly people, with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), may be susceptible to particulate matter (PM) air pollution. However, the respiratory impacts of inhaled PM combined with copollutant(s) in controlled exposure studies are unclear and warrant investigation since exposures to PMgas mixtures constitute realistic scenarios. Thus, we exposed 6 healthy subjects and 18 volunteers with COPD (mean age 71 yr) on separate days to (a) filtered air (FA); (b) 0.4 ppm NO2; (c) concentrated ambient particles (CAP), predominantly in the fine (PM2.5) size range, at concentrations near 200 microg/m3; and (d) CAP and NO2 together. Each 2-h exposure included exercise for 15 min every half hour. Most respiratory responses, including symptoms, spirometry, and total and differential counts of induced sputum cells, showed no statistically significant responses attributable to separate or combined effects of CAP and NO2. However, maximal mid-expiratory flow and arterial O2 saturation (measured by pulse oximetry) showed small but statistically significant decrements associated with CAP, greater in healthy than COPD subjects. CAP exposure was also associated with decreased percentages of columnar epithelial cells in sputum. The results suggest that the respiratory effect of the PMNO2 mixture may be primarily PM driven since coexposure to NO2 did not significantly enhance the responses. In conclusion, older adults exposed to urban fine particles may experience acute small-airways dysfunction with impaired gas exchange. Healthy subjects appear more susceptible, suggesting that the respiratory effect may be related to efficient penetration and deposition of inhaled toxic particles in distal small airways. More clinical investigation of the elderly population is warranted."

A 4 s step filter in the Omron screens out erroneous intermittent steps; it captures continuous walking that lasts >4 s. The SAM captures all intermittent and continuous steps walked. Omron-steps were compared with manually counted steps in the clinic and with SAM-steps in the community. We calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient for the first 2 d, the first 3 d, etc., up to 14 d.

To explore this relationship further, we compared physical activity of COPD patients assessed in 2008 to subsequent hospitalizations and mortality. Sixty adults with a history of cigarette smoking, a diagnosis of COPD, a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) of <0.70, and no recent exacerbation were studied. Physical activity was measured using a triaxial accelerometerworn on the waist for seven consecutive days and the vector magnitude units (VMUs) that are the sum of movements in three planes over each minute were recorded. Those patients with mean VMU<170 (the median) were considered to be less physically active, and those with a 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) test of <350 m were considered to have lower functional exercise capacity. These two variables, along with age, gender, and a history of exacerbations in the preceding 12 months, FEV1, body mass index, and supplemental oxygen requirement, were related to subsequent all-cause and respiratory-related hospitalizations that occurred over the ensuing 53±2 months. The mean age was 68±11 years, 50% were male, and the FEV1 was 53±19%. All-cause and respiratory-related hospitalizations occurred in 58 and 35%, respectively. A 6MWD<350 m and VMU<170 each significantly predicted subsequent all-cause and respiratory-related hospitalizations in univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses after controlling for previous exacerbations. Both 6MWD<350 m and VMU<170 counts remained in a multivariate model predicting respiratory-related hospitalization. These results indicate that both directly measured physical activity and functional exercise capacity are important predictors of hospitalization in COPD."

            "abstract": "Patients with COPD may show slow, progressive deteriorations in arterial blood gases during the night, particularly during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This is mainly due to hypoventilation, while a deterioration of ventilation/perfusion mismatch plays a minor role. The severity of gas exchanges alterations is proportional to the degree of impairment of diurnal pulmonary function tests, particularly of partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) in arterial blood, but correlations between diurnal and nocturnal blood gas levels are rather loose. Subjects with diurnal PaO2 of 60-70 mmHg are distinguished in \"desaturators\" and \"nondesaturators\" according to nocturnal oxyhemoglobin saturation behavior. The role of nocturnal hypoxemia as a determinant of alterations in sleep structure observed in COPD is dubious. Effects of the \"desaturator\" condition on pulmonary hemodynamics, evolution of diurnal blood gases, and life expectancy are also controversial. Conversely, it is generally accepted that occurrence of sleep apneas in COPD is associated with a worse evolution of the disease. Nocturnal polysomnographic monitoring in COPD is usually performed when coexistence of sleep apnea (\"overlap syndrome\") is suspected, while in most other cases nocturnal oximetry may be enough. Nocturnal oxygen attenuates sleep desaturations among stable patients, without increases in PaCO2 of clinical concern. Nocturnal treatment with positive pressure ventilators may give benefit to some stable hypercapnic subjects and patients with the overlap syndrome."

Lowlanders with COPD [Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades 1-2, oxygen saturation assessed by pulse oximetry (SpO2) >92%] were randomized to dexamethasone (4 mg bid) or placebo starting 24 h before ascent from 760 m and while staying at 3,100 m for 48 h. Saline-contrast echocardiography was performed at 760 m and after the first night at altitude. Of 87 patients (81 men, 6 women; mean ± SD age 57 ± 9 yr, forced expiratory volume in 1 s 89 ± 22% pred, SpO2 95 ± 2%), 39 were assigned to placebo and 48 to dexamethasone.

Eleven patients receiving placebo and 13 receiving dexamethasone developed new RLS at altitude (P = 0.011 for both changes, P = 0.411 between groups). RLS prevalence at 3,100 m was 30 (77%) in the placebo and 36 (75%) in the dexamethasone group (P = not significant). Development of RLS at altitude could be predicted at lowland by a higher resting pulmonary artery pressure, a lower arterial partial pressure of oxygen, and a greater oxygen desaturation during exercise but not by treatment allocation. Almost half of lowlanders with COPD revealed RLS near sea level, and this proportion significantly increased to about three-fourths when traveling to 3,100 m irrespective of dexamethasone prophylaxis.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The prevalence of intracardiac and intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts (RLS) at altitude in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has not been studied so far. In a large cohort of patients with moderate COPD, our randomized trial showed that the prevalence of RLS increased from 48% at 760 m to 75% at 3,100 m in patients taking placebo. Preventive treatment with dexamethasone did not significantly reduce the altitude-induced recruitment of RLS. Development of RLS at 3,100 m could be predicted at 760 m by a higher resting pulmonary artery pressure and arterial partial pressure of oxygen and a more pronounced oxygen desaturation during exercise.

On two consecutive days, patients received, in a randomized order, formoterol 12microg via Turbuhaler plus placebo via Diskus or salmeterol 50microg via Diskus plus placebo via Turbuhaler. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography measurements of sPAP were made before and 15, 30, 60 and 180min after bronchodilator inhalation. Lung function, pulse oximetry and heart rate were also monitored at the same times. Mean sPAP significantly (p<0.05) decreased in comparison with baseline at 15, 30, and 60min post inhalation but returned towards control levels at 180min after both salmeterol and formoterol. There was no correlation between the maximum increase in FEV(1) and maximum decrease in sPAP either after inhalation of salmeterol (r(2)=0.071) or after that of formoterol (r(2)=0.0006). The increases in FEV(1) in comparison with baseline were always significant (p<0.05) from 15 to 180min post inhalation after either salmeterol or formoterol. Neither pulse oximetry nor heart rate changed in a significant manner (p>0.05). This study demonstrated that salmeterol and formoterol were equally beneficial for pulmonary haemodynamics in patients with COPD. A direct vasodilatation due to the activation of beta-adrenoceptors that are present in pulmonary vessels is a likely mechanism of their action in inducing the decrease in sPAP."

Patients with COPD often suffer from exertional dyspnea and adopt a sedentary lifestyle, which could be associated with poorer HRQOL. The aim of this study was to investigate the independent association of objectively measured daily physical activity and functional capacity with HRQOL in patients with COPD.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this cross-sectional study conducted at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, 87 stable patients (58.6% male, mean age: 67.3 ± 9.6 yrs) with COPD in GOLD grades I (n = 23), II (n = 46), III (n = 12) and IV (n = 6) were investigated. To assess HRQOL, the COPD assessment test (CAT) was completed. Patients performed spirometry and 6-min walk test. Physical activity was measured by the SenseWear Mini Armband on 7 consecutive days.

The purpose of this study was to examine the PA trajectories of patients with COPD during and after PR and whether demographic, clinical, or program characteristics differed across these trajectories. The study was approved by Research Ethics Boards at all participating institutions, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to study inclusion. COPD patients (N = 190) completed a questionnaire and wore a pedometer for 7 days at baseline, end of PR, and 3 and 9 months after completing PR. Latent class growth analyses showed that two distinct PA trajectories emerged. Active Maintainers averaged 9177 steps/day at baseline, and maintained this level throughout the assessment and post rehabilitation period. In contrast, Inactive Maintainers averaged 3133 steps/day at baseline, which also remained stable during and after PR. Follow-up analyses showed the Inactive Maintainers were more likely to be retired from work and have lower baseline scores for their stress tests and 6-minute walk tests compared to Active Maintainers (all p < 0.05). These results suggest that two distinct steps/day trajectories exist for COPD patients during and after completing PR that are partially explained by specific demographic and clinical characteristics."

            "abstract": "Acute severe asthma, formerly known as status asthmaticus, is defined as severe asthma unresponsive to repeated courses of beta-agonist therapy. It is a medical emergency that requires immediate recognition and treatment. Albuterol in combination with ipratropium bromide in the emergency department (ED) has been shown to decrease the time spent in the ED and the hospitalization rates. The benefits of ipratropium are not sustained after admission to the hospital. Oral or parenteral corticosteroids should be administered to all patients with acute severe asthma as early as possible because clinical benefits may not occur for a minimum of 6 to 12 hours. Viral respiratory infections are a common trigger for acute asthma; other causes include medical nonadherence, allergen exposure (especially pets and mold [e.g., Alternaria species]) in individuals who are severely atopic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory exposure in patients with aspirin allergy, irritant inhalation (e.g., smoke, paint), exercise, and insufficient use of inhaled or oral corticosteroids. The patient's history should focus on the acute assessment of asthma control and morbidity, including current use of oral or inhaled corticosteroids; the number of hospitalizations, ED visits, intensive care unit admissions, and intubations; the frequency of albuterol use; the presence of nighttime symptoms; activity intolerance; current medications; exposure to allergens; and other significant medical conditions. Severe airflow obstruction may be predicted by accessory muscle use, difficulty speaking, refusal to recline < 30°, a pulse of >120 beats/min, and decreased breath sounds. More objective measures of airway obstruction via peak flow or forced expiratory volume in 1 second and pulse oximetry before oxygen administration usually are helpful. Pulse oximetry values of >90% are reassuring, although CO₂ retention and a low partial pressure of oxygen may be missed."

After the screening period, participants were randomised into the Kaia COPD app group (intervention group (IG)) or the control group (CG). The primary outcome was PA (daily steps), measured using an activity tracker. Secondary outcomes included the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ) and the 1 min Sit-to-Stand Test (STST).\n## RESULTS\nSixty participants completed the study. The median steps from baseline to 6 months were significantly different between the groups, in favour of the IG (-105.3, IQR -1970.1 to 2105.8, vs CG -1173.0, IQR -3813.1 to -93.8; p=0.007).

Moreover, focus was set on potential differences with regard to baseline exercise performance, age and sex. Main findings of this review emphasize the close association between individual SpO2 and VO2max, and demonstrate similar altitude effects (acute and during acclimatization) in healthy people and those suffering from cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.

No significant correlation between Borg changes and FEV1 decline was found. Patients with advanced COPD presented significantly greater Borg and oxygen saturation changes than patients with less severe disease (p = 0.02 and p = 0.001, respectively).

Pulse oximetry readings (oxygen saturation [Spo2]) are monitored, and supplemental oxygen is added in 2 L/min increments to keep Spo2 > 88%. This continues for at least 6 min of walking with the Spo2 remaining > 88% for at least 3 min.

These factors should be held constant when the test is repeated.The 6MWT, ISWT and ESWT are strenuous tests, with cardiorespiratory responses that are similar to those during a maximal incremental exercise test.

The Technical Standard shows that all three tests are valid and reliable measures of functional exercise capacity in people with chronic respiratory disease and makes recommendations for standardising their performance. Key findings and recommendations of the Technical Standard include: The 6MWT, ISWT and ESWT are strenuous tests which elicit cardiorespiratory responses that are similar to those observed during a maximal incremental exercise test. As a result, the contraindications and precautions for field walking tests should be consistent with those used for a laboratory-based incremental exercise test.There is strong evidence of a learning effect for the 6MWT and ISWT. Two tests should be performed when the 6MWT or ISWT are used to measure change over time.The 6MWT, ISWT and ESWT are responsive to treatment effects in people with chronic respiratory disease, particularly for rehabilitation.The 6MWT is very sensitive to variations in methodology, including use of encouragement, provision of supplemental oxygen, changes in track layout and length, and use of wheeled walkers. These factors should be documented and held constant on repeat testing.The lowest S pO2 recorded during a 6MWT is an important marker of disease severity and prognosis. Continuous pulse oximetry is recommended during the 6MWT, to ensure that the lowest S pO2 is recorded.In adults with chronic respiratory disease, a change in 6-min walk distance of 30 m or more indicates a clinically significant change has occurred."

In long-term, spirometry values increased and decreased without notable changes in symptoms as reported by CAT, although it was unusual with a decrease of more than 50 mL per measurement of FEV1 between three consecutive measurement days. No exacerbation occurred. There was a moderate to strong positive correlation between FEV1 and IC, but weak or absent correlation with the other prognostic markers in the majority of the participants.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although FEV1 and IC varied within a noticeable range, no corresponding change in symptoms occurred. Therefore, this study reveals important and, to our knowledge, previously not reported information about short and long-term variability in prognostic markers in stable patients with COPD. The present data are of significance when defining criteria for detecting exacerbations using telehealth strategies."

Pulsing demand oxygen delivery systems (DODS) can adequately oxygenate most patients at rest and usually during exercise. However, some patients desaturate during exercise at DODS settings equivalent to continuous-flow oxygen.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      Determine if design enhancements of the Oxymatic 401 DODS (including increased sensitivity, earlier inspiratory delivery, larger pulse volume, modified pulse contour, and higher settings) better maintain blood oxygen saturation (measured via pulse oximetry [S(pO2)]) in patients who severely desaturate during exercise.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We compared patients receiving DODS oxygen and patients receiving continuous-flow oxygen, during both rest and iso-exercise.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      This study was conducted in the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program at Mission Hospital, Regional Medical Center, Mission Viejo, California.\n    \n\n\n          Subjects:\n        \n      \n      We studied 10 patients with chronic lung disease and difficulty maintaining exercise S(pO2) with DODS. Nine patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and one had restrictive lung disease. The group's (mean +/- SD) demographic and physiologic values included: age 67 +/- 7 y, forced expiratory volume in the first second 0.79 +/- 0.3 L, forced vital capacity 1.7 +/- 0.7 L, and S(pO2) 88%.\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      Resting S(pO2) was measured during continuous oxygen flow and during DODS, at identical settings. S(pO2) was allowed to stabilize at each level before recording. During treadmill exercise at identical work loads we measured continuous flow and DODS S(pO2) at the same settings. If the DODS S(pO2) was less than during the equivalent continuous flow, the DODS setting was increased for another treadmill trial.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At rest the DODS was equivalent to continuous flow: S(pO2) was 93.7 +/- 2.1% with DODS and 93.8 +/- 1.9% with continuous flow. During exercise at corresponding settings DODS S(pO2) was 90.5 +/- 3.8% and continuous-flow S(pO2) was 93.1 +/- 3.1%. Six subjects had S(pO2) > 90%, with 4 of them achieving equivalency. At higher DODS settings S(pO2) became equivalent: 92.5 +/- 2.8%.

            "abstract": "Healthcare access and delivery for individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who live in remote areas or who are susceptible to contracting communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, may be a challenge. Telehealth and remote monitoring devices can be used to overcome this issue. However, the accuracy of these devices must be ensured before forming healthcare decisions based on their outcomes. Therefore, a systematic review was performed to synthesize the evidence on the reliability, validity and responsiveness of digital devices used for tracking oxygen saturation (SpO2) and/or respiratory rate (RR) in individuals with COPD, in remote settings. Three electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE (1996 to October 8, 2020), EMBASE (1996 to October 8, 2020) and CINAHL (1998 to October 8, 2020). Studies were included if they aimed to evaluate one or more measurement properties of a digital device measuring SpO2 or RR in individuals with COPD. Six-hundred and twenty-five articles were identified and after screening, 7 studies matched the inclusion criteria; covering 11 devices measuring SpO2 and/or RR. Studies reported on the reliability (n = 1), convergent validity (n = 1), concurrent validity (n = 2) and predictive validity (n = 2) of SpO2 devices and on the convergent validity (n = 1), concurrent validity (n = 1) and predictive validity (n = 1) of RR devices. SpO2 and RR devices were valid when compared against other respiration monitoring devices but were not precise in predicting exacerbation events. More well-designed measurement studies are needed to make firm conclusions about the accuracy of such devices.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2021.1945021 ."

            "abstract": "Home noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is used in COPD patients with concomitant chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure in order to correct nocturnal hypoventilation and improve sleep quality, quality of life, and survival. Monitoring of home NIV is needed to assess the effectiveness of ventilation and adherence to therapy, resolve potential adverse effects, reinforce patient knowledge, provide maintenance of the equipment, and readjust the ventilator settings according to the changing condition of the patient. Clinical monitoring is very informative. Anamnesis focuses on the improvement of nocturnal hypoventilation symptoms, sleep quality, and side effects of NIV. Side effects are major cause of intolerance. Screening side effects leads to modification of interface, gas humidification, or ventilator settings. Home care providers maintain ventilator and interface and educate patients for correct use. However, patient's education should be supervised by specialized clinicians. Blood gas measurement shows a significant decrease in PaCO2 when NIV is efficient. Analysis of ventilator data is very useful to assess daily use, unintentional leaks, upper airway obstruction, and patient ventilator synchrony. Nocturnal oximetry and capnography are additional monitoring tools to assess the impact of NIV on gas exchanges. In the near future, telemonitoring will reinforce and change the organization of home NIV for COPD patients."

            "abstract": "Exercise capacity and physical activity are different concepts: the former refers to what an individual is capable of performing, while the latter refers to what the individual does in daily life. Low levels of physical activity (PA), which are very common in individuals with COPD, are associated with poor health outcomes, including increased symptoms, a more rapid decline in lung function, increased health care utilization and increased mortality risk. Because of these pervasive negative outcomes, attempts have been made to increase physical activity in individuals with COPD, hoping that success in this area will mitigate the negative effects of inactivity. Based on its ability to increase exercise capacity and reduce dyspnea in COPD and other chronic respiratory diseases, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) would be expected also increase physical activity in these patients. However, accessibility to pulmonary rehabilitation programs is problematic in some areas, and studies testing its effectiveness in this outcome area have had inconsistent results. Using telehealth interventions using technology to provide medical care conveniently over a distance would have the benefit of reaching a larger proportion of individuals with COPD. A systematic review of clinical trials testing telehealth to promote physical activity had mixed results and low-certainty evidence, resulting in the inability to recommend any single type of intervention. Thus, using telehealth interventions to promote physical activity for individuals with chronic respiratory diseases, while promising, remains an area where future investigations are needed to identify its optimal modalities and clarify its benefits."

            "abstract": "Epidemiologic data suggest that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) might be more sensitive than normal persons to the respiratory effects of oxidant pollutant exposure. Our study was designed to determine the response of patients with COPD to ozone. Thirteen white men with nonreversible airways obstruction (mean FEV1/FVC, 58%), of whom 8 were current smokers, were randomly exposed for 2 h to air and to 0.2 ppm ozone on 2 consecutive days using a single-blind crossover design. During either exposure, subjects exercised for 7.5 min every 30 min. Measures of respiratory mechanics obtained pre-exposure and postexposure were not significantly affected by either exposure. Similarly, ventilation and gas exchange measured during exercise showed no difference either between exercise periods or exposure days. However, arterial O2 saturation (SaO2), measured by ear oximetry during the final exercise period each day was lower (94.8%) at the end of O2 exposure, than SaO2 obtained at the end of air exposure (95.3%), the difference (0.48%) being significant (p = 0.008). Because normal subjects undergoing comparable exposures show a threshold for respiratory mechanical effects at about 0.3 ppm ozone, our data suggest that mild to moderate COPD is not associated with increased sensitivity to low ozone concentrations. However, our data do not rule out the possibility that the response of such subjects might be exaggerated at higher ozone concentrations. The consistent (in 11 of 13 subjects), though small, decrease in SaO2 may indicate that indexes of ventilation/perfusion distribution might be more sensitive measures of ozone effect in this compromised patient group than are conventional respiratory mechanics measures."

            "abstract": "We investigated the occurrence of nocturnal respiratory disorders during air and supplemental oxygen breathing in 16 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) undergoing long-term home oxygen therapy (LTOT). Following a first night of acclimatization, non-attended continuous nocturnal monitoring was performed for two successive nights in a randomized order. During one night patients breathed room air (\"Air night\"), and during the other they underwent LTOT (\"O2 night\") at the same protective O2 nasal flow rate set during waking hours in a resting state. O2 was administered from liquid reservoirs. On both occasions, the patients were monitored during the night for oxygen saturation by pulse finger oximetry (Sp,O2), chest-abdomen impedance, mouth-nasal thermistor flow rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), body position, eye movements, and leg movements. During the O2 night, compared to the Air night, mean (+/- SD) desaturation time decreased from 46 +/- 29 to 13 +/- 25%, while obstructive apnoea-hypopnoea duration increased from 6 +/- 8 to 9 +/- 7%, both expressed as percentage of total sleep time. The sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (SAHS) rate during the Air-night was 2 out of 16, both SAHS patients showing a reduction of apnoea-hypopnoea number.h-1 during the O2 night; whilst SAHS was noted in a further two patients during the O2 night. We conclude that Sp,O2 together with monitoring of breathing during the night, is potentially useful in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergoing long-term oxygen therapy, not only when evaluating the O2 flow rate to be used during the night, but also for an understanding of the pathogenesis of nocturnal arterial oxyhaemoglobin desaturations, which may or may not be related to respiratory events."

Treatment should be individualised and \"pneumatic stenting\" with the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may lead to symptomatic relief, and in some cases regardless of the degree of collapse or absence of sleep disordered breathing in overnight oximetry. The case of a 63-year-old female referred to a tertiary respiratory department for a trial of CPAP due to EDAC is presented. Over the course of a few months, she had presented frequently to hospital with cough and shortness of breath which had been attributed to asthma. As she had not responded to treatment, an inpatient flexible bronchoscopy was performed which identified EDAC of the right main bronchus and she was referred to a tertiary ventilation department. Despite a normal sleep study whilst self-ventilating, nocturnal CPAP therapy significantly improved quality and duration of sleep, daytime symptoms and therefore quality of life.

Pulmonary mechanical function was evaluated before exposure, after initial exercise, and at the end of exposure. Blood oxygenation was measured by ear oximetry before exposure and during the second exercise period. Symptoms were recorded throughout exposure periods and for 1 week afterward. No statistically significant changes in physiology or symptoms could be attributed to SO2 exposure. Older adults with COPD seem less reactive to a given concentration of SO2 than heavily exercising young adult asthmatics.

Patients with an oxygen saturation of less than 90% for at least 30% of the recording time on nocturnal oximetry were assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either nocturnal oxygen or ambient air from a sham concentrator (placebo).

            "abstract": "Hypoxemia, a medical condition that occurs when the blood is not carrying enough oxygen to adequately supply the tissues, is a leading indicator for dangerous complications of respiratory diseases like asthma, COPD, and COVID-19. While purpose-built pulse oximeters can provide accurate blood-oxygen saturation (SpO2) readings that allow for diagnosis of hypoxemia, enabling this capability in unmodified smartphone cameras via a software update could give more people access to important information about their health. Towards this goal, we performed the first clinical development validation on a smartphone camera-based SpO2 sensing system using a varied fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) protocol, creating a clinically relevant validation dataset for solely smartphone-based contact PPG methods on a wider range of SpO2 values (70-100%) than prior studies (85-100%). We built a deep learning model using this data to demonstrate an overall MAE = 5.00% SpO2 while identifying positive cases of low SpO2 < 90% with 81% sensitivity and 79% specificity. We also provide the data in open-source format, so that others may build on this work."

Modern portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) have been shown as effective as other oxygen delivery devices in many circumstances. However, there are concerns that they are not effective during sleep when the breathing is shallow, and at very high respiratory rates as during physical exertion. It can be challenging to examine the determinants of POC efficacy clinically due to the heterogeneity of lung function within oxygen users, the diversity of user behaviour, and measurement issues. Representative bench testing may help identify key determinants of pulsed-oxygen device efficacy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Three contemporary devices were bench-evaluated across three simulated breathing behaviours: activity, rest, & oronasal breathing during sleep.

The Bland-Altman plot showed a median difference of 3 steps (5th and 95th quintiles, -8.0 and 145.0, respectively). We calculated percent difference = ([manual - Omron step counts]/manual step counts) x 100. Variability in percent difference occurred at the lowest usual walking speeds. At speeds <or= 0.94 m/s, the mean +/- standard deviation percent difference was 14 +/- 26%.

Second, we examined step counts in 24 persons with COPD who used the Omron and an Internet-mediated, 16-week walking program. At baseline, participants with COPD walked an average of 3429 +/- 1502 steps per day. Sixteen participants completed the program with an average increase in daily step count of 988 +/- 1048 steps (p = 0.002). The Omron is accurate in persons with COPD with usual walking speeds > 0.94 m/s. Accuracy is more variable at lower speeds, but the Omron captures more than 80% of manual step counts in most persons.In this preliminary study, an Internet-mediated walking program using the Omron significantly increased step counts in COPD."

Twenty patients with COPD participated in 5 weekly sessions of HRV biofeedback and 4 weekly sessions of walking practice with oximetry feedback, with instructions for daily home practice. Primary outcomes measures were the distance walked in 6 min (6MWD) and overall quality of life, as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Secondary outcomes included measures of self-efficacy, self-reported disability, anxiety, depression, dyspnea before and after the 6MWD, and HRV at the frequency of respiration during spontaneous and paced breathing. After 10 weeks of training, participants showed statistically and clinically significant improvements in 6MWD and quality of life. Significant changes were also seen in self-efficacy, disability, dyspnea before and after the 6MWD, and HRV amplitude during spontaneous breathing. We conclude that our intervention is feasible for patients with COPD and that further research using a randomized controlled design is warranted."

We compared the direct effects of a \"new\" ambulation aid (a modern draisine) with the effects of a rollator on 6-min walk distance (6MWD) in patients with COPD.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-one patients with COPD performed two 6-min walk tests (6MWTs) during prerehabilitation assessment (best 6MWD: 369 ± 88 m).

From the Covid-19 pandemic, the most affected population is the elderly (mean age 80 years old), with previous chronic diseases, in 18% with chronic respiratory. The aim of the present work was to validate and measure the outcomes produced by the recruitment and care of COPD patients enrolled by an Healthcare Local Authority in the corresponding Integrated Care Pathways (ICPs) in order to measure how a multidisciplinary, systemic and e-health monitored care impacts upon mortality and morbidity.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Enrolled patients were stratified through the GOLD guidelines classification, a unified method to discriminate the various degrees of severity of COPD, using specific spirometric cut-points and providing homogeneous classes of patients. Monitoring examinations include simple spirometry, global spirometry, diffusing capacity measurement, pulse oximetry, EGA, 6-minute walk test. Chest Rx, chest CT, ECG may also be required. The severity of COPD identifies the timing of monitoring, which involves a fixed annual re-assessment for mild offset clinical forms, biannually in case of exacerbation, a quarterly cadence in moderate forms that becomes bimonthly in severe forms.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In 2344 enrolled patients (46% women and 54% men, mean age 78 yo) 18% had GOLD severity 1, 35% GOLD 2, 27% GOLD 3 and 20% GOLD 4.

The data analysis showed that the population followed in e-health presented a 49% reduction in improper hospital admissions and a 68% reduction in clinical exacerbations compared to the population enrolled in the ICPs but not followed also in e-health. Smoking habits present at the time of patient enrollment in the ICPs remained in 49% of the total population enrolled and in 37% of the population enrolled in e-health. The patients enrolled in GOLD 1 and 2 obtained the same benefits both if treated in e- health and if treated in the clinic.

Indeed, the implemented diagnostic treatment protocols, if properly followed and monitored, are able to control complications and impact the mortality and disability of chronic disease. The advent of e-health and ICT tools are demonstrating a great support capacity for care taking that also allows greater adherence to patient care pathways, even more than the protocols up to now identified, characterized by a monitoring programmed over time, enhancing a patients and their families quality of life improvement."

On two consecutive days, 15 stable hypercapnic COPD patients underwent four endurance tests on a cycle ergometer at 80% of their maximal workrate, receiving, via a nasal mask in random order, either: 1) sham ventilation (CPAP: 1 cmH2O); 2) CPAP (6 cmH2O); 3) PSV (inspiratory pressure support: 12-16 cmH2O; expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP): 1 cmH2O); or 4) PAV (8.6+/-3.6 cmH2O x L(-1) and 3+/-1.3 cmH2O x L(-1)x s(-1) of volume and flow assistance, respectively plus EPAP: 1 cmH2O). Oxygen supply was standardized to maintain an arterial oxygen saturation (Sa,O2) of 92-93%. Breathing pattern and minute ventilation (by respiratory inductive plethysmography), pulse oximetry, end tidal partial pressure of CO2, cardiac frequency and sensations of dyspnoea and leg discomfort (by Borg scale) were monitored. In comparison to sham ventilation, PAV, PSV and CPAP were able to increase the endurance time (from 7.2+/-4.4 to 12+/-5.6, 10+/-5.2 and 9.6+/-4.6 min, respectively) and to reduce dyspnoea and oxygen flow to the nasal mask. However, the greatest improvement was observed with PAV. We conclude that PAV delivered by nasal mask can im-prove exercise tolerance and dyspnoea in stable hypercapnic COPD patients and hence this mode of ventilatory support may be useful in respiratory rehabilitation programmes."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the extent of correlation and agreement between arterial oxygen saturation and oxygen saturation as recorded by transcutaneous pulse oximetry, with a view to identifying whether pulse oximetry can be used as an alternative to arterial values in the clinical management of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive airways disease (COAD) in the emergency department. It also aims to determine whether there is a cut-off level of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry that can screen for significant systemic hypoxia in this group. This prospective study of patients with acute exacerbations of COAD who were deemed by their treating doctor to require an arterial blood gas analysis to determine their ventilatory status, compared arterial oxygen saturation with simultaneously recorded oxygen saturation measured by transcutaneous pulse oximetry. Data were analysed using Pearson correlation, bias plot (Bland-Altman) methods for agreement and the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve method for determination of a screening cut-off. Sixty-four sample-pairs were analysed for this study. Nine (14%) had significant hypoxia (arterial PO2 less than 60 mmHg). The correlation coefficient was 0.91. The bias (Bland-Altman) plot shows a constant bias of -0.758% and only fair agreement, with 95% limits for agreement of -8.2 to + 6.7%. With respect to the ROC curve analysis, the 'best' cut-off for detection of hypoxia was at oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry of 92% (sensitivity 100%, specificity 86%). In conclusion, there is not sufficient agreement for oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry to replace analysis of an arterial blood gas sample in the clinical evaluation of oxygenation in emergency patients with COAD. However, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry may be an effective screening test for systemic hypoxia, with the screening cut-off of 92% having sensitivity for the detection of systemic hypoxia of 100% with specificity of 86%."

            "abstract": "Physical inactivity is associated with comorbidities and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Although non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) is important for evaluating the physical activity level (PAL) of patients with chronic diseases, it has not yet been assessed in COPD patients. This study included male patients with COPD (n = 28) and high risk for COPD (n = 8). Total energy expenditure (TEE) and basal metabolic rate (BMR) were measured using the doubly labeled water (DLW) method and indirect calorimetry, respectively. PAL was calculated as TEE/BMR, while the NEAT was obtained from a questionnaire. Physical activity was also assessed using an accelerometer. The total NEAT score was correlated with PAL (r = 0.534, P < 0.001), while PAL was correlated more strongly with the non-locomotive NEAT score (r = 0.548, P < 0.001) than the locomotive NEAT score (r = 0.278, P = 0.10). Regarding accelerometer-obtained data, this questionnaire mainly reflected steps/day and the duration of light locomotive and non-locomotive daily activities. The NEAT score is a possible option for evaluating PAL in daily clinical practice. The present results indicated that non-locomotive activity may have a greater impact on PAL than locomotive activity in COPD patients."

(WO) intervention or standard care (SC). Enrollment occurred from July 1, 2015, to July 31, 2017; follow-up ended in July 2018. The setting was Kaiser Permanente Southern California sites. Participants were patients 40 years or older who had any COPD-related acute care use in the previous 12 months; only patients assigned to WO were approached for consent to participate in intervention activities.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nThe WO intervention included collaborative monitoring of PA step counts, semiautomated step goal recommendations, individualized reinforcement, and peer/family support. Standard COPD care could include referrals to pulmonary rehabilitation.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was a composite binary measure of all-cause hospitalizations, observation stays, emergency department visits, and death using adjusted logistic regression in the 12 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes included self-reported PA, COPD-related acute care use, symptoms, quality of life, and cardiometabolic markers.\n## RESULTS\nAll 2707 eligible patients (baseline mean [SD] age, 72 [10] years; 53.7% female; 74.3% of white race/ethnicity; and baseline mean [SD] percent forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration predicted, 61.0 [22.5]) were randomly assigned to WO (n = 1358) or SC (n = 1349). The intent-to-treat analysis showed no differences between WO and SC on the primary all-cause composite outcome (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.92-1.28; P = .33) or in the individual outcomes. Prespecified, as-treated analyses compared outcomes between all SC and 321 WO patients who participated in any intervention activities (23.6% [321 of 1358] uptake). The as-treated, propensity score-weighted model showed nonsignificant positive estimates in favor of WO participants compared with SC on all-cause hospitalizations (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65-1.10; P = .21) and death (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.35-1.11; P = .11). More WO participants reported engaging in PA compared with SC (47.4% [152 of 321] vs 30.7% [414 of 1349]; P < .001) and had improvements in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 10 physical health domain at 6 months. There were no group differences in other secondary outcomes.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nParticipation in a PA coaching program by patients with a history of COPD exacerbations was insufficient to effect improvements in acute care use or survival in the primary analysis.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02478359.\n"

However, cardiovascular diseases remain often undiagnosed in COPD. Assessment of the retinal microvasculature can provide value in cardiovascular profiling of these patients. Retinal microvascular assessment carried out via a noninvasive eye exam represents an easy to use tool when examining patients with COPD. The purpose of this review was to provide an overview of studies assessing structural and functional changes in the retinal microvasculature of patients with COPD. Findings demonstrated that structural and functional microvascular changes were more common and severe in COPD patients as compared to non-COPD controls, although few retinal investigations have been performed in patients with COPD. As cardiovascular comorbidities are highly prevalent in COPD, we advocate more research to investigate the value of an eye exam for microvascular phenotyping of COPD patients."

In the patients with chronic pulmonary disease, symptom-limited, incremental supine bicycle exercise and pulse oximetry were performed on and off high-flow oxygen. Technically adequate Doppler studies were initially obtained in 20 patients (56%) at rest and 14 (39%) on exercise; these numbers increased to 33 (92%) and 32 (89%), respectively, after enhancement with agitated saline (both p less than 0.001). In 10 patients with chronic lung disease who had simultaneous hemodynamic monitoring during exercise, the correlation between Doppler and catheter measurements of pulmonary artery systolic pressure was close (r = 0.98). Among controls, RVSP increased from 22 +/- 4 at rest (mean +/- SD) to 31 +/- 7 mm Hg at peak exercise. In patients with chronic lung disease, RVSP increased from 46 +/- 20 to 83 +/- 30 mm Hg (both p less than 0.001 vs. controls). Despite normal resting values for RVSP in 28% of study patients, nearly all showed abnormal increases in RVSP during supine bicycle exercise. Increases in RVSP during exercise were greatest in patients who showed oxyhemoglobin desaturation. The short-term administration of oxygen significantly blunted the increase in RVSP during exercise. Saline contrast-enhanced Doppler evaluation of tricuspid insufficiency seems a potentially valuable noninvasive method of determining the exercise response of RVSP in patients with chronic pulmonary disease."

A low physical activity level was related to the weather influencing health, financial constraints, health and shame.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We identified important facilitators to being physically active and barriers that could be amenable to change. Furthermore, we distinguished three important potential strategies for increasing physical activity in sedentary people with COPD, namely reducing barriers and increasing insight into health benefits, tailoring type of activity, and improvement of self-efficacy."

This pilot study aims to model the relationships between respiratory insufficiency and domains related to brain function, including low mood, subtly impaired cognition, systemic inflammation, and brain structural and neurochemical abnormalities. Nine healthy controls were compared with 18 age- and education-matched medically stable-COPD patients, half of whom were oxygen-dependent. Measures included depression, anxiety, cognition, health status, spirometry, oximetry at rest and during 6-minute walk, and resting plasma cytokines and soluble receptors, brain MRI, and MR spectroscopy in regions relevant to mood and cognition. ANOVA was used to compare controls with patients and with COPD subgroups (oxygen users [n = 9] and nonusers [n = 9]), and only variables showing group differences at p < or = 0.05 were included in multiple regressions controlling for age, gender, and education to develop the final model. Controls and COPD patients differed significantly in global cognition and memory, mood, and soluble TNFR1 levels but not brain structural or neurochemical measures. Multiple regressions identified pathways linking disease severity with impaired performance on sensitive cognitive processing measures, mediated through oxygen dependence, and with systemic inflammation (TNFR1), related through poor 6-minute walk performance. Oxygen desaturation with activity was related to indicators of brain tissue damage (increased frontal choline, which in turn was associated with subcortical white matter attenuation). This empirically derived model provides a conceptual framework for future studies of clinical interventions to protect the brain in patients with COPD, such as earlier oxygen supplementation for patients with desaturation during everyday activities."

A double-blinded trial was performed involving 29 nonhypoxemic patients (67 years, exercise SaO2 > 88%) with COPD (FEV1 = 36% predicted). All exercised on cycle ergometers for 45 minutes, 3 times per week for 7 weeks at high-intensity targets. During exercise, they received oxygen (3 L/minute) (n = 14) or compressed air (3 L/minute) (n = 15). Both groups had a higher exercise tolerance after training and when breathing oxygen. However, the oxygen-trained group increased the training work rate more rapidly than the air-trained group. The mean +/- SD work rate during the last week was 62 +/- 19 W (oxygen-trained group) and 52 +/- 22 W (air-trained group) (p < 0.01). After training, endurance in constant work rate tests increased more in the oxygen-trained group (14.5 minutes) than in the air-trained group (10.5 minutes) (p < 0.05). At isotime, the breathing rate decreased four breaths per minute in the oxygen-trained group and one breath per minute in the air-trained group (p = 0.001).

            "title": "Acute exacerbation of COPD.",
            "abstract": "The literature of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is fast expanding. This review focuses on several aspects of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) including epidemiology, diagnosis and management. COPD poses a major health and economic burden in the Asia-Pacific region, as it does worldwide. Triggering factors of AECOPD include infectious (bacteria and viruses) and environmental (air pollution and meteorological effect) factors. Disruption in the dynamic balance between the 'pathogens' (viral and bacterial) and the normal bacterial communities that constitute the lung microbiome likely contributes to the risk of exacerbations. The diagnostic approach to AECOPD varies based on the clinical setting and severity of the exacerbation. After history and examination, a number of investigations may be useful, including oximetry, sputum culture, chest X-ray and blood tests for inflammatory markers. Arterial blood gases should be considered in severe exacerbations, to characterize respiratory failure. Depending on the severity, the acute management of AECOPD involves use of bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics, oxygen and noninvasive ventilation. Hospitalization may be required, for severe exacerbations. Nonpharmacological interventions including disease-specific self-management, pulmonary rehabilitation, early medical follow-up, home visits by respiratory health workers, integrated programmes and telehealth-assisted hospital at home have been studied during hospitalization and shortly after discharge in patients who have had a recent AECOPD. Pharmacological approaches to reducing risk of future exacerbations include long-acting bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, mucolytics, vaccinations and long-term macrolides. Further studies are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of these interventions in preventing COPD exacerbations."

How does oxygen therapy influence cerebral blood flow, cerebral oxygen delivery and neurovascular function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients? What is the main finding and its importance? Oxygen therapy improves cerebral oxygen delivery and neurovascular function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. This improvement in cerebral oxygen delivery and neurovascular function might provide a physiological link between oxygen therapy and a reduced risk of cerebrovascular disease (e.g. stroke, mild cognitive impairment and dementia) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n    \n\n\n          Abstract:\n        \n      \n      We investigated the role of hypoxaemia in cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen delivery (CDO2 ) and neurovascular coupling (coupling of CBF to neural activity; NVC) in hypoxaemic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (n = 14). Resting CBF (duplex ultrasound), peripheral oxyhaemoglobin saturation (SpO2; pulse-oximetry) and NVC (transcranial Doppler) were assessed before and after a 20 min wash-in of supplemental oxygen (∼3 l min-1 ). The peripheral oxyhaemoglobin saturation increased from 91.0 ± 3.3 to 97.4 ± 3.0% (P < 0.01), whereas CBF was unaltered (593.0 ± 162.8 versus 590.1 ± 138.5 ml min-1 ; P = 0.91) with supplemental O2 . In contrast, both CDO2 (98.1 ± 25.7 versus 108.7 ± 28.4 ml dl-1 ; P = 0.02) and NVC were improved. Specifically, the posterior cerebral artery cerebrovascular conductance was increased to a greater extent after O2 normalization (+40%, from 20.4 ± 9.9 to 28.0 ± 10.4% increase in conductance; P = 0.04), whereas the posterior cerebral artery cerebrovascular resistance decreased to a greater extent during O2 normalization (+22%, from -16.7 ± 7.3 to -21.4 ± 6.6% decrease in resistance; P = 0.04). The cerebral vasculature of COPD patients appears insensitive to oxygen, because CBF was unaltered in response to O2 supplementation leading to improved CDO2 . In patients, the improvements in CDO2 and neurovascular function with supplemental O2 may underlie the cognitive benefits associated with O2 therapy."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is the only component of the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that improves survival in patients with severe daytime hypoxemia. LTOT is usually provided by a stationary oxygen concentrator and is recommended to be used for at least 15-18 h a day. Several studies have demonstrated a deterioration in arterial blood gas pressures and oxygen saturation during sleep in patients with COPD, even in those not qualifying for LTOT. The suggestion has been made that the natural progression of COPD to its end stages of chronic pulmonary hypertension, severe hypoxemia, right heart failure, and death is dependent upon the severity of desaturation occurring during sleep. The primary objective of the International Nocturnal Oxygen (INOX) trial is to determine, in patients with COPD not qualifying for LTOT but who present significant nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturation, whether nocturnal oxygen provided for a period of 3 years decreases mortality or delay the prescription of LTOT.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The INOX trial is a 3-year, multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of nocturnal oxygen therapy added to usual care. Eligible patients are those with a diagnosis of COPD supported by a history of past smoking and obstructive disease who fulfill our definition of significant nocturnal oxygen desaturation (i.e., ≥ 30% of the recording time with transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation < 90% on either of two consecutive recordings). Patients allocated in the control group receive room air delivered by a concentrator modified to deliver 21% oxygen. The comparison is double blind. The primary outcome is a composite of mortality from all cause or requirement for LTOT. Secondary outcomes include quality of life and utility measures, costs from a societal perspective and compliance with oxygen therapy. The follow-up period is intended to last at least 3 years.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The benefits of LTOT have been demonstrated whereas those of nocturnal oxygen therapy alone have not.

We aimed to identify markers of hypoxemia that can be used in the evaluation of patients in addition to pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases, especially those that could respond after 1 month of oxygen use. We performed a prospective pilot study at 2240 m above sea level, with repeated measurements before and after (b/a) 1-month home oxygen therapy in 70 patients with lung diseases, of which 24/20 have COPD, 41/39 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and 5/2 with interstitial lung diseases (ILD), all of them having chronic hypoxemia, as well as 70 healthy subjects as controls. Proteins evaluated included HIF-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and erythropoietin (EPO). Among the main results, we found that hypoxemic patients had normal levels of HIF-1α but increased EPO compared with healthy controls. VEGF levels were heterogeneous in the sample studied, similar to the control group in COPD, slightly increased in OSA, and decreased in fibrosis. With oxygen treatment, the HIF-1α and EPO decreased in COPD and OSA but not in fibrosis, and VEGF remained constant over time. In conclusion, erythropoietin and HIF-1α identified hypoxemia initially and responded to oxygen.

The following were evaluated postintervention, after 3 months, and after 12 months: exercise capacity (endurance shuttle test [EST]), physical activity (steps/day and modified Baecke questionnaire), quality of life (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]), dyspnoea (modified Medical Research Council scale), and exacerbations.\n## RESULTS\nPostintervention, the EG showed significant improvements in EST times (7.6 min [4.4, 10.7]), distance (549 m [282, 815]; p < 0.01, both), number of steps (3,361 [1,553, 5,118]), and Baecke scores (1.6 [0.2, 3.1], p < 0.01). SGRQ scores decreased (-5.4 [-8.6, -2.4], p < 0.01). These results remained evident after 3 and 12 months (p < 0.01). There were no differences between the groups nor in the exacerbations or dyspnoea. A significant association was found between increase in physical activity level, improvement in exercise capacity, and quality of life during the period monitored.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA community-based programme of exercise training through walking and increased physical activity, using pedometers as feedback, produces short- and long-term improvements in exercise capacity, physical activity level, and quality of life in COPD patients.\n"

            "abstract": "In recent years, increased attention has been directed to sleep apnea syndrome due to its high prevalence and preventable severe health consequences. Besides enhancing the risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and metabolic disorders, it determines increased daytime somnolence, cognitive impairment, and delayed reaction time. These symptoms, determined by sleep fragmentation and chronic hypoxemia, can result in a decrease in professional performance and, moreover, could have tragic implications, especially in patients with high-risk professions. We present the case of a 58-year-old male-truck driver, known to suffer from uncontrolled OSA and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who presented to our ENT department for incapacitating daytime somnolence and severe nasal obstruction. These symptoms were caused by a voluminous sinonasal inverted papilloma, occupying the entire left cavity with extension in the nasopharynx. Following nose permeabilization, the patients' APAP compliance grew substantially, with a dramatic decrease in daytime sleepiness and improvement in polysomnographic parameters. Due to the overlap syndrome of OSA and COPD, an oxygen supplementation was added to PAP therapy by a pulmonologist, improving pulse-oximetry parameters and resulting in the best outcome for the patient. Through this case report, we aim to emphasize the importance of multimodal, personalized treatment of sleep apnea with a focus on nasal surgical permeabilization. At the same time, we sustain a multidisciplinary approach, especially in patients with sleep apnea and associated pathologies, to obtain therapeutic success. We propose increased attention to the early recognition and proper treatment of sleep apnea in patients with high-risk professions as it prevents catastrophes."

Exacerbation detection is based on 12 symptom-related yes-or-no questions and the measurement of peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and body temperature. Automated treatment advice is based on a decision model built by clinical expert panel opinion and Bayesian network modeling. The current paper describes the validity of ACCESS.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed secondary analyses on data from a 3-month prospective observational study in which patients with COPD registered respiratory symptoms daily on diary cards and measured SpO2, FEV1, and body temperature.

One or more of the different pieces of ACCESS advice were provided in 71.7% of all cases. We identified 115 symptom-based exacerbations. Cross-tabulation showed a sensitivity of 97.4% (95% CI 92.0-99.3), specificity of 65.6% (95% CI 63.5-67.6), and positive and negative predictive value of 13.4% (95% CI 11.2-15.9) and 99.8% (95% CI 99.3-99.9), respectively, for ACCESS' advice to contact a health care professional in case of an exacerbation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In many cases (71.7%), ACCESS gave at least one self-management advice to lower symptom burden, showing that ACCES provides self-management support for both day-to-day symptom variations and exacerbations. High sensitivity shows that if there is an exacerbation, ACCESS will advise patients to contact a health care professional. The high negative predictive value leads us to conclude that when ACCES does not provide the advice to contact a health care professional, the risk of an exacerbation is very low. Thus, ACCESS can safely be used in patients with COPD to support self-management in case of an exacerbation."

The aim of this study was threefold: to establish the technical feasibility of transmitting real-time pulse oximetry data, determine the validity of remote measurements compared to conventional face-to-face measures, and evaluate the participants' perception of the usability of the technology. Thirty-seven healthy individuals participated in a single remote pulmonary rehabilitation exercise session, conducted using the eHAB telerehabilitation system. Validity was assessed by comparing the participant's oxygen saturation and heart rate with the data set received at the therapist's remote location. There was an 80% exact agreement between participant and therapist data sets. The mean absolute difference and Bland and Altman's limits of agreement fell within the minimum clinically important difference for both oxygen saturation and heart rate values. Participants found the system easy to use and felt confident that they would be able to use it at home. Remote measurement of pulse oximetry data for a pulmonary rehabilitation exercise session was feasible and valid when compared to conventional face-to-face methods."

Self-efficacy did not improve in the control condition and no moderators were identified. Self-efficacy for coping with exercise barriers was the self-efficacy subtype most strongly related to step count.

Telehealth is most commonly used for baseline monitoring and to allow early detection of exacerbations, with 54% believing it to be effective. The three most commonly monitored variables were oxygen saturation, heart rate and breathlessness. A variety of methods were used to set alarm limits with the majority of respondents believing that at least 40% of alarms were false.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Around one-third of responded community COPD services are using telehealth, believing it to be effective without robust evidence, with a variety of variables monitored, a variety of hardware and varying techniques to set alarm limits with high false alarm frequencies."

Despite the widespread use of PDOCDs in awake and ambulating patients, few studies report their use during sleep. This study was designed to compare heart rate and oxygen saturation (measured via pulse oximetry [S(pO2)]) of sleeping patients using one brand of PDOCD versus continuous-flow oxygen.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We studied 10 home-oxygen patients who were using various continuous-flow oxygen systems and prescriptions. Baseline asleep and awake S(pO2) and heart rate were recorded while the patients used their existing home-oxygen systems (liquid oxygen or oxygen concentrator with nasal cannula) and continuous-flow oxygen prescription. Patients were then switched to a nasal cannula connected to a PDOCD. The PDOCD setting was adjusted to produce an S(pO2) equal to the patient's awake baseline on continuous-flow. This setting was then used while the patient subsequently slept. Mean values for S(pO2) and heart rate and hours of sleep were calculated by the software in the oximeter. Mean values for S(pO2) and heart rate were compared with the paired Student's t test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was a statistically significant but clinically unimportant S(pO2) difference between the patients who used continuous-flow oxygen and those who used the PDOCD (95.7% vs 93.2%, respectively, p = 0.043). There was no difference in heart rate (77.3 beats/min vs 77.9 beats/min, p = 0.70). The sample size was adequate to detect a difference in heart rate of 5 beats/min at a power of 80%. For the subset of patients whose PDOCD triggering sensitivity was set on sensitive (vs the default lower sensitivity) there was a statistically significant but clinically unimportant S(pO2) difference (continuous-flow 95.6% vs PDOCD 93.2%, p = 0.044). All other comparisons showed no differences, but the samples sizes were too small to make any firm conclusions. One patient experienced an 11% S(pO2) drop with the PDOCD because of an inadequate triggering sensitivity setting.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The PDOCD model we studied was able to deliver oxygen therapy (via nasal cannula) comparable to continuous-flow in 9 of 10 patients. The resting daytime S(pO2) on continuous-flow appears to be an appropriate target for setting the PDOCD to ensure adequate oxygenation, even during sleep, with the PDOCD we tested. We conclude that the PDOCD we tested is able to maintain adequate S(pO2) during sleep in selected patients. Because of differences in design, triggering-signal sensitivity, and oxygen-pulse volume, these results cannot be generalized to all patients or all oxygen-conserving devices. Further research is needed to determine the general performance of PDOCDs on larger populations of oxygen-dependent patients and patients with sleep-disordered breathing."

            "abstract": "Dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and activity restriction are already apparent in mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, patients may not seek medical help until their symptoms become troublesome and persistent and significant respiratory impairment is already present; as a consequence, further sustained physical inactivity may contribute to disease progression. Ventilatory and gas exchange impairment, cardiac dysfunction, and skeletal muscle dysfunction are present to a variable degree in patients with mild COPD, and collectively may contribute to exercise intolerance. As such, there is increasing interest in evaluating exercise tolerance and physical activity in symptomatic patients with COPD who have mild airway obstruction, as defined by spirometry. Simple questionnaires, eg, the modified British Medical Research Council dyspnea scale and the COPD Assessment Test, or exercise tests, eg, the 6-minute or incremental and endurance exercise tests can be used to assess exercise performance and functional status. Pedometers and accelerometers are used to evaluate physical activity, and endurance tests (cycle or treadmill) using constant work rate protocols are used to assess the effects of interventions such as pulmonary rehabilitation. In addition, alternative outcome measurements, such as tests of small airway dysfunction and laboratory-based exercise tests, are used to measure the extent of physiological impairment in individuals with persistent dyspnea. This review describes the mechanisms of exercise limitation in patients with mild COPD and the interventions that can potentially improve exercise tolerance. Also discussed are the benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation and the potential role of pharmacologic treatment in symptomatic patients with mild COPD."

There was no significant difference between Th and placebo in sleep quality. Th treatment was associated with a marginal improvement in nocturnal oxygenation in most of the patients; the average nocturnal SaO2 ranged from 84.4%-92.8% during Th and from 82.2-90.5% during placebo treatment, respectively. Only in the morning, during the last 2 h in bed, was the slight difference in SaO2 statistically significant in favour of Th.

Adventitious lung sounds including crackles, wheezes, rhonchi, bronchial breath sounds, stridor or pleural rub and abnormal breathing patterns function as essential clinical biomarkers for the early identification, accurate diagnosis and monitoring of pulmonary disorders. Here, we present a wearable sensor module comprising of a hermetically encapsulated, high precision accelerometer contact microphone (ACM) which enables both episodic and longitudinal assessment of lung sounds, breathing patterns and respiratory rates using a single integrated sensor. This enhanced ACM sensor leverages a nano-gap transduction mechanism to achieve high sensitivity to weak high frequency vibrations occurring on the surface of the skin due to underlying lung pathologies. The performance of the ACM sensor was compared to recordings from a state-of-art digital stethoscope, and the efficacy of the developed system is demonstrated by conducting an exploratory research study aimed at recording pathological mechano-acoustic signals from hospitalized patients with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, pneumonia, and acute decompensated heart failure. This unobtrusive wearable system can enable both episodic and longitudinal evaluation of lung sounds that allow for the early detection and/or ongoing monitoring of pulmonary disease."

            "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most prevalent lung diseases worldwide. COPD patients show major dysfunction in cardiac autonomic modulation due to sustained hypoxaemia, which has been significantly related to higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is a frequent comorbidity in COPD patients. It has been found that patients suffering from both COPD and OSAS simultaneously, the so-called overlap syndrome, have notably higher morbidity and mortality. Heart rate variability (HRV) has demonstrated to be useful to assess changes in autonomic functioning in different clinical conditions. However, there is still little scientific evidence on the magnitude of changes in cardiovascular dynamics elicited by the combined effect of both respiratory diseases, particularly during sleep, when apnoeic events occur. In this regard, we hypothesised that a non-linear analysis is able to provide further insight into long-term dynamics of overnight cardiovascular modulation. Accordingly, this study is aimed at assessing the usefulness of sample entropy (SampEn) to distinguish changes in overnight pulse rate variability (PRV) recordings among three patient groups while sleeping: COPD, moderate-to-severe OSAS, and overlap syndrome. In order to achieve this goal, a population composed of 297 patients were studied: 22 with COPD alone, 213 showing moderate-to-severe OSAS, and 62 with COPD and moderate-to-severe OSAS simultaneously (COPD+OSAS). Cardiovascular dynamics were analysed using pulse rate (PR) recordings from unattended pulse oximetry carried out at patients' home. Conventional time- and frequency- domain analyses were performed to characterise sympathetic and parasympathetic activation of the nervous system, while SampEn was applied to quantify long-term changes in irregularity. Our analyses revealed that overnight PRV recordings from COPD+OSAS patients were significantly more irregular (higher SampEn) than those from patients with COPD alone (0.267 [0.210-0.407] vs. 0.212 [0.151-0.267]; p < 0.05) due to recurrent apnoeic events during the night. Similarly, COPD + OSAS patients also showed significantly higher irregularity in PRV during the night than subjects with OSAS alone (0.267 [0.210-0.407] vs. 0.241 [0.189-0.325]; p = 0.05), which suggests that the cumulative effect of both diseases increases disorganization of pulse rate while sleeping. On the other hand, no statistical significant differences were found between COPD and COPD + OSAS patients when traditional frequency bands (LF and HF) were analysed. We conclude that SampEn is able to properly quantify changes in overnight cardiovascular dynamics of patients with overlap syndrome, which could be useful to assess cardiovascular impairment in COPD patients due to the presence of concomitant OSAS."

Twenty-nine patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and with a ventilatory limited exercise capacity (forced expiratory volume in one second < 60% predicted, breathing reserve at maximal exercise < 20% of maximally voluntary ventilation, resting arterial oxygen tension > or = 8 kPa (60 mmHg), end-exercise arterial oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry > or = 85%) completed an 8-week supervised outpatient cycle exercise programme. Fourteen patients were randomised to training with inspiratory pressure support of 10 cmH2O and 15 patients to training with control (sham) inspiratory pressure support of 5 cmH2O. Outcome measures were the incremental shuttle walking test and a constant-load cycle endurance test at 75% of peak work rate including the measurement of physiological responses, and health status measured using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire. Statistically significant between-group differences were found in favour of the inspiratory pressure support of 10 cmH2O group for improvement in shuttle walking distance (16+/-17 versus 3+/-13%), cycle endurance (164+/-124 versus 88+/-128%), and the reduction in minute ventilation during exercise (-11+/-10 versus -2+/-9%). It was concluded that exercise training with inspiratory pressure support of 10 cmH2O resulted in statistically significantly larger improvements in exercise performance than training with inspiratory pressure support of 5 cmH2O in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease suffering from a ventilatory limited exercise capacity. Inspiratory pressure support of 10 cmH2O may be considered as adjunct during high-intensity exercise training."

Participants underwent a 3-week inpatient PR program. The primary outcome was the change in the number of steps during the 6MST measured before and after PR. The secondary outcome included the change in the 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) pulse oximetry, heart rate, dyspnea, and leg discomfort during the tests measured before and after PR. MID was determined by anchor-based and distribution approaches.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After PR, we observed a significant increase in the number of steps during the 6MST (22.5 steps; 95% CI 13.8-31.3; p < 0.0001) and in the 6MWD (26.6 m; 95% CI 17.6-35.5; p < 0.0001). The 6MST and 6MWT were improved by 10.1 and 6.5%, respectively. The number of steps during the 6MST was significantly correlated with the 6MWD before (r = 0.72; p < 0.0001) and after PR (r = 0.66; p < 0.0001).

Thirty-one very severe COPD patients undergoing oxygen-therapy were recruited. Three titration methods were randomly performed: (1) 6-min walking tests; (2) cycle-ergometer constant work-rate tests at a load equivalent to 12 ml/min/kg of oxygen uptake; (3) one single constant work-rate test at 40 W 12-h pulse-oximeter monitoring was performed on four consecutive days with the following oxygen flow during exercise: 1 l·min(-1) above the resting prescription (NOTT guidelines) and those established by the titration procedures. The time spent SpO(2) < 90% was higher for the titration based on NOTT and walking tests than for the oxygen flow established by the constant work-rate tests at 12 ml O(2)/min/kg (22.1 ± 18.7, 20.8 ± 19.5 and 6.7 ± 12.7%, respectively). As for the oxygen uptake-based titration, the simplified procedure (a single exercise test at 40 w) generates longer times spent SpO(2) < 90% and SpO(2) < 85%, although it maintains a SpO(2) > 90% for more 90% of the time. In COPD patients, exercise oxygen flow titrations by NOTT guidelines or walking tests do not allow a suitable oxygenation during the activities of daily life. Two more adequate alternative methods, based on constant work-rate tests, are proposed."

            "abstract": "This document summarizes the work of the COPD Technical Expert Panel working group. For patients with COPD, the most pressing current coverage barriers identified were onerous diagnostic requirements focused on oxygenation (rather than ventilation) and difficulty obtaining bilevel devices with backup rate capabilities. Because of these difficulties, many patients with COPD were instead sometimes prescribed home mechanical ventilators. Critical evidence supports changes to current policies, including randomized controlled trial evidence suggesting a mortality benefit from bilevel positive airway pressure with backup rate and updated clinical practice guidelines from the American Thoracic Society as well as the European Respiratory Society. To achieve optimal access to noninvasive ventilation for patients with COPD, we make the following key recommendations: (1) removal of the need for overnight oximetry testing; (2) the ability to initiate therapy using bilevel devices with backup rate capability; and (3) increased duration of time to meet adherence criteria (ie, a second 90-day trial period) in those patients actively engaged in their care. Clear guidelines based on medical necessity are also included for patients who require initiation of or switch to a home mechanical ventilator. Adoption of these proposed recommendations would result in the right device, for the right type of patient with COPD, at the right time. Finally, we emphasize the need for adequate clinical support during initiation and maintenance of home noninvasive ventilation in such patients."

Despite the frequent use of SpO2 measurements in telemonitoring of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), no profound overview is available about these measurements. Areas covered: A systematic search identified 71 articles that performed SpO2 measurements in COPD telemonitoring. The results indicate that long-term follow-up of COPD patients using daily SpO2 spot checks is practically feasible. Very few studies specified protocols for performing these measurements. In many studies, deviating SpO2 values were used to raise alerts that led to immediate action from healthcare professionals. However, little information was available about the exact implementation and performance of these alerts. Therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn about the real value of SpO2 measurements. Future research could optimize performance of alerts using individualized, time-dependent thresholds or predictive algorithms to account for individual differences and SpO2 baseline changes. Additionally, the value of performing continuous measurements should be examined. Expert commentary: Standardization of the measurements, data science techniques and advancing technology can still boost performance of telemonitoring applications. All these opportunities should be thoroughly explored to assess the real value of SpO2 in COPD telemonitoring."

            "abstract": "During pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), patients receive individually tailored walking exercise training. The personalised nature of exercise prescription is a fundamental component of PR. Despite this, the measurement of physical activity (PA) has been limited to a 'one size fits all' approach and can be challenging to translate into clinically meaningful or real-world units, such as cadence. This discrepancy may partly explain the inconsistent evidence for the impact of PR on PA. It may also provide an opportunity to standardise PA assessment in the context of chronic respiratory disease (CRD) and PR, where field-based walking tests are routine measures. This technical note provides an example of how to develop personalised PA intensity thresholds, calibrated against an individual's performance on the Incremental Shuttle Walking Test (ISWT; maximal) and Endurance Shuttle Walk Test (ESWT; sub-maximal). These are externally paced tests, with each level (speed) of the tests denoting a specific speed (intensity); ranging 1.8 km/h (ISWT Level 1) to 8.5 km/h (ISWT Level 12). From the ESWT, it becomes possible to evaluate adherence to each individual's walking exercise prescription. Future research should explore this approach and its responsiveness to PR. It may be possible to extend this methodology with the inclusion of physiological parameters (e.g., heart rate, calorimetry, and oxygen consumption) to derive relative intensity markers (e.g. moderate-to-vigorous), accounting for individual differences in exercise capacity, under the same paradigm as PR exercise prescription."

The clinical associations of this for recovery after hospital admission are poorly understood despite sleep disturbance contributing to morbidity in other scenarios. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and nature of sleep disturbance after discharge following hospital admission for COVID-19 and to assess whether this was associated with dyspnoea.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      CircCOVID was a prospective multicentre cohort substudy designed to investigate the effects of circadian disruption and sleep disturbance on recovery after COVID-19 in a cohort of participants aged 18 years or older, admitted to hospital for COVID-19 in the UK, and discharged between March, 2020, and October, 2021. Participants were recruited from the Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID). Follow-up data were collected at two timepoints: an early time point 2-7 months after hospital discharge and a later time point 10-14 months after hospital discharge. Sleep quality was assessed subjectively using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and a numerical rating scale. Sleep quality was also assessed with an accelerometer worn on the wrist (actigraphy) for 14 days. Participants were also clinically phenotyped, including assessment of symptoms (ie, anxiety [Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale questionnaire], muscle function [SARC-F questionnaire], dyspnoea [Dyspnoea-12 questionnaire] and measurement of lung function), at the early timepoint after discharge. Actigraphy results were also compared to a matched UK Biobank cohort (non-hospitalised individuals and recently hospitalised individuals). Multivariable linear regression was used to define associations of sleep disturbance with the primary outcome of breathlessness and the other clinical symptoms. PHOSP-COVID is registered on the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN10980107).\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      2320 of 2468 participants in the PHOSP-COVID study attended an early timepoint research visit a median of 5 months (IQR 4-6) following discharge from 83 hospitals in the UK. Data for sleep quality were assessed by subjective measures (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and the numerical rating scale) for 638 participants at the early time point. Sleep quality was also assessed using device-based measures (actigraphy) a median of 7 months (IQR 5-8 months) after discharge from hospital for 729 participants. After discharge from hospital, the majority (396 [62%] of 638) of participants who had been admitted to hospital for COVID-19 reported poor sleep quality in response to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. A comparable proportion (338 [53%] of 638) of participants felt their sleep quality had deteriorated following discharge after COVID-19 admission, as assessed by the numerical rating scale. Device-based measurements were compared to an age-matched, sex-matched, BMI-matched, and time from discharge-matched UK Biobank cohort who had recently been admitted to hospital. Compared to the recently hospitalised matched UK Biobank cohort, participants in our study slept on average 65 min (95% CI 59 to 71) longer, had a lower sleep regularity index (-19%; 95% CI -20 to -16), and a lower sleep efficiency (3·83 percentage points; 95% CI 3·40 to 4·26). Similar results were obtained when comparisons were made with the non-hospitalised UK Biobank cohort. Overall sleep quality (unadjusted effect estimate 3·94; 95% CI 2·78 to 5·10), deterioration in sleep quality following hospital admission (3·00; 1·82 to 4·28), and sleep regularity (4·38; 2·10 to 6·65) were associated with higher dyspnoea scores. Poor sleep quality, deterioration in sleep quality, and sleep regularity were also associated with impaired lung function, as assessed by forced vital capacity. Depending on the sleep metric, anxiety mediated 18-39% of the effect of sleep disturbance on dyspnoea, while muscle weakness mediated 27-41% of this effect.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Sleep disturbance following hospital admission for COVID-19 is associated with dyspnoea, anxiety, and muscle weakness. Due to the association with multiple symptoms, targeting sleep disturbance might be beneficial in treating the post-COVID-19 condition.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      UK Research and Innovation, National Institute for Health Research, and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council."

In >1000 patients tested, adverse effects have been minimal. However, previous studies have included few patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

In 2 separate multicenter, phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-administration clinical trials, 146 patients in the CHF study and 134 patients in the COPD study received either perflenapent emulsion or saline placebo during an echocardiographic examination. Perflenapent emulsion was well tolerated in patients with CHF or COPD. The adverse event rates with perflenapent emulsion (15%) were similar to those with saline (11%; P =.43) in the combined groups, and similar findings were seen when analyzed by CHF or COPD groups separately. All adverse events were rated as mild, required no treatment, resolved spontaneously, and left no sequelae.

Twenty-one non- or mildly-hypoxemic males (FEV(1) = 40.1 +/- 10.7% predicted) were randomly assigned to IPS (16 cmH(2)O) + PEEP (5 cmH(2)O) or spontaneous ventilation during constant-work rate (70-80% peak) exercise tests to the limit of tolerance (T (lim)). Heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO) were monitored by transthoracic cardioimpedance (Physioflow, Manatec, France). Oxyhemoglobin saturation was assessed by pulse oximetry (SpO(2)). At similar SpO(2), IPS(16) + PEEP(5) was associated with heterogeneous cardiovascular effects compared with the control trial. Therefore, 11 patients (Group A) showed stable or increased Delta \"isotime\" - rest SV [5 (0-29) mL], lower DeltaHR but similar DeltaCO. On the other hand, DeltaSV [-10 (-15 to -3) mL] and DeltaHR were both lower with IPS(16) + PEEP(5) in Group B (N = 10), thereby reducing DeltaCO (p < 0.05). Group B showed higher resting lung volumes, and T (lim) improved with IPS(16) + PEEP(5) only in Group A [51 (-60 to 486) vs. 115 (-210 to 909) s, respectively; p < 0.05]. We conclude that IPS(16) + PEEP(5) may improve SV and exercise tolerance in selected patients with advanced COPD. Impaired SV and CO responses, associated with a lack of enhancement in exercise capacity, were found in a sub-group of patients who were particularly hyperinflated at rest."

            "abstract": "The primary abnormality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is chronic airway inflammation which results in airflow limitation. Disease progression is usually depicted as an accelerated decline in FEV(1) over time. However, COPD patients also manifest progressive static hyperinflation due to the combined effects of reduced lung elastic recoil and increased airway resistance. Superimposed on static hyperinflation are further increases in operational lung volumes (dynamic hyperinflation) brought on during exercise, exacerbations or tachypnea. An important consequence of exertional dyspnea is activity limitation. COPD patients have been shown to spend only a third of the day walking or standing compared with age-matched healthy individuals who spend more than half of their time in these activities. Furthermore, the degree of activity limitation measured by an accelerometer worsens with disease progression. COPD patients have been shown to have an accelerated loss of aerobic capacity (VO(2)max) and this correlates with mortality just as is seen with hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Thus physical inactivity is an important therapeutic target in COPD. Summarizing; airflow obstruction leads to progressive hyperinflation, activity limitation, physical deconditioning and other comorbidities that characterize the COPD phenotype. Targeting the airflow obstruction with long-acting bronchodilator therapy in conjunction with a supervised exercise prescription is currently the most effective therapeutic intervention in earlier COPD. Other important manifestations of skeletal muscle dysfunction include muscle atrophy and weakness. These specific problems are best addressed with resistance training with consideration of anabolic supplementation."

Eighty-eight patients with stable COPD (71m/17f; mean +/- SD age, 60 +/-8 year; FEV1, 43+/-14% pred) were recruited, 66 of whom performed a hospital-based 10-day walking training, whereas 22 were treated as control. On day 16MTD, and on days 8 and 10, 6MTD and 6MWD were determined. In addition, patients used an accelerometer (TriTrac-R3D) to record 24 h-activity, whereby training sessions were excluded. In both groups there was a linear relationship (r > or = 0.84 and P < 0.0001) between 6MTD and 24 h-activity, the slope of which was 2.5-fold greater in the training group (P < 0.01). Similar relationships emerged for 6MWD. There was no association between baseline 6MTD, FEV1 or BMI and any of the other measures. These data suggest that daily activity did not markedly vary with exercise capacity under baseline conditions. Participation in a training program increased activity significantly stronger than predicted from the gain in exercise capacity.

            "abstract": "The co-existence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), termed the overlap syndrome (OVS), is associated with adverse outcomes that may be reversed with treatment. However, diagnosis is limited by the apparent need for in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG). WatchPAT is a portable diagnostic device that is validated for the diagnosis of OSA that might represent an attractive tool for the diagnosis of OVS.Subjects with established COPD were recruited from a general population. Subjects underwent PSG and simultaneous recording with WatchPAT. Pulmonary function testing and questionnaires were also performed.A total of 36 subjects were recruited and valid data was obtained on 33 (age 63 ± 7, BMI 28 ± 7, 61% male, FEV1 56 ± 20% predicted). There was no significant difference in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) between PSG and WatchPAT (19 ± 20 versus 20 ± 15 events/h; mean difference 2(-2, 5) events/h; p = 0.381). The AHI was not significantly different in rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) determined by PSG versus REM and NREM determined by WatchPAT. WatchPAT slightly overestimated total and REM sleep time, and sleep efficiency. The sensitivity of WatchPAT at an AHI cut-off of ≥5, ≥15, and ≥30 events/h for corresponding PSG AHI cut-offs was 95.8, 92.3, and 88.9, respectively; specificity was 55, 65.0, and 95.8, respectively.WatchPAT is able to determine OSA reliably in patients with COPD. The availability of this additional diagnostic modality may lead to improved detection of OVS, which may in turn lead to improved outcomes for a group of COPD patients at high risk of poor outcomes."

Adherence to LTOT guidelines is problematic, both because efficacy has been demonstrated only in specific groups of COPD patients, and because it implies high costs. Introduces treatment high costs. The aim of our study was to examine retrospectively the adherence to LTOT guidelines in a sample of medical records of patients prescribed LTOT between January 2005 and December 2006 in two Italian university hospitals (Ferrara and Modena). Out of a total of 191 medical records of patients prescribed LTOT, only 157 had adequate clinical data considering the three main criteria for appropriateness (arterial blood gas and/or pulse oximetry measurement, oxygen administration, smoking status). Out of these 157 patients, only 73 (46.5 %) fulfilled all three criteria recommended by the guidelines. Adherence was higher for LTOT prescribed by pulmonologists compared to internists. This survey showed that the adherence to LTOT guidelines in a sample of medical records of patients prescribed LTOT is poor. Considering the high costs and the impact on the patients' quality of life of LTOT, these results suggest that the adherence should be carefully monitored."

            "abstract": "Background: A self-monitoring approach utilizing fitness trackers that provide feedback regarding physical activities has been recently applied to rehabilitation patients to promote voluntary walking activities. Although this approach has been proven to increase physical activity, it is uncertain whether the intervention improves walking ability. Aim: This review investigated whether the additional self-monitoring approach using activity trackers would improve walking ability in any type of rehabilitation setting. Methods: A systematic search was performed in four databases [PubMed (MEDLINE), The Cochrane Library, SPORTDiscus, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature] to identify studies that examined the self-monitoring approach combined with rehabilitative intervention vs. the same rehabilitative intervention only in participants with any unhealthy conditions. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of all the retrieved English literature published from 2009 to 2019, then discussed the final inclusion. The risk of bias was assessed referring to the criteria of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The key findings were synthesized using narrative synthesis. In addition, a quantitative synthesis was conducted when more than two studies investigating the same disease were identified. Results: Eleven randomized controlled trials satisfied the eligibility criteria, nine of which had a lower risk of bias. The types of diseases included stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, Parkinson's disease, hemophilia, peripheral artery disease, post-total knee arthroplasty, and geriatric rehabilitation. Eight studies reported measures of walking endurance and four reported measures of gait speed. In the quantitative synthesis of two studies investigating COPD, there was a significant between-group difference in terms of changes in the 6-min walking distance from the baseline, which was favorable to the additional self-monitoring intervention group (mean difference: 13.1 m; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-24.5; 2 studies, 124 participants; p = 0.02; I 2 = 0%). Other available data revealed no consistent evidence regarding effectiveness of the intervention. Conclusions: The findings indicate that there is little evidence suggesting the effectiveness of the self-monitoring approach in improving walking ability in rehabilitation settings. However, a weak recommendation for patients with stable COPD was implicated in the quantitative synthesis. Further research would be required to explore the best indications for this self-monitoring approach. Systematic Review Registration: CRD 42020157695."

In sleep apnoea, a putative link between intermittent hypoxia and hypertension is the generation of oxygen radicals by angiotensin II and xanthine oxidase within the chemoreflex arc and vasculature. We tested whether chemoreflex control of sympathetic outflow, hypoxic vasodilatation and blood pressure are altered by angiotensin blockade (losartan) and/or xanthine oxidase inhibition (allopurinol). What is the main finding and its importance? Both drugs lowered blood pressure without altering sympathetic outflow, reducing chemoreflex sensitivity or enhancing hypoxic vasodilatation. Losartan and allopurinol are effective therapies for achieving blood pressure control in sleep apnoea.\n    \n\n\n          Abstract:\n        \n      \n      Chemoreflex sensitization produced by chronic intermittent hypoxia in rats is attenuated by angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1 R) blockade. Both AT1 R blockade and xanthine oxidase inhibition ameliorate chronic intermittent hypoxia-induced endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesized that treatment with losartan and allopurinol would reduce chemoreflex sensitivity and improve hypoxic vasodilatation in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. Eighty-six hypertensive patients with apnoea-hypopnoea index ≥25 events h-1 and no other cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal or metabolic disease were randomly assigned to receive allopurinol, losartan or placebo for 6 weeks. Treatment with other medications and/or continuous positive airway pressure remained unchanged. Tests of chemoreflex sensitivity and hypoxic vasodilatation were performed during wakefulness before and after treatment. Ventilation (pneumotachography), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (microneurography), heart rate (electrocardiography), arterial oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry), blood pressure (sphygmomanometry), forearm blood flow (venous occlusion plethysmography) and cerebral flow velocity (transcranial Doppler ultrasound) were measured during eupnoeic breathing and graded reductions in inspired O2 tension. Losartan and allopurinol lowered arterial pressure measured during eupnoeic breathing and exposure to acute hypoxia. Neither drug altered the slopes of ventilatory, sympathetic or cardiovascular responses to acute hypoxia. We conclude that losartan and allopurinol are viable pharmacotherapeutic adjuncts for achieving blood pressure control in hypertensive obstructive sleep apnoea patients, even those who are adequately treated with continuous positive airway pressure."

Higher functional social support (MOSSS total score) was associated with marginally lower odds of smoking (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98-1.00; P = 0.03) and higher odds of pneumococcal vaccination (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.03; P = 0.02). Social support was not associated with influenza vaccination or medication adherence.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Structural social support, which was measured by reports of living with others and having a caregiver, was respectively associated with higher levels of physical activity and greater participation in pulmonary rehabilitation in adults with COPD.

            "abstract": "Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) has become standard care for the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other severe hypoxemic lung diseases. The use of new portable O2 concentrators (POC) in LTOT is being expanded. However, the issue of oxygen titration is not always properly addressed, since POCs rely on proper use by patients. The robustness of algorithms and the limited reliability of current oximetry sensors are hindering the effectiveness of new approaches to closed-loop POCs based on the feedback of blood oxygen saturation. In this study, a novel intelligent portable oxygen concentrator (iPOC) is described. The presented iPOC is capable of adjusting the O2 flow automatically by real-time classifying the intensity of a patient's physical activity (PA). It was designed with a group of patients with COPD and stable chronic respiratory failure. The technical pilot test showed a weighted accuracy of 91.1% in updating the O2 flow automatically according to medical prescriptions, and a general improvement in oxygenation compared to conventional POCs. In addition, the usability achieved was high, which indicated a significant degree of user satisfaction. This iPOC may have important benefits, including improved oxygenation, increased compliance with therapy recommendations, and the promotion of PA."

Of 560 eligible patients identified, 279 (50%) declined to participate. The remaining patients were equally randomized to either TM (n=141) or usual care (n=140) for the 6-month study period. TM comprised recording of symptoms, saturation, spirometry, and weekly video consultations. Algorithms generated alerts if readings breached thresholds. Both groups received standard care.

No difference in drop-out rate and mortality was found between the groups. With regard to the primary outcome, no significant difference was found in hospital admissions for COPD between the groups (P=0.74), and likewise, no difference was found in time to first admission or all-cause hospital admissions.

            "abstract": "We investigated the influence of head-dependent positions upon functional residual capacity (FRC) and arterial oxygen saturation in 25 patients with clinically stable chronic air-flow obstruction and 25 normal subjects. Lung volume was measured by gas dilution in normal subjects and by plethysmography in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Arterial oxygen saturation was determined by ear oximetry. In normal subjects, sitting FRC declined by 29.9% when a horizontal-supine posture was assumed, but underwent little further change as the supine subject was tilted head-downward to -25 degrees. Lateral decubitus positions caused declines from sitting FRC of 17.1% at 0 degrees, and 27.4% at -25 degrees. In contrast, patients with COPD experienced negligible changes in lung volume as position was varied. The mean falls from sitting FRC were 3.5% and 1.9% in the 0 degree supine and 0 degree lateral decubitus postures, respectively, and little further volume loss occurred in head-dependency. Eight patients actually increased FRC when recumbent. Positional lung volume changes measured by gas dilution exceeded those measured by plethysmography, suggesting that increased air trapping helped to maintain FRC as position was altered. Patients with COPD did not desaturate in any position tested. We conclude that patients with advanced COPD conserve lung volume and do not desaturate when tipped into head-dependent positions. Reduction of FRC is unlikely to contribute to the hypoxemia or dyspnea previously reported to occur in these patients during chest physiotherapy."

We evaluate six machine learning methods to obtain gait speed during natural walking training models to predict natural walking speed and distance during a 6MWT with 28 pulmonary patients and ten subjects without pulmonary condition. We also compare our model's accuracy to popular fitness devices. Our universally trained support vector machine models produce 6MWT distance with 3.23% error during a controlled 6MWT and 11.2% during natural free walking. Furthermore, our model attains 7.9% error when tested on five subjects for distance estimation compared to the 50-400% error seen in fitness devices during natural walking."

            "abstract": "Introduction and objectives:\n        \n      \n      There are various recommendations for physical activity (PA). However agreement between all of these measures has not been established. Furthermore, given the challenges of measuring PA there is interest in evaluating whether a measure of exercise performance can be used as a surrogate measure to identify who is likely to achieve the recommendations.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 184 people with COPD were recruited, 128 of which had complete data for these analyses. Participants wore the SenseWear Armband for 7 consecutive days and all performed an incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT). We extracted moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in bouts of ≥10 min using a 3 metabolic equivalent (MET) threshold and an individually prescribed MET threshold (based on performance on the ISWT). Average daily step count and the physical activity level were also calculated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was poor agreement between the four PA recommendations, with agreement on all four achieved in only 30 participants. People were least likely to be active using MVPA in ≥10 min bouts using 3 MET threshold (21.1% active), and most likely to be active using MVPA in ≥10 min bouts using an individually prescribed threshold (64.9% active). It was not possible to identify a threshold on the ISWT that would reliably predict those that achieved any of the four recommendations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Agreement between various physical activity recommendations is poor. This should be considered when measuring and describing physical activity adherence. The ISWT cannot be used to reliably predict adherence to physical activity guidelines."

Significant systemic arterial oxygen desaturation was observed after Valsalva in 45% of patients with interatrial PFO shunting and severe COPD. This significantly correlated with the degree of pulmonary hypertension (r = 0.6; P <.05).

Combined Sp,O2 and Pc,CO2 were measured at the ear lobe in 114 patients. In four patients, the ear-clip slipped and they were excluded. In total, 11 patients had artefacts with Sp,O2 recordings, thus, Sp,O2 was analysed in 99 patients. Spirometry data were available in 77 patients. Multivariate analysis of covariance and logistic regression were used for statistical analyses. Mean baseline Pc,CO2 was 4.78+/-1.06 kPa (36+/-8 mmHg) and mean rise in the Pc,CO2 during bronchoscopy was 1.26+/-0.70 kPa (9.5+/-5.3 mmHg), while mean Pc,CO2 at the end of bronchoscopy was 5.85+/-1.19 kPa (44+/-9 mmHg) . Baseline Pc,CO2 and the lowest Sp,O2 were significantly associated with peak Pc,CO2 and the change in Pc,CO2 during bronchoscopy. Risk of significant hypoxaemia (Sp,O2<or=90%) was lower for a higher baseline Sp,O2. Peak Pc,CO2 was directly associated with significant hypoxaemia. There was no significant association in the baseline Pc,CO2, peak Pc,CO2, baseline Sp,O2 or the lowest Sp,O2 comparing patients with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

We simultaneously compared Nellcor N-395 (Oxismart XLTM) pulse oximeters with an RS-10 forehead sensor (RS-10), a D-25 digit sensor (D-25), and the Ivy 2000 (Masimo SETTM)/LNOP-Adt digit sensor (Ivy) to arterial blood oxygen saturation (Sa(O(2))) by cooximetry. Nine normal subjects, six athletes, and four patients with chronic disease exercised to maximum oxygen consumption (VO(2 max)) under various conditions [normoxia, hypoxia inspired oxygen fraction (FI(O(2))) = 0.125; hyperoxia, FI(O(2)) = 1.0]. Regression analysis for normoxia and hypoxic data was performed (n = 161 observations, Sa(O(2)) = 73-99.9%), and bias (B) and precision (P) were calculated. RS10 offered greater validity than the other two devices tested (y = 1.009x - 0.52, R(2) = 0.90, B+/-P = 0.3 +/- 2.5). Finger sensors had low precision and a significant negative bias (D-25: y = 1.004x - 2.327, R(2) = 0.52, B+/-P = -2.0 +/- 7.3; Ivy: y = 1.237x - 24.2, R(2) = 0.78, B+/-P = -2.0 +/- 5.2). Eliminating measurements in which heart rate differed by >10 beats/min from the electrocardiogram value improved precision minimally and did not affect bias substantially (B+/-P = 0.5 +/- 2.0, -1.8 +/- 8.4, and -1.25+/-4.33 for RS-10, D-25, and Ivy, respectively). Signal detection algorithms and pulse oximeter were identical between RS-10 and D-25; thus the improved performance of the forehead sensor is likely because of sensor location. RS-10 should be considered for exercise testing in which pulse oximetry is desirable."

Comparison of multiple parameters between COPD patients with and without a PFO during VM did not reveal any clinically significant differences. When we compared COPD patients with and without a PFO during resting, however, we found that the former had longer durations of disease, lower PaO2 and SaO2, higher dyspnea scores, shorter distances walked during 6 MWT and higher desaturation rates (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that longer duration of disease, lower SaO2 and higher systolic pulmonary artery pressure were independent predictors of the occurrence of a PFO in resting COPD patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of a PFO is higher in patients with COPD than in healthy individuals.

The causes of exercise intolerance are incompletely understood.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to objectively assess cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity, evaluate causes of exercise intolerance, and explore clinical factors associated with cardiorespiratory fitness after bilateral LTx (BLTx).\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Peak oxygen uptake (V∙O2peak) and exercise-limiting factors were evaluated by a treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) 6-60 months after BLTx. Physical activity was measured with accelerometers, and results were compared with Norwegian normative data and the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations for physical activity.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In 54 included BLTx recipients (mean age 50 ± 15 years, 50% females), V∙O2peak (mL × kg-1 × min-1) was 21.8 ± 7.7 for men and 22.4 ± 6.2 for women, corresponding to 57 ± 17 and 70 ± 12% of predicted, respectively. Three patients (6%) met criteria for normal V∙O2peak. Deconditioning limited V∙O2peak in 22 patients (41%), while ventilatory limitation and abnormal gas exchange were observed in 14 (26%) and 20 (37%) patients, respectively (some had more than 1 finding). Forty-three patients (86%) did not meet the WHO physical activity recommendations. There was a moderate correlation between V∙O2peak and physical activity (r = 0.642, p < 0.01). Body mass index, physical activity, forced expiratory volume after 1 second, sex, and hemoglobin together accounted for 73% of the variability in V∙O2peak.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Low cardiorespiratory fitness was observed in the majority of BLTx recipients. Both deconditioning and cardiopulmonary limitations were common findings. Nearly 90% were classified as being inactive according to physical activity recommendations. CPET appears to identify a deconditioned subgroup of BLTx recipients for whom exercise training may be especially beneficial."

            "abstract": "Background: Pulmonary rehabilitation programs improve dyspnea and health status associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but benefits wane when patients return to a sedentary lifestyle. This study tested a simple, low-resource, low-cost home walking program. Methods: In this single center, 3-month study, 115 COPD patients were randomized to a control cohort or a goal setting cohort. Each patient met with study staff and received 5 telephone calls at 2-week intervals. During these contacts, the Goal group was assisted by a wellness coach who helped them set personal activity goals. All patients wore a pedometer to record daily steps, the primary study outcome. Results: Over the 12-week interval, the average step-per-days was 36% higher for the Goal cohort patients (Week 12 mean = 4390) than for Control patients (mean = 3790). No group differences emerged on the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, the COPD Assessment Test, or the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire. Secondary analyses indicated that even patients with greater disease severity, including those with an mMRC score >2 or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) % predicted below 50%, increased their walking relative to Control patients. Almost half (48%) of Goal patients successfully reached at least one personal goal such as increasing stamina and activity, or decreasing shortness of breath or weight. Conclusions: A relatively low-resource wellness coaching, goal-setting intervention resulted in a small improvement in the activity level of COPD patients over a 12-week period including those with marked pulmonary impairment. Further investigation should be directed at understanding the optimal blend of in person and remote coaching needed to produce the greatest cost-to-benefit ratio."

Also, it may help increase adherence to PA programs. There are reliable objective and subjective methods available to measure PA. Recently, several new monitors have been developed that have improved accuracy of such measurements. Because these devices provide real-time feedback, they may help to improve participant self-motivation strategies and reinforce daily lifestyle modifications, one of the main goals in COPD management. This review focuses on describing available instruments to measure PA, specifically in patients with COPD.

We conclude from the available evidence that the SpO2 target of 92-96% may be preferable to 94-98%."

            "title": "Effect of High-Flow Oxygen on Exercise Performance in COPD Patients. Randomized Trial.",
            "abstract": "Background: High-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT) provides oxygen-enriched, humidified, and heated air at high flow rates via nasal cannula. It could be an alternative to low-flow oxygen therapy (LFOT) which is commonly used by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during exercise training. Research Question: We evaluated the hypothesis that HFOT improves exercise endurance in COPD patients compared to LFOT. Methods: Patients with stable COPD, FEV1 40-80% predicted, resting pulse oximetry (SpO2) ≥92%, performed two constant-load cycling exercise tests to exhaustion at 75% of maximal work rate on two different days, using LFOT (3 L/min) and HFOT (60 L/min, FiO2 0.45) in randomized order according to a crossover design. Primary outcome was exercise endurance time, further outcomes were SpO2, breath rate and dyspnea. Results: In 79 randomized patients, mean ± SD age 58 ± 9 y, FEV1 63 ± 9% predicted, GOLD grades 2-3, resting PaO2 9.4 ± 1.0 kPa, intention-to-treat analysis revealed an endurance time of 688 ± 463 s with LFOT and 773 ± 471 s with HFOT, mean difference 85 s (95% CI: 7 to 164, P = 0.034), relative increase of 13% (95% CI: 1 to 28). At isotime, patients had lower respiratory rate and higher SpO2 with HFOT. At end-exercise, SpO2 was higher by 2% (95% CI: 2 to 2), and Borg CR10 dyspnea scores were lower by 0.8 points (95% CI: 0.3 to 1.2) compared to LFOT. Interpretation: In mildly hypoxemic patients with COPD, HFOT improved endurance time in association with higher arterial oxygen saturation, reduced respiratory rate and less dyspnea compared to LFOT. Therefore, HFOT is promising for enhancing exercise performance in COPD. Clinical Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT03955770."

            "abstract": "Dyspnea is a symptom arising from a complex interplay of diseases and physiologic states and is commonly encountered in primary care. It is considered chronic if present for more than one month. As a symptom, dyspnea is a predictor for all-cause mortality. The likeliest causes of dyspnea are disease states involving the cardiac or pulmonary systems such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, pneumonia, and coronary artery disease. A detailed history and physical examination should begin the workup; results should drive testing. Approaching testing in stages beginning with first-line tests, including a complete blood count, basic chemistry panel, electrocardiography, chest radiography, spirometry, and pulse oximetry, is recommended. If no cause is identified, second-line noninvasive testing such as echocardiography, cardiac stress tests, pulmonary function tests, and computed tomography scan of the lungs is suggested. Final options include more invasive tests that should be done in collaboration with specialty help. There are three main treatment and management goals: correctly identify the underlying disease process and treat appropriately, optimize recovery, and improve the dyspnea symptoms. The six-minute walk test can be helpful in measuring the effect of ongoing intervention. Care of patients with chronic dyspnea typically requires a multidisciplinary approach, which makes the primary care physician ideal for management."

Twenty-two COPD patients utilizing long-term oxygen recruited from 5 sites of the COPD Clinical Research Network wore a triaxial accelerometer (RT3, Stayhealthy, Monrovia, CA) during waking hours over a 14-day period. Computerized algorithms were composed allowing minute-by-minute activity data to be analyzed to determine, for each minute, whether the monitor was being worn. Temporal alignment allowed determination of average time course of activity level, expressed as average vector magnitude units (VMU, the vectorial sum of activity counts in three orthogonal directions) per minute, for each hour of the day. Mid-day activity was quantified as average VMU/minute between 10AM and 4PM for minutes the monitor was worn. Over the 14 day monitoring period, subjects wore the monitor an average of 11.4 +/- 3.0 hours x day(-1). During mid-day hours, subjects wore the monitor 76.3% of the time and generated an average activity level of 112 +/- 55 VMU x min(-1). Increase in precision of activity estimates with longer monitoring periods was demonstrated. This analysis scheme allows a detailed temporal pattern of activity to be defined from triaxial accelerometer recordings and has the potential to facilitate comparisons among subjects and between subject groups.

Heart rate (HR) and dyspnea were measured each minute throughout the tests, and pulse oximetric saturation (Spo(2)) was measured before and immediately after each test.

This strategy is not possible in an externally paced ISWT or CET. However, it is a limited strategy, with performance converging at higher workloads. Similar peak exercise responses were achieved in the 6MWT, ISWT, and CET. Greater oxygen desaturation was observed during the field walking tests, suggesting that both the ISWT and 6MWT are more sensitive than the CET in detecting exercise-induced hypoxemia and in assessing ambulatory oxygen therapy needs."

Oxygen saturation (SaO2) was measured by ear-lobe oximetry and ventilation (VE) by inductance plethysmography. Radionuclide ventilation images of the lungs were obtained using krypton-81m by inhalation and perfusion images using both krypton-81m, by i.v. infusion, and technetium-99m human serum albumin macro-aggregates. The images of ventilation, blood flow and VA/Q ratios were analysed in several ways to see if distributional changes explained the improvement in oxygen saturation. SaO2 improved by 6% and VE was 19% greater after almitrine than after placebo. There was no significant change in the distribution of ventilation, perfusion or VA/Q between any of 10 horizontal slices through the left lung. The average position of ventilation distribution was shifted towards the top of the lung compared to placebo (p less than 0.05). No significant changes in distribution of perfusion were observed. We conclude that almitrine is not associated with any change in the inter-regional distribution of perfusion, but may have a slight effect on the distribution of ventilation."

The pulmonary function test, COPD assessment test, 6-min walk distance and parameters of physical activity were significantly improved (P<0.05) by combination therapy under smart watch-based coaching compared with values prior to treatment. To the best of our knowledge, the present study for the first time provides evidence that smart watch-based coaching in combination with tiotropium and olodaterol may improve daily physical activity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

Physical activity was measured by a uniaxial accelerometer, exercise performance by the Incremental Shuttle Walking Test (ISWT), and health status by the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire-Self Reported. Patients who commenced PR in the winter had lower levels of physical activity at baseline (P = .02) and attained the largest improvements when compared with any other seasonal group (P = .04). No seasonal variation was detected in ISWT scores or health status either prior to or upon completion of PR.

Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a well-known adjunctive treatment for pain management, wound healing, lymphedema, and cellulitis. PBMT uses light to start a cascade of photochemical reactions that lead to local and systemic anti-inflammatory effects at multiple levels and that stimulate healing. Numerous empirical studies of PBMT for patients with pulmonary disease such as pneumonia, COPD and asthma suggest that PBMT is a safe and effective adjunctive treatment. Recent systematic reviews suggest that PBMT may be applied to target lung tissue in COVID-19 patients. In this preliminary study, we evaluated the effect of adjunctive PBMT on COVID-19 pneumonia and patient clinical status.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      We present a small-scale clinical trial with 10 patients randomized to standard medical care or standard medical care plus adjunctive PBMT.

Analyzed variables were age, pulmonary function, mean number of total and aerobic steps per day, walked distance and mean daily time of aerobic activity. Activity variables were analyzed individually and as a new differential variable DELTA. Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney nonparametric tests were used for comparison between groups. General series data: 19 male. Age: 63+/-10.9 years. FEV(1)%: 88.4+/-22.7. DLCO: 86.2+/-21.6. Eleven cases had COPD criteria. Type of surgery: 3 pneumonectomy/18 lobectomy. Activity data: all patients showed a global decrease of their activity one month after surgery but, patients in the pneumonectomy group are unable to keep aerobic activity meanwhile patients that undergone lobectomy showed only a 25% reduction in the measured variables. Major pulmonary resection decreases the time and the quality of the daily ambulatory activity of the patients during the first postoperative month. Despite limitations, the chosen pedometer OMRON Walking Style Pro is an efficient tool to evaluate the perioperative daily ambulatory activity of patients."

Unlike pulmonary function testing, the 6MWT captures the often coexisting extrapulmonary manifestations of chronic respiratory disease, including cardiovascular disease, frailty, sarcopenia, and cancer. In contrast with cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing, this test does not require complex equipment or technical expertise. In this low complexity, safe test, the patient is asked to walk as far as possible along a 30-m minimally trafficked corridor for a period of 6 min with the primary outcome measure being the 6-min walk distance (6MWD) measured in meters. There has been interest in other derived indexes, such as distance-desaturation product (the product of nadir oxygen saturation and walk distance), which in small studies has been predictive of morbidity and mortality in certain chronic respiratory conditions. Special attention to methodology is required to produce reliable and reproducible results. Factors that can affect walk distance include track layout (continuous vs straight), track length, oxygen amount and portability, learning effect, and verbal encouragement. The absolute 6MWD and change in 6MWD are predictive of morbidity and mortality in patients with COPD, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and patients awaiting lung transplant, highlighting its use in management decisions and clinical trials. As of January 2018, Current Procedural Terminology code 94620 (simple pulmonary stress test) has been deleted and replaced by two new codes, 94617 and 94618.

A noninvasive approach (AGM100), allowing the calculation of PaO2 (cPaO2) derived from pulse oximetry (SpO2), has been developed, but this has not been validated in a large cohort of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Our aim was to conduct a validation study of the AG100 in hypoxemic moderate-to-severe COPD. Concurrent measurements of cPaO2 (AGM100) and mPaO2 (EPOC, portable aBGA device) were performed in 131 moderate-to-severe COPD patients (mean ±SD FEV1: 60 ± 10% of predicted value) and low-altitude residents, becoming hypoxemic (i.e., SpO2 < 94%) during a short stay at 3100 m (Too-Ashu, Kyrgyzstan). Agreements between cPaO2 (AGM100) and mPaO2 (EPOC) and between the O2-deficit (calculated as the difference between end-tidal pressure of O2 and cPaO2 by the AGM100) and Riley A-aDO2 were assessed. Mean bias (±SD) between cPaO2 and mPaO2 was 2.0 ± 4.6 mmHg (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.2 to 2.8 mmHg) with 95% limits of agreement (LoA): -7.1 to 11.1 mmHg. In multivariable analysis, larger body mass index (p = 0.046), an increase in SpO2 (p < 0.001), and an increase in PaCO2-PETCO2 difference (p < 0.001) were associated with imprecision (i.e., the discrepancy between cPaO2 and mPaO2). The positive predictive value of cPaO2 to detect severe hypoxemia (i.e., PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg) was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.87 to 0.98) with a positive likelihood ratio of 3.77 (95% CI: 1.71 to 8.33). The mean bias between O2-deficit and A-aDO2 was 6.2 ± 5.5 mmHg (95% CI: 5.3 to 7.2 mmHg; 95%LoA: -4.5 to 17.0 mmHg). AGM100 provided an accurate estimate of PaO2 in hypoxemic patients with COPD, but the precision for individual values was modest.

The general guidelines that qualify a patient for long-term home oxygen therapy are rather explicit, although there are some gray areas, such as increasing exercise performance in normoxemic COPD patients and the treatment of dyspnea in certain patients. The physiologic goals of oxygen therapy are to reverse or prevent tissue hypoxia under the various conditions of life. Patients often experience a fall in oxygen saturation during REM sleep and during exercise. Thus, the oxygen prescription should specify the oxygen setting during wakeful rest, sleep, and exertion. Pulmonary rehabilitation is the definitive long-term management for patients with chronic lung diseases by building endurance, strength, and coping skills. Patients undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation are taught to become active and mobile. The rehabilitation programs have a special role in helping patients to accept and properly administer their own oxygen therapy. Oxygen therapy should be based on mobility and portability. Improvements in the weight and bulk of oxygen containers and the introduction of oxygen-conserving devices have rendered oxygen systems more portable and less costly. The prescription initiates a clinical triad relationship between the patient, physician, and home oxygen vendor. Prescribing home oxygen is now more time-consuming, and the prescription process requires the careful attention of the physician. The prescription must include patient data, the diagnostic reasons for oxygen, the blood gases, the type of system, and the liter-flow for the various living conditions such as rest, sleep, and exertion. Reimbursement for oxygen via Medicare and other carriers will depend upon the physiologic data as well as the successful completion of a rather complex form. Oxygen therapy should be monitored by regular arterial blood gases or pulse oximetry where appropriate. Patients should have a blood gas sample taken upon any change of condition or adjustment of the oxygen flow setting. Successful oxygen therapy should be physician directed, based on a solid understanding of the physiologic processes involved."

            "abstract": "This study applies a cluster analysis to identify typical physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour (SB) patterns in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) before starting pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). We implemented an observational design which assessed baseline data of objectively measured PA and SB from the STAR (Stay Active after Rehabilitation) study. A total of 355 persons wore an accelerometer (Actigraph wGT3X) for seven days before the start of their PR. Sociodemographic and disease-related parameters were assessed at the start of PR. We applied cluster analysis and compared clusters applying univariate variance analyses. Data was available for 326 persons (31.6% women; age ø = 58 years). Cluster analysis revealed four movement clusters with distinct PA and SB patterns: Sedentary non-movers (28.5%), sedentary occasional movers (41.7%), sedentary movers (19.6%), and sedentary exercisers (10.1%). The four clusters displayed varying levels of moderate PA before rehabilitation (Ø daily min: 9; 28; 38; 70). Notably, all four clusters displayed considerably long average sedentary time per day (Ø daily minutes: 644; 561; 490; 446). The clusters differed significantly in disease-related parameters of GOLD severity, FEV1, CAT, and 6-Min-Walk-Test. In addition to PA promotion, PR programs should consider the reduction of sedentary behaviour as a valuable goal."

Quantification of accelerometer derived impacts associated with competitive games in National Collegiate Athletic Association division I college football players. J Strength Cond Res 31(2): 330-338, 2017-The aims of the present study were to (a) examine positional impact profiles of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) division I college football players using global positioning system (GPS) and integrated accelerometry (IA) technology and (b) determine if positional differences in impact profiles during competition exist within offensive and defensive teams. Thirty-three NCAA division I Football Bowl Subdivision players were monitored using GPS and IA (GPSports) during 12 regular season games throughout the 2014 season. Individual player data sets (n = 294) were divided into offensive and defensive teams, and positional subgroups. The intensity, number, and distribution of impact forces experienced by players during competition were recorded. Positional differences were found for the distribution of impacts within offensive and defensive teams. Wide receivers sustained more very light and light to moderate (5-6.5 G force) impacts than other position groups, whereas the running backs were involved in more severe (>10 G force) impacts than all offensive position groups, with the exception of the quarterbacks (p ≤ 0.05). The defensive back and linebacker groups were subject to more very light (5.0-6.0 G force) impacts, and the defensive tackle group sustained more heavy and very heavy (7.1-10 G force) impacts than other defensive positions (p ≤ 0.05). Data from the present study provide novel quantification of positional impact profiles related to the physical demands of college football games and highlight the need for position-specific monitoring and training in the preparation for the impact loads experienced during NCAA division I football competition."

However, the effect of SABA on physical activity (PA) is unclear.Objective: This study aimed to determine whether assistive use of SABA increases PA and whether additional pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) can aid further improvement.Methods: Twelve outpatients with COPD and dyspnea during daily activities despite regular use of long-acting bronchodilators were enrolled. This study comprised a 2-week pre-intervention investigation, a 12-week investigation of SABA effects, and an 8-week investigation of the additional effects of PR. Assistive use of SABA was allowed up to 4 times per day after the pre-intervention period. PA was measured for 14 consecutive days using an accelerometer sensor. Dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and HRQOL were evaluated at entry, at 4 and 12 weeks after initiating SABA use, and after completing PR.Results: Assistive use of SABA improved breathlessness during daily activities and increased PA (p < .001). PA and HRQOL were also improved following PR (p < .001 and p = .013, respectively).Conclusions: Combined therapy of SABA and PR can increase PA and HRQOL in COPD patients."

Telemonitoring cut total costs by 895 € (p < 0.05) compared to COPD standard care, mainly driven by savings in COPD-related hospitalisations in (very) severe COPD patients (-1056 €, p < 0.0001). Telemonitoring enrolees used healthcare (all-cause and COPD-related) less intensely with shorter hospital stays, fewer inpatient stays and smaller proportions of people with emergency department visits and hospitalisations (all p < 0.0001).

Furthermore, we found that the slope of the evolution of the MMG amplitude parameters, as the load increases during the respiratory test, has positive correlation with the %FEV1/FVC pulmonary function test parameter of the six COPD patients analyzed (RMS, left: 0.38 - right: 0.41; Rényi entropy, left: 0.45 - right: 0.63; Multistate Lempel-Ziv, left: 0.39 - right: 0.64).

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      In the context that special weaning units have been advocated as effective alternatives to the ICU for weaning selected patients, we initiated a Respiratory Special Care Unit (ReSCU) at the Cleveland Clinic Hospital in August 1993. The goals of the ReSCU were the following: (1) to wean ventilator-dependent patients when possible; and (2) when weaning was not possible, to optimize patient and family instruction for patients going home with ventilatory support. This study presents our 4-year experience with 212 patients managed in the ReSCU and analyzes clinical features associated with favorable clinical outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The features of the ReSCU include six private beds in a pulmonary inpatient ward staffed by nurses with special pulmonary expertise; 24-h respiratory therapy supervision; bedside and central noninvasive monitoring (i.e., continuous pulse oximetry, end tidal capnometry, and ventilator alarms); and a multidisciplinary approach involving dietitians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, social workers, and speech pathologists. All ReSCU patients were cared for primarily by a pulmonary/critical care attending physician and fellow, with consultative input solicited as deemed necessary. The criteria for admission to the ReSCU included hemodynamic stability; absence of an arrhythmia requiring telemetry; and in the attending physician's judgment, the ability to benefit from the ReSCU.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Between August 23, 1993, and August 31, 1997, 212 patients were admitted to the ReSCU. The median age was 68 years old; 55% were women; 86% were white; and 55% were transferred from the medical ICU. Underlying reasons for ventilator dependence were ARDS from a nonsurgical cause (33%), ARDS following surgery (18%), status post-cardiothoracic surgery (13%), status post-thoracic surgery (12%), and COPD (12%). The median length of ReSCU stay was 17 days (interquartile range, 10 to 29 days). Eighteen percent (n = 38) died during the hospitalization. Among the 174 survivors, complete ventilator independence was achieved in 127 patients (60% of the 212 patient cohort), 28 patients were ventilator dependent (13% of 212 patients), and the remaining 19 patients (9%) required partial ventilatory support. Univariate analysis regarding the association of baseline characteristics with death identified lower albumin and transferrin levels, increasing age, and the physician's estimate of lower weaning likelihood as significant correlates of death. In contrast, achieving complete ventilator independence was associated with a higher serum albumin level, a nonmedical ICU referral source, a cause of respiratory failure other than COPD, and a physician's estimate of higher weaning likelihood. To analyze the financial impact of the ReSCU, we assumed that ReSCU patients would have otherwise stayed in the medical ICU and compared the charges (ICU vs ReSCU) with, for a subset of patients, the true costs of ReSCU vs. ICU care. Analyses of both charges and cost differences showed similar savings associated with ReSCU care ($13,339 per patient [charges] and $10,694 per patient [costs]).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We conclude the following: (1) the rate of achieving complete ventilator independence in the ReSCU was high; and (2) based on our achieving clinical outcomes, which are comparable to the most favorable rates reported in other series from ventilator units, we conclude that the ReSCU can be an effective and cost-saving alternative to the ICU for carefully selected patients."

A multivariate logistic regression model and a negative binomial regression model were used. A total of 403 patients (55.8% women) had a mean age of 65.0 ± 14.9 years with a mean body mass index of 32.1 ± 11.1 kg/m2. The 28-day mortality was 14.1%, and the intubation rate was 16.1%.

            "abstract": "Cough is a major symptom of respiratory-related diseases. There exists a tremendous amount of work in detecting coughs from audio but there has been no effort to identify coughs from solely inertial measurement unit (IMU). Coughing causes motion across the whole body and especially on the neck and head. Therefore, head motion data during coughing captured by a head-worn IMU sensor could be leveraged to detect coughs using a template matching algorithm. In time series template matching problems, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) combined with elastic distance measurement (esp. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)) achieves outstanding performance. However, it is often regarded as prohibitively time-consuming. Nearest Centroid Classifier is thereafter proposed. But the accuracy is comprised of only one centroid obtained for each class. Centroid-based Classifier performs clustering and averaging for each cluster, but requires manually setting the number of clusters. We propose a novel self-tuning multi-centroid template-matching algorithm, which can automatically adjust the number of clusters to balance accuracy and inference time. Through experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and a real-world earbud-based cough dataset, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm and present the result of cough detection with a single accelerometer sensor on the earbuds platform.Clinical relevance- Coughing is a ubiquitous symptom of pulmonary disease, especially for patients with COPD and asthma.

Compliance with PA monitoring was collected. Two focus groups were conducted to obtain patients' perspectives on the use of activity monitors and on the feedback given. Differences in PA data were also assessed. Sixteen patients (65.63 ± 10.57 years; forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 70.31 ± 22.74% predicted) completed the study. From those, only eleven participants used the activity monitors during all monitoring days. Participants identified several problems regarding the use of activity monitors and monitoring duration. Daily steps (p = 0.026) and standing time (p = 0.030) were improved from week 1 to week 7; however, the former declined from week 7 to week 12. Findings suggest that using feedback to improve PA during PR is feasible and results in improved daily steps and standing time on week 7. The subsequent decline suggests that additional strategies may be needed to stimulate/maintain PA improvements. Further research with more robust designs is needed to investigate the impact of feedback on patients' daily PA.\n"

For an intervention to be classified as telehealth monitoring in this review it must include: a system of collecting data from the patient on health (and/or exercise) outcomes; transmission of the data using technology; interpretation of this data by a healthcare professional and the provision for feedback to the person with COPD (e.g. to alter medication, provide advice, invite the person to attend a consultation with their health care provider).\n    \n\n      \n      This review identified studies that fulfilled the conditions specified in Table 1.

We investigated whether the severity of COPD is associated with the complication of SAHS by examination of nocturnal oximetry as an alternative to polysomnography. Patients with COPD concurrently completed nocturnal oximetry, pulmonary function tests, a COPD assessment test, an Epworth sleepiness scale and a hospital anxiety and depression scale to evaluate the severity of COPD and possible concurrent presence of SAHS.

This study included 103 patients (91 males, 88%) with a mean age of 72 ± 8 years and body mass index of 22 ± 3 kg/m(2). ODI was positively correlated with FEV1, FEV1/FVC and FEV1% predicted, which meant that ODI was inversely correlated with airflow limitation. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that FEV1% predicted and FEV1/FVC were predictors of ODI ≥ 15. ODI is inversely correlated with airflow limitation and milder COPD patients may have co-morbid SAHS."

This study investigated whether continuous vital signs monitoring could predict an AECOPD and readmission.\n## METHODS\n35 people were recruited at discharge following hospitalisation for an AECOPD. Participants were asked to wear an Equivital LifeMonitor during waking hours for 6 weeks and to complete the Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT), a 14-item symptom diary, daily. The Equivital LifeMonitor recorded respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), skin temperature (ST) and physical activity (PA) every 15-s. An AECOPD was classified as mild (by EXACT score), moderate (prescribed oral steroids/antibiotics) or severe (hospitalisation).\n## RESULTS\nOver the 6-week period, 31 participants provided vital signs and symptom data and 14 participants experienced an exacerbation, of which, 11 had sufficient data to predict an AECOPD. HR and PA were associated with EXACT score (p < 0.001). Three days prior to an exacerbation, RR increased by mean ± SD 2.0 ± 0.2 breaths/min for seven out of 11 exacerbations and HR increased by 8.1 ± 0.7 bpm for nine of these 11 exacerbations.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIncreased heart rate and reduced physical activity were associated with worsening symptoms. Even with high-resolution data, the variation in vital signs data remains a challenge for predicting AECOPDs. Respiratory rate and heart rate should be further explored as potential predictors of an impending AECOPD.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nISRCTN registry; ISRCTN12855961.

            "abstract": "Respiratory monitoring in patients receiving oxygen therapy for acute care is mandatory at the initial stage of in-hospital management given the potential risk of clinical worsening. Although some patients benefit from close monitoring in the ICU, the vast majority of them are managed in general wards with reduced staff and clinical supervision. The objective of monitoring is to detect early clinical deterioration, which may help prevent in-hospital cardiac arrest. In addition to the clinical and usual evaluations (eg, breathing frequency, breathing pattern, oximetry, and oxygen flow requirements), early warning scoring systems have been developed to detect clinical deterioration in acutely ill patients. The monitoring of these scores is recommended for patients receiving oxygen therapy. These scores have several limitations, among which is the absence of oxygen flow evaluation. Manual and intermittent monitoring of these scores in the ward is time-consuming and may not be sufficient to accurately detect deterioration of patient's clinical condition in a timely manner. Automated and continuous monitoring, in addition to clinical evaluation and arterial blood gases analysis, which remain necessary, may improve the detection of clinical worsening in specific patients. Devices that automatically titrate and wean oxygen flow on the basis of [Formula: see text] enable measurement of several major cardiorespiratory parameters (eg, [Formula: see text], oxygen flow, heart rate, breathing frequency, and heart rate variability). The combination of these parameters into new scores is at least as accurate and well-evaluated, and recommended early warning scores and may be useful in monitoring patients receiving oxygen therapy."

However, various healthcare and sociological studies show contradicting results regarding the physical and social impact of using such devices. This paper explores real-time user appropriation of an assistive monitoring/tracking device, the pedometer, in a healthcare intervention, with a particular focus on the technology identities users attribute to the pedometer. The study site was a rehabilitation programme at a local Danish health centre supporting patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. As part of this empirical study, six focus-group interviews were conducted with patients before and after they used pedometers. The analysis of respondents' accounts shows that monitoring devices become part of users' complex socio-technical ensembles in which the use of the device and its tracking of activity is constantly negotiated through experimentation with type and frequency of use; interpretation of knowledge and experience gained via the device; and negotiation of expectations, wellbeing, and the value of quantified knowledge for the management of chronic illness. On the basis of these findings the paper brings together and advances sociological scholarship on chronic illness, embodiment, the quantified self and technology adoption."

The between-test end-exercise and isotime values for each cardiorespiratory parameter were not significantly different from each other. With the exception of arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, the repeatability of cardiorespiratory adaptations to ESWT was also confirmed with strong Pearson and intraclass correlation coefficients. Finally, changes of 56-61 s and 70-82 m in endurance time and distance walked, respectively, were perceived by patients.

Herein, our pilot study investigated the chewing ability and degree of desaturation during chewing in patients with COPD (n = 41) and control subjects (n = 22). Subjects chewed a color-changing chewing gum for 1 minute and chewing ability was assessed by the color of the chewed gum, which was scored from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) was monitored using a pulse oximeter and the difference in SpO2 was determined by comparison between before and during chewing. The mean color score of the chewed gum was lower in the COPD group than in the control group (3.1±0.7 vs 4.2±0.9, p<0.0001). Muscle mass loss (p<0.05), <20 remaining teeth (p<0.005), and COPD (p<0.001) were risk factors for poor chewing ability. The mean SpO2 decreased by 0.78±1.46% during gum chewing for 1 min. The mean SpO2 during gum chewing (95.1±2.4%) was lower than before gum chewing (95.9±1.7%) (p<0.05). The reduction of SpO2 was greater in COPD patients who had fewer remaining teeth (p<0.05). COPD patients with SpO2 reduction >4% during the 6-minute walk test showed greater reduction during gum chewing (p<0.05).

However, their lack of accuracy and large individual variability limit their use for evaluation on an individual basis. We evaluated the capacity of the objective measurement of daily physical activity in patients with COPD using accelerometers to estimate their prognostic value.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In 173 consecutive subjects with moderate to very severe COPD, daily physical activity was measured using a triaxial accelerometer providing a mean of 1-min movement epochs as vector magnitude units (VMUs). Patients were evaluated by lung function testing and 6-min walk, incremental exercise, and constant work rate tests. Patients were followed for 5 to 8 years, and the end points were all-cause mortality, hospitalization for COPD exacerbation, and annual declining FEV(1).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After adjusting for relevant confounders, a high VMU decreased the mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.986; 95% CI, 0.981-0.992), and in a multivariate model, comorbidity, endurance time, and VMU were retained as independent predictors of mortality. The time until first admission due to COPD exacerbation was shorter for the patients with lower levels of VMU (adjusted HR, 0.989; 95% CI, 0.983-0.995). Moreover, patients with higher VMU had a lower hospitalization risk than those with a low VMU (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.099; 95% CI, 0.033-0.293). In contrast, VMU was not identified as an independent predictor of the annual FEV(1) decline.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The objective measurement of the daily physical activity in patients with COPD using an accelerometer constitutes an independent prognostic factor for mortality and hospitalization due to severe exacerbation."

            "abstract": "Physical inactivity and sleep disturbance are more problematic in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than in healthy individuals. The purpose of the study was to identify impacts of nighttime sleep on next-day physical activity in COPD patients. The study included 52 COPD patients reporting disturbed sleep. Sleep and physical activity were measured using an accelerometer for 5 days. Increased sleep latency was associated with less next-day physical activity during the afternoon (4-6 p.m.). Greater waking duration/times were associated with less next-morning (6-8 a.m.) physical activity. Greater total sleep time was associated with less next-morning (12-9 a.m.) physical activity, and greater sleep efficiency was associated with less next-morning (1-3 a.m.) and more next-evening (6-7 p.m.) physical activity. Results suggest that sleep disturbance had varying influences on next-day hourly physical activity. These results support the potential value of sleep management in promoting physical activity in COPD patients."

            "abstract": "This essay summarizes 16 reports, published since 1956, that describe the effects of hyperoxia on exercise endurance in persons with COPD who have severe airflow obstruction (ie, FEV(1) < 1.0 L or < 39% of predicted) and mild hypoxemia at rest (ie, PaO(2) > 62 mm Hg or arterial oxygen saturation [SaO(2)] measured by pulse oximetry of > 91%). The term hyperoxia is used because, in a proportion of study participants, oxygen administration increased exercise endurance in a dose-dependent fashion, up to a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.5 or a flow of 100% O(2) of 6 L/min. The process appears to be dependent on an increase in PaO(2) rather than on the restoration of SaO(2) to normal levels. The results of pulmonary function tests were not predictive of response. Increased exercise performance was associated with a decrease in dyspnea, respiratory frequency, and minute ventilation. The slowing of respiratory frequency and the decrease in pulmonary air trapping likely accounted for the decrease in dyspnea. Slowing of the respiratory rate, which occurred at the expense of the retention of CO(2), is most likely due to a hyperoxia-induced decrease in chemoreceptor ventilatory drive from the aortic and carotid bodies. Research is called for to determine the following: (1) the prevalence of COPD patients who have severe airflow limitation accompanied by mild hypoxemia; (2) the proportion of these patients who show improvements in exercise performance during a test of hyperoxic exercise; and (3) whether enhanced exercise performance during a brief test translates into a meaningful increase in the ability to perform the activities of daily living."

Patients often urge the therapeutic use and preventive administration of various medicines, often controlled by studies insufficiently or completely unverified. The aim of the project, commissioned by the Committee of the Society of General Practice of the Czech Medical Association JEP, was to compensate for this deficiency by interdisciplinary consensus and thus provide general practitioners (GPs) with a basic support in accessing patients with COVID-19. Representatives of GPs identified the most common questionable diagnostic or therapeutic approaches and formulated 17 theses, taking into account their own experience, existing Czech and foreign professional recommendations. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method, modified for the needs of pandemic situation, was chosen to seek consensus. Representatives of 7 medical specialties accepted the participation in the 20-member panel. The panel evaluated in 2 rounds, with the comments and opinions of others available to all panelists before the second round. The outcome of the evaluation was agreement on 10 theses addressing the administration of vitamin D, inhaled corticosteroids in patients with COPD and bronchial asthma, acetylsalicylic acid, indications for D-dimer levels examination, preventive administration of LMWH, importance of pulse oximetry, indication for emergency services, indication for antibiotics and rules for distant contact. The panel disagreed on 6 theses recommending the administration of ivermectin, isoprinosine, colchicine and corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 in primary care. One thesis, taking into account the use of D-dimers in primary care was evaluated as uncertain. The most discussed theses, on which there was also no agreement, were outpatient administration of corticosteroids and the importance of elevation of D-dimers levels or their dynamic increase in a symptomatic patient with COVID-19 as an indication for referral to hospital. The results of the consensus identified topics that need to be further discussed and on which it is appropriate to focus further research."

The standard approach to prescribing oxygen uses a static assessment of oxygen requirements in a hospital or clinic setting. The assumption behind this approach is that patients will maintain a \"therapeutic\" hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) in the outpatient setting. We questioned the validity of this assumption, and hypothesized that many patients may demonstrate significant oxygen desaturation during normal activities of daily living. STUDY DESIGN, METHODS, AND MEASUREMENTS: We determined if oxygen supplementation maintained a therapeutic SpO2 level in patients with COPD (n = 27), using the technique of ambulatory oximetry monitoring (AOM). AOM consisted of using a portable oximeter to monitor SpO2, pulse rate, and patient activity while patients were engaged in normal activities of daily living over an extended time period (approximately 18 h). The portable oximeter collected and stored these data every 15 s over the monitored time period. Each AOM recording was manually scored for desaturation events and other key variables, including average SpO2 over the monitoring period, the average number of desaturation events per hour, and the percentage of monitored time deleted secondary to artifacts.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      University-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n    \n\n\n          Patients:\n        \n      \n      All subjects were patients with stable COPD with no recent history of hospitalization or exacerbation of their lung disease.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      This cohort of patients demonstrated a surprising frequency of desaturation below the recommended target SpO2 value (90%), which averaged approximately 25% of AOM recording time. There was wide variability among patients in the percentage of time SpO2 was below the target value (range, 3 to 67% of AOM recording time). Motion artifact on the AOM recordings was not a major problem; an average of 8% of the recording time was deleted secondary to artifacts in this patient cohort.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The results demonstrate that AOM is feasible and accurate with an acceptable level of motion artifact.

One reason for this may be the unavailability to GPs of a measure of arterial oxygenation needed to fulfil the defined prescription criteria. Provision of a non-invasive measure of oxygenation may improve detection of hypoxic subjects and increase appropriate prescribing. This study aimed to evaluate pulse oximetry in a general practice setting and to screen for severe undetected hypoxaemia fulfilling the LTOT prescription criteria in patients with COPD. All COPD patients attending surgery in two practices were screened with oximeters for hypoxaemia. Those with an oxygen saturation of < or = 92% were referred to hospital for formal arterial blood gas analysis and an oxygen concentrator assessment. GPs were asked to evaluate their experience in the ease of use and application of oximetry. The number of patients receiving oxygen by concentrator before the study was compared with the national rate and the number after the study with the estimated need suggested by epidemiological studies. Over a 12-month period a total of 114 patients were screened in the two practices with a combined list size of 15,742. Thirteen patients had saturations of < or = 92%. Two refused and 11 underwent formal arterial gas analysis. Three had PaO2 < 7.3 kPa and new prescriptions for oxygen concentrators were made in these previously unsuspected severely hypoxaemic subjects as a result. One other hypoxaemic subject was referred and found to have another treatable medical condition. The initial prevalence of concentrator prescription (0.013% CI 0.003, 0.047) was similar to the national rate (0.024%) and the prevalence observed after screening (0.031%, CI 0.013, 0.073) fell within the lower suggested prescription need of previous epidemiological data (0.02-0.10%). All practitioners found the oximeters simple to use and helpful in assisting with assessment of the severity of their patient's condition. Oximetry provides a readily usable non-invasive method of screening and when applied to all COPD patients seen in general practice can reveal those fulfilling the criteria for long term oxygen who would otherwise not be identified as needing this treatment."

The primary outcome of physical activity will be measured using a physical activity monitor (Actigraph wGT3X-BT) for a period of 7 days, firstly 2 weeks before rehabilitation begins (t0) as well as 6 weeks and 6 months after rehabilitation (t3, t4). Additionally, to predict physical activity progression after rehabilitation, a complex personal diagnostics battery, including questionnaires as well as functional assessments, is to be carried out at the start and end of rehabilitation (t1, t2). This battery is based on the foundational ideas of the Physical Activity-Related health Competence model. Five hundred and two patients with COPD, aged 18 years or older and admitted for an approved pulmonary rehabilitation, will be enrolled in the STAR study.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The STAR study is designed as a randomized controlled trial to gain a better understanding of the personal determinants of physical activity in patients with COPD and to evaluate a pedometer-based physical activity-change intervention in the context of inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation. The results enable the future identification of patients with COPD who will find it difficult to engage in long-term physical activity after rehabilitation. Based on this, intervention strategies to promote physical activity in the content of pulmonary rehabilitation can be optimized.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Clinicaltrials.gov, ID: NCT02966561 . Registered retrospectively after the start of the recruitment in June 2016 on 22 November 2016. All protocol modifications will be registered in the trial registry."

            "abstract": "Objective: This paper aimed to systematically review the application methods and components of step counter-based physical activity (PA) promotion programs in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The effects of longer-duration (≥12 weeks) programs on PA, exercise capacity, quality of life, and dyspnea were discussed. Methods: This review was performed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Online data resources PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and EBSCO were searched. The publication year was limited between January 2000 to August 2020. All randomized controlled trials with ≥12-week duration of step counter-based PA promotion programs of COPD were included. Two researchers independently assessed the quality of the included studies and extracted their characteristics. Results: Nine studies involving 1,450 participants were included. Step counters, counseling, exercise goals, diaries, and tele-communicational approaches were common components of these programs. The PA feedback tools were mostly pedometers (n = 8), whereas accelerometers were often used as assessment tools of PA (n = 5). All studies implemented counseling: five applied behavioral change theories, and three reported motivational interview techniques simultaneously. Six studies reported detailed exercise goals. The usual exercise goal was to reach a total of 8,000-10,000 steps/day. Three research studies used diaries, and five applied tele-communication approaches to deliver interventions. The programs could be implemented alone (n = 4), in combination with exercise training (n = 2), or with pulmonary rehabilitation (n = 2). All studies showed a significant increase in the PA (≥793 steps/day). Three studies observed a significant improvement in exercise capacity (≥13.4 m), and two reported a significant increase in the quality of life (p < 0.05). No study showed significant between-group differences in dyspnea. Conclusion: There are a few studies assessing the impact of long-duration (≥12 weeks) step counter-based interventions in COPD, with different methodologies, although all studies included counseling and exercise goal setting. These interventions seem to have a positive effect on PA. A few studies also showed benefit on exercise capacity and quality of life."

Hemodynamically unstable patients and those requiring immediate endotracheal intubation were excluded. After an initial arterial blood gas (AGB) analysis was obtained, the patient was placed on BiPAP (Bi-PAP S/T noninvasive ventilator; Respironics, Incorporated) by nose mask or face mask to provide noninvasive pressure support at 5 cm H20. Settings were titrated to patient tolerance and satisfactory pulse oximetry. After at least 30 minutes on a stable setting, arterial blood gases were remeasured. The cause of respiratory distress, vital signs, assessment of need for intubation, arterial blood gas results, and patient disposition were recorded. Success of noninvasive support was defined as the presence of (1) improvement in ABG parameters, (2) clinical improvement and decrease in evident dyspnea, and (3) avoidance of endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Fifty patients were studied.

The platform has important features for monitoring the elderly: unobtrusive, simple, elderly-friendly, plug and play interoperable, and self-integration of sensors. Thirty-six (36) patients in a primary care practice in the United Kingdom (mean [standard deviation] age, 82 [10] years) with congestive heart failure (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were provided with clinical sensors to measure the vital signs for their disease (blood pressure [BP] and weight for CHF, and oxygen saturation for COPD) and one passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor and/or a chair/bed sensor were installed in a patient's home to obtain their activity data. The patients were asked to take one measurement each day of their vital signs in the morning before breakfast. All data were automatically transmitted wirelessly to the remote server and displayed on a clinical portal for clinicians to monitor each patient. An alert algorithm detected outliers in the data and indicated alerts on the portal. Patient data have been analyzed retrospectively following hospital admission, emergency room visit or death, to determine whether the data could predict the event.Results:Data of patients who were monitored for a long period and had interventions were analyzed to identify useful parameters and develop algorithms to define alert rules. Twenty of the 36 participants had a clinical referral during the time of monitoring; 16 of them received some type of intervention. The most common reason for intervention was due to low oxygen levels for patients with COPD and high BP levels for CHF. Activity data were found to contain information on the well-being of patients, in particular for those with COPD. During exacerbation the activity level from PIR sensors increased slightly, and there was a decrease in bed occupancy. One subject with CHF who felt unwell spent most of the day in the bedroom.Conclusions:Our results suggest that integrated care monitoring technologies have a potential for providing improved care and can have positive impact on well-being of the elderly by enabling timely intervention. Long-term BP and pulse oximetry data could indicate exacerbation and lead to effective intervention; physical activity data provided important information on the well-being of patients. However, there remains a need for better understanding of long-term variations in vital signs and activity data to establish intervention protocols for improved disease management."

            "abstract": "A more profound investigation about the responses in activity levels following pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in patients with COPD is needed. We aimed to describe groups of patients with COPD according to patterns of change in physical activity and sedentary behaviour following PR. 90 patients with COPD (60% male; mean age 67 ± 8; median FEV1 47 (32-62) %pred) completed a comprehensive PR programme. A triaxial accelerometer was used to assess the time in sedentary behaviour, light activities and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Additionally, exercise capacity, quality of life, and symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed before and after PR. Six groups with different patterns of change in physical activity and sedentary behaviour were identified. The two most prevalent patterns were represented by good responders (increase in physical activity and reduction in sedentary behaviour, 34%) and poor responders (decrease in physical activity and increase in sedentary behaviour, 30%). Good responders had greater improvements in six-minute walk distance (6MWD) and symptoms of depression than poor responders (P < 0.05 for all). Strong correlation was found between changes in sedentary behaviour and changes in light activities (rs = -0.89; P < 0.0001). Changes in 6MWD correlated fairly with changes in sedentary behaviour (rs = -0.26), light activities (rs = 0.25), and MVPA (rs = 0.24); P < 0.05 for all. Different patterns of change in activity levels following PR can be found in patients with COPD. Focusing on light physical activities might be a potential strategy to make patients less sedentary, but for this to be achieved prior (or at least parallel) improvements in functional capacity seem to be necessary."

The initial phases of the programme focused on whole-genome sequencing of individuals with rich phenotypic data and diverse backgrounds. Here we describe the TOPMed goals and design as well as the available resources and early insights obtained from the sequence data. The resources include a variant browser, a genotype imputation server, and genomic and phenotypic data that are available through dbGaP (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes)1. In the first 53,831 TOPMed samples, we detected more than 400 million single-nucleotide and insertion or deletion variants after alignment with the reference genome. Additional previously undescribed variants were detected through assembly of unmapped reads and customized analysis in highly variable loci. Among the more than 400 million detected variants, 97% have frequencies of less than 1% and 46% are singletons that are present in only one individual (53% among unrelated individuals). These rare variants provide insights into mutational processes and recent human evolutionary history. The extensive catalogue of genetic variation in TOPMed studies provides unique opportunities for exploring the contributions of rare and noncoding sequence variants to phenotypic variation. Furthermore, combining TOPMed haplotypes with modern imputation methods improves the power and reach of genome-wide association studies to include variants down to a frequency of approximately 0.01%."

Additionally, we evaluated whether airflow frequency components in the 0.01 - 0.10 Hz band are linked with desaturations in blood oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) recordings due to apnea events. The relationship between changes in airflow and SaO(2) was analyzed by means of the magnitude squared coherence (MSC) function. Power spectral density (PSD) was used to obtain the power spectrum of single airflow and SaO(2) signals. Peak amplitude (PA) and relative power (P(R)) were used to parameterize the power spectrum in the very low frequency band. 148 subjects suspected of suffering from OSA were studied. Significant differences (p-value ≪ 0.01) between OSA positive and OSA negative subjects were obtained from PSD and MSC features. We found a power increase in the very low frequency band of single-channel airflow linked with the periodic desaturations of OSA. Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 84.0%, 85.4% and 84.5%, respectively, were reached with the peak amplitude of the airflow PSD.

The yoga group received an IAYT module for COPD that included asanas, loosening exercises, breathing practices, pranayama, cyclic meditation, yogic counseling and lectures 90 min/day, 6 days/week for 12 weeks. Measurements of dyspnea and fatigue on the Borg scale, exercise capacity by the 6 min walk test, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2%), and pulse rate (PR) using pulse oximetry were made before and after the intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Statistically significant within group reductions in dyspnea (P < 0.001), fatigue (P < 0.001) scores, PR (P < 0.001), and significant improvements in SpO2% (P < 0.001) and 6 min walk distance (P < 0.001) were observed in the yoga group; all except the last were significant compared to controls (P < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Findings indicate that IAYT benefits coal miners with COPD, reducing dyspnea; fatigue and PR, and improving functional performance and peripheral capillary SpO2%.

            "abstract": "Objective To verify association between left ventricular (LV) mass and thickness and the presence of significant nocturnal hypoxemia in patients with COPD with mild diurnal hypoxemia. Methods A cross-sectional study carried out in clinically stable outpatients with COPD and mild hypoxemia (oxygen saturation ≥90 to ≤94%, identified by noninvasive oximetry) in a clinic specialized in the treatment of respiratory diseases in Goiânia-GO. All patients were submitted to clinical evaluation, spirometry, polysomnography, echocardiography, arterial blood gas analysis, 6-minute walk test and chest X-ray. Results Patients with significant nocturnal hypoxemia had echocardiographic parameters associated with increase of LV musculature when compared to patients with mild nocturnal hypoxemia. The LV volume/mass ratio was significantly lower in the group with significant nocturnal hypoxemia (ratio 0.64 ± 0.13 versus 0.72 ± 0.12, p = 0.04), the thickness diastolic diameter of the interventricular septum and the diastolic thickness of the LV posterior wall were significantly higher in this group (9.7 ± 0.92 versus 9.1 ± 0.90 p = 0.03), (9.7 ± 1.0 versus 8.9 ± 1.0, p = 0.01. The time in REM sleep with saturation below 85% significantly predicted septum thickness (adjustment for BMI, age and mean blood pressure, r2 = 0.20; p = 0.046). Conclusion We observed association between severe REM sleep hypoxemia and echocardiographic parameters indicating increased LV mass in individuals with COPD and significant nocturnal hypoxemia. This suggests that this subgroup of individuals may benefit from an echocardiographic evaluation of the left ventricle."

The only study to examine the effect of modifying track layout performed a retrospective analysis and concluded that institutions using continuous tracks yield greater distances than those using straight tracks.

However, the condition can deteriorate quickly, and some people may develop serious hypoxia with relatively few symptoms. Early identification of deterioration allows effective management with oxygen and steroids. Telemonitoring of symptoms and physiological signs may facilitate this.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to design, implement, and evaluate a telemonitoring system for people with COVID-19 who are self-managing at home and are considered at significant risk of deterioration.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A multidisciplinary team developed a telemonitoring protocol using a commercial platform to record symptoms, pulse oximetry, and temperature. If symptoms or physiological measures breached targets, patients were alerted and asked to phone for an ambulance (red alert) or for advice (amber alert). Patients attending COVID-19 assessment centers, who were considered fit for discharge but at risk of deterioration, were shown how to use a pulse oximeter and the monitoring system, which they were to use twice daily for 2 weeks. Patients could interact with the system via app, SMS, or touch-tone phone. Written guidance on alerts was also provided. Following consent, patient data on telemonitoring usage and alerts were linked to data on the use of service resources. Subsequently, patients who had either used or not used the telemonitoring service, including those who had not followed advice to seek help, agreed to brief telephone interviews to explore their views on, and how they had interacted with, the telemonitoring system. Interviews were recorded and analyzed thematically. Professionals involved in the implementation were sent an online questionnaire asking them about their perceptions of the service.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We investigated the first 116 patients who used the service.

Of the 71 patients who submitted data, 35 (49%) received 152 alerts during their 2-week observation. A total of 67 red alerts were for oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels of ≤93%, and 15 red alerts were because patients recorded severe breathlessness. Out of 71 patients, 14 (20%) were admitted to hospital for an average stay of 3.6 (SD 4.5) days. Of the 45 who used written guidance alone, 7 (16%) were admitted to hospital for an average stay of 4.0 (SD 4.2) days and 1 (2%) died. Some patients who were advised to seek help did not do so, some because parameters improved on retesting and others because they felt no worse than before. All patients found self-monitoring to be reassuring. Of the 11 professionals who used the system, most found it to be useful and easy to use. Of these 11 professionals, 5 (45%) considered the system \"very safe,\" 3 (27%) thought it \"could be safer,\" and 3 (27%) wished to have more experience with it before deciding.

Worryingly, some patients, because they felt well, occasionally ignored important signs of deterioration. It is important, therefore, to emphasize the importance of the early investigation and treatment of asymptomatic hypoxia at the time when patients are initiated and in the warning messages that are sent to patients."

This study aimed to describe a typical day for people with COPD and to explore the differences in time-use patterns across the Body Mass-Index, Airflow Obstruction, Dyspnoea and Exercise Capacity (BODE) index using compositional analyses. Using a cross-sectional design, 141 adults with clinically stable COPD had their demographics, objective measures of function (pulmonary, exercise capacity and physical activity), and self-reported COPD-related impairment recorded. Daily time-use compositions were derived from 24-h accelerometry and 24-h use-of-time recall interviews. Compositional multiple linear regression models were used to explore the relationship between the BODE index and 24-h time-use compositions. These models were used to predict daily time (min/d) that is spent in time-use components across the BODE index. The BODE index score was clearly associated with 24-h accelerometry (p < 0.0001) and 24-h use-of-time recall (p < 0.0001) compositions. Relative to the remaining time-use components, higher BODE index scores were associated with greater sedentary behaviour (p < 0.0001), Quiet time (p < 0.0001), Screen time (p = 0.001) and Self-care (p = 0.022), and less daily Chores (p < 0.0001) and Household administration (p = 0.015) time. As the BODE index scores increased, time-use predictions were strongly associated with decreases in Chores (up to 206 min/d), and increases in Screen (up to 156 min/d) and Quiet time (up to 131 min/d). Time-use patterns may provide a basis for planning interventions relative to the severity of COPD."

Specialized testing such as measurement of respiratory muscle strength and assessment of ventilatory control may also be needed. Genetic testing may help make the diagnosis of some disorders such as the central congenital hypoventilation syndrome. In some patients the first laboratory clue that chronic hypoventilation is present is to note an unexplained elevation in the serum CO (2) (HCO (3)) on routine electrolyte testing. Nocturnal oximetry and polysomnography are usually required to determine if obstructive or central sleep apnea is present in addition to nocturnal hypoventilation. In addition, the severity of daytime hypoventilation or pulmonary function impairment often does not accurately predict the severity of nocturnal changes in arterial oxygen saturation and the degree of nocturnal hypoventilation. End-tidal PCO (2) and transcutaneous PCO (2) are sometimes utilized to directly estimate the degree of nocturnal hypoventilation during sleep studies. They have limitations but may be especially useful to detect trends in the PCO (2) during the night."

Self-reported advanced clinical experience and expert respiratory analysis skills were associated with adjunctive respiratory measure (respiratory rate, pulse oximetry) inclusion during assessment. Compensatory strategy training (77%) is a preferred treatment for dysphagia in COPD; however, respiratory-swallow pattern training and expiratory muscle strength training are increasing in use.

The reduction in ADLs leads to deconditioning which, in turn, further increases dyspnea. Both dyspnea and fatigue are important factors affecting health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The functional status of patients relates to how well they perform ADLs. Activities, however, may not be severely limited until the disease becomes advanced. The elimination of an ADL depends on the necessity or desirability of that activity and the intensity of the associated symptoms. HRQOL is measured using symptoms, functional status, and a rating of their impact on the individual. The Pulmonary Functional Status Scale (PFSS) and the Pulmonary Functional Status and Dyspnea Questionnaire (PFSDQ) are 2 COPD-specific functional status questionnaires. Pedometers or accelerometers can quantify the levels of activity of patients with COPD. HRQOL is measured with validated multidimensional questionnaires that cover symptoms, physical, psychological, and social domains. Ideally, these instruments are discriminative (i.e., separate degrees of impairment) and evaluative (i.e., detect small changes after therapy). HRQOL questionnaires may be generic (e.g., Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 [SF-36]) and can measure favorable changes after intervention, such as pulmonary rehabilitation, or they can be disease specific with disease-related domains, e.g., Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ) with domains of dyspnea, fatigue, emotion, and mastery; and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) with domains of symptoms, activity, and psychosocial impact. A case is presented that depicts how these tools may be used to evaluate improvement with intervention in a patient with COPD."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Dyspnea is the primary symptom limiting exercise in patients with COPD. Recent research has demonstrated that psychological factors can substantially influence the perception of dyspnea, but little is known about the modulation of perceived intensity or unpleasantness of dyspnea by attentional distraction. Therefore, we examined the impact of distractive auditory stimuli on the perception of exercise-induced dyspnea and the affective state in patients with COPD during 6-min walking tests (6MWTs).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty patients with mild-to-severe COPD (mean FEV1, 55.9% predicted) underwent two 6MWTs. Under one exercise condition, distractive auditory stimuli were presented with headphones, while the other condition was performed without auditory distraction. Lung function (FEV1), heart rate (HR), pulse oximetric saturation (SpO2), perceived intensity of dyspnea (ie, visual analog scale for perceived intensity of dyspnea [VAS-I]), and perceived unpleasantness of dyspnea (visual analog scale for perceived unpleasantness of dyspnea [VAS-U]) were measured before and after exercise. In addition, the global level of dyspnea (Borg score), positive affectivity (PA), and negative affectivity were assessed after both conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A similar exercise level during both conditions was confirmed by comparable results in FEV1, HR, SpO2, and distances walked. During auditory distraction, Borg scores and increases in VAS-U were smaller, while PA was higher compared to the nondistraction condition (p<0.05). VAS-I did not show differences across conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Distractive auditory stimuli decrease the global level of exercise-induced dyspnea in patients with COPD by reducing the perceived unpleasantness of dyspnea and lead to an additional increase in PA. Auditory distraction might therefore serve as an intervention for the reduction of dyspnea during exercise in this patient group."

Accuracy was defined as percent step capture, (device step count divided by manual step count) times 100. Predictors of percent step capture were identified using linear regression methods. The accelerometer has an intradevice CV ranging from 0.008 to 0.025 and an interdevice CV of 0.64. In nondisabled males, median percent step capture was 96% (interquartile range 81%-98%). In subjects with COPD, median percent step capture was 86% (interquartile range 72%-96%). Usual walking speed was the most important predictor of percent step capture (p = 0.004). The ActiHealth accelerometer has acceptable intra- and interdevice CVs. It is highly accurate in nondisabled subjects. The accuracy declines in subjects with COPD based on walking speed.

Energy intake was measured with a 7 d food record. Energy expenditure was estimated from a simultaneous 7 d assessment of physical activity with a tri-axial accelerometer for movement registration in combination with measured BMR. Body mass was measured at several time points. The body mass remained stable in both groups after 1 or 3 months and mean energy balances were comparable for both groups. The mean body-mass change between month 1 and 3 was negatively related to the mean physical activity level (r -0.49; P=0.03). Weight change over the 3 months was negatively associated with the physical activity level.

Trending ability was good for a four-quadrant plot analysis with exclusion of the central zone (<10%) [95% confidence interval (CI) for concordance (0.86; 1.00)]. Moderate to good trending ability was observed with a polar plot analysis (angular bias: -7.2°; 95% CI -12.3°; -2.5°; with radial limits of agreement -38°; 24°). After excluding subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a Bland-Altman plot showed a mean bias of 0.47 litre min(-1), limits of agreements between -1.24 and 2.11 litre min(-1), and a percentage error of 35%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      ICG appears to be a reliable method for the non-invasive monitoring of CO in patients undergoing general surgery."

            "abstract": "Rationale:\n        \n      \n      The distance walked in the 6-min walk test (6MWT) predicts mortality in patients with severe COPD. Little is known about its prognostic value in patients with a wider range of COPD severity, living in different countries, and the potential additional impact of oxygen desaturation measured during the test.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We enrolled 576 stable COPD outpatients in Spain and the United States and observed them for at least 3 years (median, 60 months). We measured FEV1, body mass index, Pao2, Charlson comorbidity score, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (Spo2) during the 6MWT. Desaturation was defined as a fall in Spo2 > or = 4% or Spo2 < 90%. Regression analysis helped determine the association between these variables and all-cause and respiratory mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The 6MWD was a good predictor of all-cause and respiratory mortality primarily in patients with FEV1 < 50% of predicted (p < 0.001) after adjusting for all covariates. Patients with desaturation during the 6MWT had a higher mortality rate than patients without desaturation (67% vs 38%, p < 0.001). Oxygen desaturation predicted mortality (relative risk, 2.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.53 to 4.51; p < 0.001) but with less power than Pao2 at rest.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The 6MWD helps predict mortality primarily in patients with severe COPD. Although the oxygen desaturation profile during the 6MWT improves the predictive ability of the 6MWD, it appears to be of less relevance than in other lung diseases and than the resting Pao2."

            "title": "Detecting motor vehicle travel in accelerometer data.",
            "abstract": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) frequently has a significant impact on patients' everyday activity. Because of this, accurate measurement of daily activity is of particular interest. Although accelerometers are an objective means of measuring daily activity, these devices sense vibrations and erroneously score motor vehicle travel (MVT) as moderate physical activity. It is the objective of this study to develop a new method to analyze accelerometry data that would accurately classify MVT as non-acceleration, or sitting/standing. As sitting/standing has a different pattern of count-to-count variability than walking, we hypothesized that a rolling standard deviation (RSD), which is a measurement of volatility in the data, would more accurately classify periods of MVT than analysis based on activity counts alone. Twenty-two subjects with COPD were studied. A training set of 15% of the dataset was used to establish an RSD-threshold during MVT based on the upper 95%-confidence interval. The accuracy of the RSD thresholds were tested and presented as sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating curves. Results demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity suggesting that the RSD not only accurately classified MVT, but had a low rate of misclassification. The RSD analysis scored more MVT as sitting/standing than assessment by VMU alone. The accuracy of accelerometers to define the profile of daily activity in sedentary populations, such as those with COPD, is greatly improved."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The World Health Organization has projected that by 2030, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will be the third-leading cause of mortality and the seventh-leading cause of morbidity worldwide. Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are associated with an accelerated decline in lung function, diminished quality of life, and higher mortality. Accurate early detection of acute exacerbations will enable early management and reduce mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to develop a prediction system using lifestyle data, environmental factors, and patient symptoms for the early detection of AECOPD in the upcoming 7 days.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This prospective study was performed at National Taiwan University Hospital. Patients with COPD that did not have a pacemaker and were not pregnant were invited for enrollment. Data on lifestyle, temperature, humidity, and fine particulate matter were collected using wearable devices (Fitbit Versa), a home air quality-sensing device (EDIMAX Airbox), and a smartphone app. AECOPD episodes were evaluated via standardized questionnaires. With these input features, we evaluated the prediction performance of machine learning models, including random forest, decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis, and adaptive boosting, and a deep neural network model.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The continuous real-time monitoring of lifestyle and indoor environment factors was implemented by integrating home air quality-sensing devices, a smartphone app, and wearable devices. All data from 67 COPD patients were collected prospectively during a mean 4-month follow-up period, resulting in the detection of 25 AECOPD episodes. For 7-day AECOPD prediction, the proposed AECOPD predictive model achieved an accuracy of 92.1%, sensitivity of 94%, and specificity of 90.4%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the area under the curve of the model in predicting AECOPD was greater than 0.9. The most important variables in the model were daily steps walked, stairs climbed, and daily distance moved.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Using wearable devices, home air quality-sensing devices, a smartphone app, and supervised prediction algorithms, we achieved excellent power to predict whether a patient would experience AECOPD within the upcoming 7 days. The AECOPD prediction system provided an effective way to collect lifestyle and environmental data, and yielded reliable predictions of future AECOPD events. Compared with previous studies, we have comprehensively improved the performance of the AECOPD prediction model by adding objective lifestyle and environmental data. This model could yield more accurate prediction results for COPD patients than using only questionnaire data."

The objectives were to identify physiological and clinical parameters that predict the occurrence and severity of OSA and to investigate the effect of OSA on quality of life in patients with CRDs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Seventy-three patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 77 patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG) and pulmonary function testing and completed clinical questionnaires.

The COPD assessment test item scores related to sleep quality and daily vitality were worse among patients with OSA than among patients without OSA. The STOP-BANG questionnaire (cutoff point ≥ 3) and oxygen desaturation index from the oximetry recording (oxygen desaturation index (ODI) were associated with OSA in CRDs. The STOP-BANG questionnaire with a cutoff point ≥ 3 or 6 had the highest sensitivity and specificity, respectively, in detecting OSA in CRDs. ODI had the best accuracy in identifying OSA and was independently associated with the apnea-hypopnea index in CRDs.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found OSA to be common and associated with worse sleep quality and less daily vitality in patients with advanced CRDs.

            "abstract": "Patients with severe COPD often exhibit a ventilatory limit to exercise. This is associated with a shallow breathing pattern when compared with normal control subjects. It is unclear, however, what factors affect differences in breathing patterns within this patient population. To further investigate the tidal volume (VT) response to exercise in severe COPD, nine patients were recruited to undergo a maximal incremental exercise test. Pulmonary function tests, collection of expired gases, and continuous pulse oximetry were performed. As a group, the results were as follows (mean +/- SD): The FEV1 was 31 +/- 7 percent of predicted, the FRC was 143 +/- 18 percent of predicted, and the DCO was 47 +/- 15 percent of predicted. Exercise testing showed an oxygen consumption at peak exercise of only 44 +/- 9 percent predicted, a dyspnea index of 101 +/- 19 percent predicted, a heart rate at peak exercise of 75 +/- 12 percent predicted, a tidal volume at peak exercise (PKVT) of 1.23 +/- .35, a respiratory rate at peak exercise (PKfb) of 26 +/- 6, and an oxygen saturation at peak exercise (PKO2sat) of 96 +/- 4 percent. An anaerobic threshold (AT) occurred in seven of the nine patients at a mean of 31 +/- 8 percent predicted maximal oxygen consumption. Regression analysis showed the PKVT to be inversely correlated with the FEV1 (r = -0.76; p = 0.01) and the PKfb (r = -0.85; p = 0.003), while positively correlating with the FRC (r = +0.80; p = 0.01) and the PKO2sat (r = +0.69; p = 0.04). Additionally, there was a trend for the PKVT to be inversely related with the AT (r = -0.72; p = 0.06). In COPD, the more severe the obstruction and hyperinflation, the larger the VT response to exercise. This may serve to avoid a deleterious increase in autoPEEP by promoting a lengthening of the expiratory time. Furthermore, given the association of an earlier AT and a higher PKO2sat with a larger PKVT, this would suggest that such a response may minimize the effects of dead space and/or autoPEEP on O2 delivery (early AT)."

In this study, these devices were compared in terms of their potentiality to worsen respiratory acidosis and their capacity to maintain adequate (> 90%) arterial oxygenation (Sa,O2) through time (approximately 24 h). In a randomized cross-over study, 18 consecutive COPD patients who required hospitalization because of ARF were studied. After determining baseline arterial blood gas levels (on room air), patients were randomized to receive oxygen therapy through a VM or NPs at the lowest possible inspiratory oxygen fraction that resulted in an initial Sa,O2 of > or = 90%. Arterial blood gas levels were measured again 30 min later (on O2), and Sa,O2 recorded using a computer during the subsequent approximately 24 h. Patients were then crossed-over to receive O2 therapy by means of the alternative device (NPs or VM), and the same measurements obtained again in the same order. It was observed that both the VM and NPs improved arterial oxygen tension (p<0.0001) to the same extent (p=NS), without any significant effect upon arterial carbon dioxide tension or pH. However, despite this adequate initial oxygenation, Sa,O2 was < 90% for 3.7+/-3.8 h using the VM and for 5.4+/-5.9 h using NPs (p<0.05). Regression analysis showed that the degree of arterial hypoxaemia (p<0.05) and arterial hypercapnia (p<0.05) present before starting O2 therapy and, particularly, the initial Sa,O2 achieved after initiation of O2 therapy (p<0.0001) enabled the time (in h) that patients would be poorly oxygenated (Sa,O2 < 90%) on follow-up to be predicted. These findings suggest that, in order to maintain an adequate (> 90%) level of arterial oxygenation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and moderate acute respiratory failure: 1) the initial arterial oxygen saturation on oxygen should be maximized whenever possible by increasing the inspiratory oxygen fraction; 2) this strategy seems feasible because neither the VM nor NPs worsen respiratory acidosis significantly; and 3) the Venturi mask (better than nasal prongs) should be recommended."

There was a significant interaction between baseline exercise self-efficacy and randomization group on change in PA. In the comparison group, there was a significant relationship between higher baseline exercise self-efficacy and greater change in PA, whereas in the intervention group, improvements in PA were independent of level of baseline self-efficacy.

The study protocol comprised a medical and occupational questionnaire, spirometric tests at both evaluations, and noninvasive measure of blood oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry (S(p,O(2))) at T3. In 1998, the prevalence of chronic bronchitis was higher in dairy farmers. In cross-sectional analyses, all respiratory function parameters and S(p,O(2)) were significantly lower in dairy farmers. In a multiple linear regression model, farming, age, male sex and smoking were significantly and negatively correlated with S(p,O(2)). However, the mean annual decline in respiratory function parameters did not differ significantly between groups. After adjustment of covariables, accelerated decline in vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second was associated with age, smoking and male sex. Decline in vital capacity was accelerated in dairy farmers working in traditional farms and those currently foddering. The current study demonstrates that dairy farming is associated with an increased risk of lung disorders and a decrease in blood oxygen saturation and suggests that respiratory function impairment is correlated with cumulated exposure to organic dusts."

There is no uniform definition of exertional hypoxemia or standardized exercise protocol to elicit decreases in oxygen levels in individuals with COPD. The causes for exertional desaturation in patients with COPD are multifactorial with ventilation-perfusion mismatching, diffusion-type limitation, shunting and reduced oxygen content of mixed venous blood all contributing to some degree. Neither resting oxygen saturation nor pulmonary function studies can reliably predict which patients with COPD will develop exertional desaturation. However, preserved pulmonary function, especially diffusing capacity, reliably predicts which patients with COPD will sustain oxygenation during exercise. Although exertional desaturation in patients with COPD appears to portend a poor prognosis, there is no evidence that maintenance of normoxemia during exercise improves the survival of these patients. Studies of the effect of supplemental oxygen on exercise performance in individuals with COPD who desaturate with exertion have yielded conflicting results. The use of short-term or \"burst\" oxygen either prior to or after exertion may not have significant clinical benefit. Differences in the definition of desaturation, mode of exercise, and characteristics of the patient population make it difficult to compare studies of exertional desaturation and its treatment and to determine their applicability to clinical practice."

In the present study, the importance of nocturnal hypoxaemia (measured by a nocturnal pulse oximetry) for the renal function was determined in 19 COPD patients, with normal levels of serum creatinine. The effects on kidney function of alleviating the nocturnal hypoxaemia [using 6 months of long-term oxygen treatment (LTOT)], was assessed in 12 patients. Renal function was assessed by determining the clearances of intravenously administered inulin (C(In)) and para-amino-hippurate (C(PAH)) and orally supplemented lithium (C(Li)) and of circulating sodium (C(Na)). The 19 patients had a mean PaO2 of 7.63 +/- 1.08 kPa, a PaCO2 of 5.98 +/- 0.85 kPa, a mean nocturnal oxygen saturation (MnSaO2) of 87.7 +/- 2.8% and an FEV1 in %P of 25.6 +/- 14.6%.

Six months of LTOT in 12 of the patients was not followed by any significant change in renal function in the entire study group. However, low pretreatment MnSaO2 correlated with reductions in post-treatment (FF) (r=0.73, P<0.05). Post-treatment PaCO2 did not change significantly in patients treated with oral diuretics, but increased (P<0.05) in patients without diuretics.

Some body positions (particularly head-down tilt) significantly affect these measures in people with normal respiratory function and with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This may have implications for people with cystic fibrosis (CF), who use coughing and huffing and may use gravity-assisted drainage positions for airway clearance. Previous research concluded that body position does not affect MEP in people with CF, although head-down tilt was not examined and PEFR was not measured. This study investigated the effect of body position on MEP and PEFR in 20 adults with stable CF. Repeated measures of MEP and PEFR were performed across seven positions (standing, chair-sitting, sitting in bed with backrest vertical, sitting in bed with backrest at 45 degrees , supine, side-lying, and side-lying with head-down tilt 20 degrees ) in random order. During testing, reflux sensation and oxygenation were monitored. MEP was significantly reduced in side-lying and in the head-down tilt position. PEFRs were significantly reduced in the three-quarters sitting, supine, side-lying, and head-down positions. Oxygenation and reflux scores were worst in the head-down position. Despite statistical significance, the differences observed between positions in this stable population were of small magnitude.

Since then, we have witnessed a rapid development of numerous tests, varying in their protocols and clinical applications. The relatively simple \"field tests\" (shuttle walks, stair climb, 6-minute walk test) require minimal equipment and technical support, and so are generally available to physicians and patients. At the other end of the spectrum is the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), more complex in its equipment requirements, technical support, and with an often complex interpretive strategy. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT), in particular, has evolved into a versatile study with diagnostic utility in many disorders, including COPD, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease, congestive heart failure, and in the pre-surgical evaluation of patients, among others. With the added dimensions of optional O(2) saturation monitoring and calculated post-exercise heart rate recovery, the 6MWT is providing important clinical information well beyond the measure of distance walked. Is it sufficiently robust and informative to replace the more demanding and less available CPET? In many instances, the clinical applications are overlapping, with the 6MWT functioning as an adequate surrogate. However, in the initial evaluation of unexplained dyspnea, in formal evaluation of impairment and disability, in detailed evaluation of congestive heart failure, and in the selected lung cancer patient prior to resection, CPET remains superior. Investigations of portable metabolic and cardiovascular monitoring devices aiming to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of 6MWT may further narrow or close the remaining gap between these two exercise studies."

Bland-Altman analysis was used to examine the agreement of TEE and PAL between the DLW method and the accelerometer. TEE and PAL using DLW in the total population were 2273±445 kcal·day-1 and 1.80±0.20, respectively. TEE by DLW correlated well with that from the accelerometer and grip strength (p<0.0001), and PAL by DLW correlated well with that from the accelerometer (p<0.0001), grip strength and 6-min walk distance (p<0.001) among various clinical parameters. However, the accelerometer underestimated TEE (215±241 kcal·day-1) and PAL (0.18±0.16), with proportional biases in both indices. TEE and PAL can be estimated by accelerometer in patients with COPD if systematic errors and relevant clinical factors such as muscle strength and exercise capacity are accounted for."

            "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to examine the competitive physiological movement demands of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college football players using portable global positioning system (GPS) technology during games and to examine positional groups within offensive and defensive teams, to determine if a player's physiological requirements during games are influenced by playing position. Thirty-three NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision football players were monitored using GPS receivers with integrated accelerometers (GPSports) during 12 regular season games throughout the 2014 season. Individual data sets (n = 295) from players were divided into offensive and defensive teams and subsequent position groups. Movement profile characteristics, including total, low-intensity, moderate-intensity, high-intensity, and sprint running distances (m), sprint counts, and acceleration and deceleration efforts, were assessed during games. A one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferroni statistical analysis were used to determine differences in movement profiles between each position group within offensive and defensive teams. For both offensive and defensive teams, significant (p ≤ 0.05) differences exist between positional groups for game physical performance requirements. The results of the present study identified that wide receivers and defensive backs completed significantly (p ≤ 0.05) greater total distance, high-intensity running, sprint distance, and high-intensity acceleration and deceleration efforts than their respective offensive and defensive positional groups. Data from the present study provide novel quantification of position-specific physical demands of college football games and support the use of position-specific training in the preparation of NCAA Division I college football players for competition."

            "abstract": "The provision of domiciliary oxygen to patients hypoxic at hospital discharge has been termed short-term oxygen therapy (STOT). This practice appears widespread, although there is a paucity of literature and no evidence-based guidelines. We undertook this audit to examine the prescription of STOT and determine the proportion fulfilling for long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) 2 months post-discharge. STOT was defined prospectively: resting PaO2 < or = 7.3 kPa (55 mmHg) or PaO2 between 7.3 and 8.0 kPa (60 mmHg) with any of the following: clinical evidence of cor pulmonale (pedal oedema or jugular venous distension), ECG evidence of pulmonale, echocardiogram evidence of pulmonary hypertension, haematocrit > 0.55 (adapted directly from LTOT criteria). Patients were evaluated for LTOT 2 months post-discharge when clinically stable on optimal medical management. All referrals to the Auckland Regional Oxygen Service between July 1998 and 1999 were systematically reviewed. The majority 289/405 (71%) of new referrals were for the prescription of STOT/LTOT in patients with chronic lung disease: 160/289 (55%) derived from hospitalized patients with the majority 130 (81%) fulfilling criteria for STOT, median age 73, range 24-96 years. Mean hospital stay was 10.2 days. Two months after discharge 22/127 (17%) of STOT patients had died, comparable with 4/22 (18%) not fulfilling criteria for STOT. A total of 123 patients were assessed for LTOT at 2 months; 76 (62%) fulfilled criteria for LTOT. The prescription of oxygen at hospital discharge represented a considerable proportion of our referral load. There was a high mortality in the 2-month follow-up period. A significant proportion of STOT patients did not subsequently fulfill criteria for LTOT. Further prospective studies are required in order to develop evidence-based guidelines."

This study investigated the activity behavior of patients with COPD in detail compared to asymptomatic controls, and the relationship between subjective and objective activities (awareness), and readiness to change activity behavior. Methods. Thirty-nine patients with COPD (66.0 years; FEV(1)% predicted: 44.9%) and 21 healthy controls (57.0 years) participated. Objective daily activity was assessed by accelerometry and expressed as amount of activity in counts per minute (cpm). Patients' baseline subjective activity and stage of change were assessed prior to measurements. Results. Mean daily activity in COPD patients was significantly lower compared to the healthy controls (864 ± 277 cpm versus 1162 ± 282 cpm, P < 0.001). COPD patients showed a temporary decrease in objective activities in the early afternoon. Objective and subjective activities were significantly moderately related and most patients (55.3%) were in the maintenance phase of the stages of change. Conclusions. COPD patients show a distinctive activity decrease in the early afternoon. COPD patients are moderately aware of their daily activity but regard themselves as physically active. Therefore, future telemedicine interventions might consider creating awareness of an active lifestyle and provide feedback that aims to increase and balance activity levels."

Changes in the status of arterial oxygenation during and after therapy with ultrasonic nebulization in a group of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are generally small and of no statistical and limited clinical significance; however, alarming falls in arterial oxygenation can occur and cannot be predicted by base-line testing of pulmonary function or studies of arterial blood.

The two RCTs of high-fat/low-carbohydrate enteral nutrition found favorable physiologic effects on CO2 production and respiratory quotient, rendering this type of nutrition potentially useful in patients with impaired ventilatory reserve; however, no conclusions can be made about the outcomes of the duration of ventilation and weaning success. The two RCTs of postextubation use of noninvasive ventilation are conflicting, showing potential short-term physiologic benefit in one study, but no benefit in terms of reintubation rates or other morbidity. These RCTs are less promising than other applications of noninvasive ventilation such as those in patients with COPD exacerbations. One RCT showed no improvement in success of weaning with exogenous growth hormone administration. In the setting of very frequent baseline blood gas analyses, one RCT of oximetry and capnography was associated with significantly fewer blood gas analyses. Biofeedback to enhance safe and rapid weaning showed a dramatically lower duration of ventilation in one RCT that did not report the weaning methods used. One RCT of preextubation acupuncture showed lower rates of laryngospasm in the acupuncture group. Overall, these studies were underpowered for clinically important outcomes. Multidisciplinary, patient-centered, holistic, and non-pulmonary approaches to weaning may provide additional safe, effective adjunctive methods of hastening liberation from mechanical ventilation."

A cross-sectional weighted analysis indicated that 14.6% of study participants had a measured airflow obstruction consistent with COPD. Time in PA (moderate-vigorous and light PA), number of steps, and sedentary duration were not significantly different in participants with COPD, taken together, compared to controls. However, moderate to severe COPD participants (stages ≥2) had a significantly lower daily time spent in PA of moderate and vigorous intensity level compared to controls. Canadian adults with COPD with all disease severity levels combined did not show lower daily duration of light, moderate, and vigorous PA, and number of steps and higher daily sedentary time than those without airflow obstruction.

The patients belonged to three groups: (1) 31 haemodynamically stable patients with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD); (2) 49 haemodynamically stable patients without COLD; and (3) 23 haemodynamically unstable patients without COLD. Arterial and venous (peripheral and, where possible, central and mixed) blood samples were taken simultaneously and anaerobically. Peripheral arterial oxygen saturation was measured with a pulse oximeter. The principle of the method is to simulate the transport of venous blood back through the tissues using the respiratory quotient (adding oxygen and removing carbon dioxide) until simulated arterial oxygenation matches that measured by pulse oximetry.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Calculated values of arterial pH and Pco(2) had very small bias and standard deviations regardless of the venous sampling site. In all cases these errors were within those considered acceptable for the performance of laboratory equipment, and well within the limits of error acceptable in clinical practice. In addition, the standard deviation (SD) of calculated values of pH and Pco(2) was similar to the variability between consecutive arterial samples. For peripheral oxygen saturation values < or =96%, the method can calculate Po(2) with an SD of 0.93, which may be useful in clinical practice. Calculations made from peripheral venous blood were significantly more accurate than those from central venous blood.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Arterial pH and Pco(2) can be calculated precisely from peripheral venous blood in a broad patient population. The method has potential for use as a screening tool in emergency medical departments and in medical and surgical wards to assess a patient's acid-base and oxygenation status prior to sampling arterial blood or to help in the decision to refer the patient to the ICU. In departments where arterial blood gas values are used to monitor patients (eg, pulmonary medicine), the method might reduce the number of arterial samples taken by replacing them with peripheral venous blood samples, thus reducing the need for painful arterial punctures."

Airflow obstruction is related to reduced LV end-diastolic volume, stroke volume, and cardiac output. The ratio of peak early diastolic filling velocity of the mitral inflow to peak early diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus (E/e'), an echocardiographic parameter, can be applied as a surrogate marker of LV filling pressures. Forty-seven individuals with suspected COPD underwent pulmonary function tests and echocardiography. The ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1s to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) and the E/e' ratio were determined. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the FEV1/FVC ratio (β=0.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.019; p=0.036) independently predicted the log transformed E/e' ratio. An increase of FEV1/FVC ratio (in percentage) by 1 unit was associated with an increase of the E/e' ratio multiplied by 1.01.

Physiologic sensor data significantly improved the explained variance in energy expenditure determination (r(2)=0.88) compared to accelerometry data alone (r(2)=0.68).

Global positioning systems (GPS) with integrated triaxial accelerometers were used to measure exercise workloads (PlayerLoad) during each AFL match.

COPD, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, neuromuscular disorders, various restrictive disorders, and patients with sleep-disordered breathing are the major groups concerned. The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize current knowledge in the field of monitoring during home ventilation. LTNIV improves symptoms related to CHRF, diurnal and nocturnal blood gases, survival, and health-related quality of life. Initially, patients with LTNIV were most often followed through elective short in-hospital stays to ensure patient comfort, correction of daytime blood gases and nocturnal oxygenation, and control of nocturnal respiratory events. Because of the widespread use of LTNIV, elective in-hospital monitoring has become logistically problematic, time consuming, and costly. LTNIV devices presently have a built-in software which records compliance, leaks, tidal volume, minute ventilation, cycles triggered and cycled by the patient and provides detailed pressure and flow curves. Although the engineering behind this information is remarkable, the quality and reliability of certain signals may vary. Interpretation of the curves provided requires a certain level of training. Coupling ventilator software with nocturnal pulse oximetry or transcutaneous capnography performed at the patient's home can however provide important information and allow adjustments of ventilator settings thus potentially avoiding hospital admissions. Strategies have been described to combine different tools for optimal detection of an inefficient ventilation. Recent devices also allow adapting certain parameters at a distance (pressure support, expiratory positive airway pressure, back-up respiratory rate), thus allowing progressive changes in these settings for increased patient comfort and tolerance, and reducing the requirement for in-hospital titration. Because we live in a connected world, analyzing large groups of patients through treatment of \"big data\" will probably improve our knowledge of clinical pathways of our patients, and factors associated with treatment success or failure, adherence and efficacy. This approach provides a useful add-on to randomized controlled studies and allows generating hypotheses for better management of HMV."

Multivariate analysis revealed that all-cause mortality was associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (odds ratio, OR: 7.07, 95% CI 2.75-18.16), chronic heart failure (CHF) (OR: 5.47, 95% CI 1.06-28.31), diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR: 3.30, 95% CI 1.51-7.20) and body mass index (BMI) (increase of 5 kg m(-2), OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.04-1.99). Chronic upper airway problems were associated with survival (OR: 0.45, 95% CI 0.23-0.90). There were significant interactions between respiratory disturbance index and BMI and COPD. Mortality of patients younger than the median age (62 years) was associated with COPD, DM and an interaction between BMI and apnoea severity. Predictors of mortality for the older patients were COPD, CHF and DM. We conclude that all-cause mortality in sleep apnoea is associated with co-morbidities and obesity.

            "abstract": "The elderly and individuals who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may be sensitive to particulate matter (PM) air pollution. We evaluated short-term health responses of 13 elderly volunteers with COPD and 6 age-matched healthy adults to controlled exposures of ambient PM pollution in suburban Los Angeles. Using a Harvard particle concentrator and a whole-body chamber, we exposed each person on separate occasions to approximately 200 microg/m(3) concentrated ambient particles (CAP) less than 2.5 mum in diameter and to filtered air (FA). Each exposure lasted 2 h with intermittent mild exercise. We found no significant effects of CAP on symptoms, spirometry, or induced sputum. A significant negative effect of CAP on arterial oxygenation (measured by pulse oximetry) immediately postexposure was more pronounced in healthy subjects. Peripheral blood basophils increased after CAP in healthy but not in COPD subjects. In both groups, red cell counts increased slightly 1 day after exposure to FA but not to CAP. Preexposure ectopic heartbeats were infrequent in healthy subjects, but increased modestly during/after CAP exposure relative to FA. Ectopic beats were more frequent in COPD subjects, but decreased modestly during/after CAP relative to FA. Heart-rate variability over multi-hour intervals was lower after CAP than after FA in healthy elderly subjects but not in COPD subjects. Thus, in this initial small-scale study of older volunteers experimentally exposed to ambient PM, some acute cardiopulmonary responses were consistent with effects reported from epidemiologic studies. Unexpectedly, individuals with COPD appeared less susceptible than healthy elderly individuals. Further investigation of older adults is warranted to understand the pathophysiology and public health significance of these findings."

            "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to measure bilateral asynchrony in patients suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) performing an incremental inspiratory load protocol. Bilateral asynchrony was estimated by the comparison of respiratory movements derived from diaphragm mechanomyographic (MMGdi) signals, acquired by means of capacitive accelerometers placed on left and right sides of the rib cage. Three methods were considered for asynchrony evaluation: Lissajous figure, Hilbert transform and Motto's algorithm. Bilateral asynchrony showed an increase at 20, 40 and 60% (values of normalized inspiratory pressure by their maximum value reached in the last inspiratory load) while the very severe group showed an increase at 20, 40, 80, and 100 % during the protocol. These increments in the phase's shift can be due to an increase of the inspiratory load along the protocol, and also as a consequence of distress and fatigue. In summary, this work evidenced the capability to estimate bilateral asynchrony in COPD patients. These preliminary results also showed that the use of capacitive accelerometers can be a suitable sensor for recording of respiratory movement and evaluation of asynchrony in COPD patients."

There are no standardized procedures to assist in determining the patient's needs during the physical activities of daily life. Despite that effort tests are a wide broad approach, further research concerning the development of protocols to titrate O2 therapy is needed. The main objective of this study was to assess whether the level of oxygen titrated through the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) for patients with COPD and exertional hypoxemia is adequate to meet the patients' demand during their activities of daily living. Physiological and subjective variables were estimated for a study population during two walking tests: a 6MWT and a 20-minute walking circuit (20MWC), designed ad-hoc to reproduce daily physical activities more truthfully. The results indicate that in a significant proportion of patients, the 6MWT might not accurately predict their oxygen needs at a domiciliary environment. Therefore, the titration of the portable O2 therapy could not be optimal in these cases, with the detrimental impact on the patient's health (hyperoxia episodes), the autonomy of the oxygen device, and the decrease of time out of the home."

Twenty-seven elderly patients with COPD (age 74 ± 8 yrs; %FEV1 56.6 ± 18.7%) participated. They were randomly selected to undergo PR (pulmonary rehabilitation only) or PR + P (PR plus the feedback from using a pedometer). Their PA and pulmonary function, exercise capacity (6-min walking distance; 6MWD), quadriceps femoris muscle force (QF) were evaluated before the PR began (baseline) and at 1 year later. We compared the patients' changes in PA and other factors between the baseline values and those obtained 1 year later and analyzed the relationships between the changes in PA and other factors in the both groups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The increase in the time spent walking in the PR + P group (51.3 ± 63.7 min/day) was significantly greater than that of PR group (12.3 ± 25.5 min/day) after the PR. The improvement rate of daily walking time after PR was significantly correlated with that of the 6MWD and QF in all subjects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These data suggest that low-intensity and home-based PR with the feedback from using pedometer was effective in improving PA, and the improvements of physiological factors were correlated with increased walking time in stable elderly patients with COPD."

Exacerbation recovery is associated with reductions in lung hyperinflation and improvements in symptoms and physical activity. We assessed the feasibility of monitoring these clinical parameters in the home. We hypothesised that the degree of change in spirometry and lung volumes differs between those who had an uneventful recovery and those who experienced a further exacerbation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Hospitalised patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD referred for a supported discharge program participated in the study. Spirometry and Inspiratory Vital Capacity(IVC) were measured in the home at Days 1, 14 and 42 post-discharge. Patients also completed Medical Research Council(MRC), Borg and COPD Assessment Test(CAT) scores and were provided with a tri-axial accelerometer.

Diagnosis of CB was based on clinical, radiological, spirography and oximetry investigations. Cardiac catheterization, 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography, VCG by Mcfee-Parungao (VCG) and electrocardiography were used to establish PAH and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). Pulmonary flow was studied using impedance plethysmography (IP). Vectorcardiography, IP and Doppler echocardiography were also performed to assess the changes in QRS loop area, PF and mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm) in response to acute hypoxia (inhalation of hypoxic mixture 16% O2 for 5-10 minutes) in 21 patients with CB and 7 healthy subjects.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At baseline, patients with CB were characterized by pulmonary ventilation disturbances of mixed and obstructive types. Among patients who underwent acute hypoxia test PAPm was increased in 10 patients (29.2+/-2.1 mmHg) (Group 1), while in the latter 11 patients the PAPm was within normal values (16.5+/-1.8 mmHg) (Group 2). The IP showed reduction of PF and increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. Patients with CB react to the acute hypoxic test by increase in PAPm by 32% (absolute increase up to 22.5+/-0.7 mm Hg) in group 2 and by 38.9% (absolute increase up to 39.7+/-2.1 mmHg) in patients of group 1. There was a displacement of PF on IP to the upper and middle zones of lungs during acute hypoxia: PF in the upper and middle zones of the right lung increased by 35.6% and 32.5% in patients of group 2; while in patients of group 1 the PF increased by 33.5% and 4.8% at the same zones.

Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs), mortality rates, and 95% CIs were estimated using cubic splines and quartile classifications adjusting for age; sex; race/ethnicity; education; diet; smoking status; body mass index; self-reported health; mobility limitations; and diagnoses of diabetes, stroke, heart disease, heart failure, cancer, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 4840 participants (mean age, 56.8 years; 2435 [54%] women; 1732 [36%] individuals with obesity) wore accelerometers for a mean of 5.7 days for a mean of 14.4 hours per day. The mean number of steps per day was 9124. There were 1165 deaths over a mean 10.1 years of follow-up, including 406 CVD and 283 cancer deaths. The unadjusted incidence density for all-cause mortality was 76.7 per 1000 person-years (419 deaths) for the 655 individuals who took less than 4000 steps per day; 21.4 per 1000 person-years (488 deaths) for the 1727 individuals who took 4000 to 7999 steps per day; 6.9 per 1000 person-years (176 deaths) for the 1539 individuals who took 8000 to 11 999 steps per day; and 4.8 per 1000 person-years (82 deaths) for the 919 individuals who took at least 12 000 steps per day.

            "abstract": "Pulmonary function testing involves a battery of tests from the simple pulse oximetry to the cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Impulse oscillometry (IOS) is one of the newly described pulmonary function tests. It is based on the old principle of forced oscillatory technique modified and refined as per research and advances. It involves the use of sound waves during normal tidal breathing, which gives information on oscillatory pressure-flow relationships and eventually resistance and reactance. The resistance at 20 Hz (R20) represents the resistance of the large airways. The resistance at 5 Hz (R5) means the total airway resistance. (R5-R20) reflects resistance in the small airways. The reactance at 5 Hz (X5) indicates the elastic recoil of the peripheral airways. Resonant frequency and area of reactance are also measured. IOS has major uses in diagnosis and control of asthma in children and the elderly, where spirometry is otherwise normal. IOS has been studied in other respiratory diseases like COPD, ILD and supraglottic stenosis."

Physical inactivity in COPD patients is a crucial risk factor for OP; the COPD assessment test (CAT) is the newest assessment tool for the health status and daily activities of COPD patients. This study investigated the relationship among daily physical activity (DPA), CAT scores, and bone mineral density (BMD) in COPD patients with or without OP. This study included 30 participants. Ambulatory DPA was measured using actigraphy and oxygen saturation by using a pulse oximeter. BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. OP was defined as a T-score (standard deviations from a young, sex-specific reference mean BMD) less than or equal to -2.5 SD for the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck. We quantified oxygen desaturation during DPA by using a desaturation index and recorded all DPA, except during sleep. COPD patients with OP had lower DPA and higher CAT scores than those of patients without OP. DPA was significantly positively correlated with (lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck) BMD (r=0.399, 0.602, 0.438, respectively, all P<0.05) and T-score (r=0.471, 0.531, 0.459, respectively, all P<0.05), whereas CAT scores were significantly negatively correlated with (total hip and femoral neck) BMD (r=-0.412, -0.552, respectively, P<0.05) and (lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck) T-score (r=-0.389, -0.429, -0.543, respectively, P<0.05).

            "abstract": "In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), reduced levels of daily physical activity are associated with the degree of impairment in lung, peripheral muscle, and central hemodynamic function. There is, however, limited evidence as to whether limitations in tidal volume expansion also, importantly, determine daily physical activity levels in COPD. Eighteen consecutive patients with COPD [9 active (forced expiratory volume in 1 s, FEV1: 1.59 ± 0.64 l) with an average daily movement intensity >1.88 m/s(2) and 9 less active patients (FEV1: 1.16 ± 0.41 l) with an average intensity <1.88 m/s(2)] underwent a 4-min treadmill test at a constant speed corresponding to each individual patient's average movement intensity, captured by a triaxial accelerometer during a preceding 7-day period. When chest wall volumes, captured by optoelectronic plethysmography, were expressed relative to comparable levels of minute ventilation (ranging between 14.5 ± 4.3 to 33.5 ± 4.4 l/min), active patients differed from the less active ones in terms of the lower increase in end-expiratory chest wall volume (by 0.15 ± 0.17 vs. 0.45 ± 0.21 l), the greater expansion in tidal volume (by 1.76 ± 0.58 vs. 1.36 ± 0.24 l), and the larger inspiratory reserve chest wall volume (IRVcw: by 0.81 ± 0.25 vs. 0.39 ± 0.27 l). IRVcw (r(2) = 0.420), expiratory flow (r(2) change = 0.174), and Borg dyspnea score (r(2) change = 0.123) emerged as the best contributors, accounting for 71.7% of the explained variance in daily movement intensity. Patients with COPD exhibiting greater ability to expand tidal volume and to maintain adequate inspiratory reserve volume tend to be more physically active. Thus interventions aiming at mitigating restrictions on operational chest wall volumes are expected to enhance daily physical activity levels in COPD."

During a rehabilitation programme, we studied 30 patients with moderate-to-severe COPD (median forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 37% of predicted), without marked hypoxaemia (median arterial oxygen tension (Pa,O2) 9.1 kPa). Arterial oxygen saturation (Sa,O2) was assessed by pulse oximetry during night (8 h) and day (10.5 h). The mean and minimal Sa,O2 were calculated, and desaturations were defined as Sa,O2 falls > 4%.h-1. Daily activities were identified by the patients as resting, eating, washing, nebulization therapy and walking. Mean Sa,O2 was lower during the night (88%) than during the day (89%). In contrast, minimal Sa,O2 was lower during the day (69%) than during the night (72%), and the number of desaturations was higher during the day (8.6 desaturations.h-1) than during the night (6.8 desaturations.h-1). Mean Sa,O2 was 88% during walking, which was lower than during resting (90%), nebulization (90%), and meals (89%).

            "abstract": "The management of patients with unilateral pneumonia and severe hypoxemia often represents a therapeutic challenge. Mechanical ventilation with the diseased lung uppermost may improve gas exchange, but it is not devoid of adverse effects. No hemodynamic measurements have been reported in patients ventilated in this manner; therefore, whether or not the improvement in PaO2 is counterbalanced by hemodynamic deterioration remains unknown. Almitrine bismesylate is a drug that seems able to improve gas exchange in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or the adult respiratory distress syndrome. The increase in PaO2 after its administration has been attributed to an improvement in ventilation-perfusion relationships. Its use has never been reported during unilateral pneumonia with severe hypoxemia. We therefore compared its effects with those of lateral position in eight consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with unilateral pneumonia. Blood gas and hemodynamic measurements were performed both at maintenance FIO2 and at an FIO2 of 1.0. Almitrine (1 mg/kg over 1 h) had no effect on PaO2 under either FIO2 condition. Cardiac output remained unchanged, but mean pulmonary artery pressure increased from 22.5 +/- 1.2 to 26.5 +/- 1.3 mm Hg (p < 0.02). By contrast, lateral position had striking effects on PaO2, which increased from 100 +/- 14 mm Hg in supine position to 156 +/- 23 mm Hg (p < 0.01) when the abnormal lung was placed uppermost at maintenance FIO2 and from 207 +/- 21 (supine) to 300 +/- 28 mm Hg (lateral) (p < 0.01) at FIO2 1.0.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "title": "Retinal oximetry and systemic arterial oxygen levels.",
            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Continuous peripheral pulse oximetry for monitoring adequacy of oxygenation is probably the most important technological advance for patients' monitoring and safety in the last decades. Pulse oximetry has the disadvantage of measuring the peripheral circulation, and the only mean to measure oxygen content of the central circulation is by invasive technology. Determination of blood oxyhaemoglobin saturation in the retinal vessels of the eye can be achieved noninvasively through spectrophotometric retinal oximetry which provides access to the central nervous system circulation. The aim of the thesis was to determine whether retinal oximetry technique can be applied for estimation of the central nervous system circulation which until now has only been possible invasively. This was achieved by measuring oxyhaemoglobin saturation in three adult subject study groups: in people with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) to observe local tissue hypoxia, in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on long-term oxygen therapy to observe systemic hypoxaemia and in healthy subjects during hyperoxic breathing to observe systemic hyperoxemia. In addition, the fourth study that is mentioned was performed to test whether retinal oximetry is feasible for neonates.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Retinal oximetry in central retinal vein occlusion: Sixteen subjects with central retinal vein occlusion participated in the study. The oxyhaemoglobin saturation of the central retinal vein occlusion affected eye was compared with the fellow unaffected eye. Retinal oximetry in healthy people under hyperoxia: Thirty healthy subjects participated in the study, and the oxyhaemoglobin saturation of retinal arterioles and venules was compared between normoxic and hyperoxic breathing. Retinal oximetry in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Eleven patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease participated in the study. Retinal oximetry measurements were made with and without their daily supplemental oxygen therapy. Retinal arteriolar oxyhaemoglobin saturation when inspiring ambient air was compared with blood samples from the radial artery and finger pulse oximetry and healthy controls. The healthy control group was assembled from our database for comparison of oxyhaemoglobin saturation of retinal arterioles and venules during the ambient air breathing. The retinal oximeter is based on a conventional fundus camera and a specialized software. A beam splitter coupled with two high-resolution digital cameras allows for simultaneous acquisition of retinal images at separative wavelengths for calculation of oxyhaemoglobin saturation. In addition, retinal images of 28 full-term healthy neonates were obtained with scanning laser ophthalmoscope combined with modified Oxymap analysis software for calculation of the optical density ratio and vessel diameter RESULTS: Retinal oximetry in central retinal vein occlusion: Mean retinal venous oxyhaemoglobin saturation was 31 ± 12% in CRVO eyes and 52 ± 11% in unaffected fellow eyes (mean ± SD, n = 14, p < 0.0001). The arteriovenous oxygen difference (AV-difference) was 63 ± 11% in CRVO eyes and 43 ± 7% in fellow eyes (p < 0.0001). The variability of retinal venous oxyhaemoglobin saturation was considerable within and between eyes affected by CRVO. There was no difference in oxyhaemoglobin saturation of retinal arterioles between the CRVO eyes and the unaffected eyes (p = 0.49). Retinal oximetry in healthy people under hyperoxia: During hyperoxic breathing, the oxyhaemoglobin saturation in retinal arterioles increased to 94.5 ± 3.8% as compared with 92.0 ± 3.7% at baseline (n = 30, p < 0.0001). In venules, the mean oxyhaemoglobin saturation increased to 76.2 ± 8.0% from 51.3 ± 5.6% (p < 0.0001) at baseline. The AV-difference was markedly lower during hyperoxic breathing as compared with the normoxic breathing (18.3 ± 9.0% versus 40.7 ± 5.7%, p < 0.0001). Retinal oximetry in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: During ambient air breathing, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subjects had significantly lower oxyhaemoglobin saturation than healthy controls in both retinal arterioles (87.2 ± 4.9% versus 93.4 ± 4.3%, p = 0.02, n = 11) and venules (45.0 ± 10.3% versus 55.2 ± 5.5%, p = 0.01) but the AV-difference was not markedly different (p = 0.17). Administration of their prescribed oxygen therapy significantly increased the oxyhaemoglobin saturation in retinal arterioles (87.2 ± 4.9% to 89.5 ± 6.0%, p = 0.02) but not in venules (45.0 ± 10.3% to 46.7 ± 12.8%, p = 0.3). Retinal oximetry values were slightly lower than finger pulse oximetry (mean percentage points difference = -3.1 ± 5.5) and radial artery blood values (-5.0 ± 5.4). Retinal oximetry study in neonates: The modified version of the retinal oximetry instrument estimated the optical density ratio in retinal arterioles to be 0.256 ± 0.041 that was significantly different from the 0.421 ± 0.089 in venules (n = 28, p < 0.001, paired t-test). The vascular diameter of retinal arterioles was markedly narrower than of venules (14.1 ± 2.7 and 19.7 ± 3.7 pixels, p < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The results of this thesis indicate that spectrophotometric retinal oximetry is sensitive to both local and systemic changes in oxyhaemoglobin saturation. Retinal oxyhaemoglobin saturation values are slightly lower than radial artery blood sample and finger pulse oximetry values. The discrepancies between the different modalities are expected to derive from countercurrent exchange between central retinal artery and vein within the optic nerve but calibration issues cannot be excluded as contributing to this difference. Despite these differences, the findings indicate the potential of retinal oximetry for noninvasive real-time measurements of oxyhaemoglobin saturation in central nervous system vessels. Following calibration upgrade and technological improvement, verification retinal oximetry may potentially be applied to critically ill and anaesthesia care patients. The study on combined scanning laser ophthalmoscope and retinal oximetry supports the feasibility of the technique for oximetry analysis in newly born babies."

Early detection of exacerbations, and therefore early treatment, could be crucial in preventing admission and improving outcomes. Our previous research has demonstrated that the pattern analysis of peripheral oxygen saturation (Sp O2 ) fluctuations provides novel insights into the engagement of the respiratory control system in response to physiological stress (hypoxia). Therefore, this pilot study tested the hypothesis that the pattern of Sp O2 variations in overnight recordings of individuals with COPD would distinguish between stable and exacerbation phases of the disease.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Overnight pulse oximetry data from 11 individuals with COPD, who exhibited exacerbation after a period of stable disease, were examined. Stable phase recordings were conducted overnight and one night prior to exacerbation recordings were also analyzed. Pattern analysis of Sp O2 variations was carried examined using sample entropy (for assessment of irregularity), the multiscale entropy (complexity), and detrended fluctuation analysis (self-similarity).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Sp O2 variations displayed a complex pattern in both stable and exacerbation phases of COPD. During an exacerbation, Sp O2 entropy increased (p = 0.029) and long-term fractal-like exponent (α2) decreased (p = 0.002) while the mean and standard deviation of Sp O2 time series remained unchanged. Through ROC analyses, Sp O2 entropy and α2 were both able to classify the COPD phases into either stable or exacerbation phase. With the best positive predictor value (PPV) for sample entropy (PPV = 70%) and a cut-off value of 0.454. While the best negative predictor value (NPV) was α2 (NPV = 78%) with a cut-off value of 1.00.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Alterations in Sp O2 entropy and the fractal-like exponent have the potential to detect exacerbations in COPD. Further research is warranted to examine if Sp O2 variability analysis could be used as a novel objective method of detecting exacerbations."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Anxiety and depression are common comorbidities in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). While these comorbidities could potentially lead to a higher motivation to learn about self-management, they could also inhibit patients from translating this knowledge into appropriate self-management behaviours. This paper explores the moderating effects of anxiety and depression on a health-mentoring intervention, focusing on mechanisms of change (mediation).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      182 COPD patients participated in an RCT, with anxiety and depression assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), self-management knowledge by the Partners in Health Scale, and spontaneous physical activity using accelerometers, all measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months. The moderated mediation model tested the intervention's effect on physical activity, mediated via changes in self-management knowledge, at different levels of anxiety and depression.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Knowledge mediated the effect of the intervention on changes in physical activity only for participants reporting low levels of anxiety or depression.

This suggests that patients with elevated anxiety or depression may need to be treated appropriately before engaging in chronic disease self-management interventions."

Of the 15 patients eligible, 14 were recruited and randomised to TC or UC and 12 completed (67% male; mean ± SD age; 58 ± 7 years; COPD n = 4, ILD n = 6, CF n = 1, PH n = 1): TC (n = 7) and UC (n = 5). TC was well accepted by patients, with 86% indicating that they enjoyed taking part. Usage of the pedometer was excellent, with all patients wearing it for over 90% of days and rating the pedometer and telephone contact as the most vital aspects. There were no adverse events related to the intervention. After 12 weeks, only TC displayed improvements in accelerometry steps/day (by 3475 ± 3422; p = .036) and movement intensity (by 153 ± 166 VMU; p = .019), whereas both TC and UC groups exhibited clinically important changes in physical SF-36 scores (by 11 ± 14 and 7 ± 9 points, respectively).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      TC appears to be a feasible, safe, and well-accepted intervention in LTx."

Peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), as assessed by pulse oximetry, is commonly measured during the day using a spot check, or continuously during one or two nights to estimate nocturnal desaturation. Sampling at this frequency may overlook natural fluctuations in SpO2.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study used wearable finger pulse oximeters to continuously measure SpO2 during daily home routines of COPD patients and assess natural SpO2 fluctuations.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 20 COPD patients wore a WristOx2 pulse oximeter for 1 week to collect continuous SpO2 measurements. A SenseWear Armband simultaneously collected actigraphy measurements to provide contextual information. SpO2 time series were preprocessed and data quality was assessed afterward. Mean SpO2, SpO2 SD, and cumulative time spent with SpO2 below 90% (CT90) were calculated for every (1) day, (2) day in rest, and (3) night to assess SpO2 fluctuations.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A high percentage of valid SpO2 data (daytime: 93.27%; nocturnal: 99.31%) could be obtained during a 7-day monitoring period, except during moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (67.86%). Mean nocturnal SpO2 (89.9%, SD 3.4) was lower than mean daytime SpO2 in rest (92.1%, SD 2.9; P<.001). On average, SpO2 in rest ranged over 10.8% (SD 4.4) within one day. Highly varying CT90 values between different nights led to 50% (10/20) of the included patients changing categories between desaturator and nondesaturator over the course of 1 week.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Continuous SpO2 measurements with wearable finger pulse oximeters identified significant SpO2 fluctuations between and within multiple days and nights of patients with COPD. Continuous SpO2 measurements during daily home routines of patients with COPD generally had high amounts of valid data, except for motion artifacts during MVPA. The identified fluctuations can have implications for telemonitoring applications that are based on daily SpO2 spot checks. CT90 values can vary greatly from night to night in patients with a nocturnal mean SpO2 around 90%, indicating that these patients cannot be consistently categorized as desaturators or nondesaturators. We recommend using wearable sensors for continuous SpO2 measurements over longer time periods to determine the clinical relevance of the identified SpO2 fluctuations."

            "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) claimed 3.0 million lives in 2016 and ranked 3rd among the top 10 global causes of death. Moreover, once diagnosed and discharged from the hospital, the 30-day readmission risk in COPD patients is found to be the highest among all chronic diseases. The existing diagnosis methods, such as Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2019, Body-mass index, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise (BODE) index, modified Medical Research Council (mMRC), COPD assessment test (CAT), 6-minute walking distance, which are adopted currently by physicians cannot predict the potential readmission of COPD patients, especially within the 30 days after discharge from the hospital. In this paper, a statistical model was proposed to predict the readmission risk of COPD patients within 30-days by monitoring their physical activity (PA) in daily living with accelerometer-based wrist-worn wearable devices. This proposed model was based on our previously reported PA models for activity index (AI) and regularity index (RI) and it introduced a new parameter, quality of activity (QoA), which incorporates previously proposed parameters, such as AI and RI, with other activity-based indices to predict the readmission risk. Data were collected from continuous PA monitoring of 16 COPD patients after hospital discharge as test subjects and readmission prediction criteria were proposed, with a 63% sensitivity and a 37.78% positive prediction rate. Compared to other clinical assessment, diagnosis, and prevention methods, the proposed model showed significant improvement in predicting the 30-day readmission risk."

This study therefore compared (i) PA differences between COPD and non-COPD controls using both traditional intensity thresholds and threshold-free metrics that represent the volume and intensity of the whole PA profile, and (ii) explored the influence of exercise capacity on observed differences. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), average acceleration (proxy for volume, mg) and intensity distribution of activity were calculated for 76 individuals with COPD and 154 non-COPD controls from wrist-worn ActiGraph accelerometry. PA profiles representing the minimum intensity (acceleration, mg) during the most active accumulated 5-960 min were plotted. Estimated VO2peak and relative intensity were derived from the incremental shuttle walk test distance. Compared to the non-COPD control group, individuals with COPD recorded fewer MVPA minutes (59 vs. 83 min/day), lower overall waking activity (29.1 vs. 36.4 mg) and a poorer waking intensity distribution (-2.73 vs. -2.57). Individuals with COPD also recorded a lower absolute intensity (acceleration, mg) for their most active 5-960 min, but higher intensity relative to their estimated exercise capacity derived from the ISWT. People with COPD have a lower volume and absolute intensity of PA than controls but perform PA at a higher relative intensity. There is a need to move away from absolute intensity thresholds, and towards personalised or relative-intensity thresholds, to reflect reduced exercise capacity in COPD populations."

Several hyperpolarized helium ((3)He) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based Pao2 mapping techniques have been reported, and considerable effort has gone toward reducing Pao2 measurement error. We present a new Pao2 imaging scheme, using parallel accelerated MRI, which significantly reduces measurement error.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      The proposed Pao2 mapping scheme was computer-simulated and was tested on both phantoms and five human subjects.

Simulation results support this observation and predict that correspondence between the true spatial distribution and the derived map is always superior using the accelerated scheme, although the improvement becomes less significant as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Paired measurements in the human subjects, comparing accelerated and fully sampled schemes, show a reduced Pao2 distribution width for 41 of 46 slices.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In contrast to proton MRI, acceleration of hyperpolarized imaging has no signal-to-noise penalty; its use in Pao2 measurement is therefore always beneficial. Comparison of multiple schemes shows that the benefit arises from a longer time-base during which oxygen-induced depolarization modifies the signal strength. Demonstration of the accelerated technique in human studies shows the feasibility of the method and suggests that measurement error is reduced here as well, particularly at low signal-to-noise levels."

The acquisition of both MMG signals was carried out by means of two capacitive accelerometers placed on both left and right sides of the costal wall. The signals were recorded in a group of six patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). It has been observed that with the increase of inspiratory pressure it takes place an increase of the amplitude and a displacement toward low frequencies in both left and right MMG signals. Furthermore, it has been seen that the increase of amplitude and the decrease of frequency in MMG signals are more pronounced in severe COPD patients.

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine whether it is possible using ear-oximetry to prescribe the correct oxygen flow rates during exercise in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT). Twenty COPD patients on LTOT, with exercise desaturation breathing oxygen at resting flow rates, performed a series of 6-min treadmill walking tests, with a progressive increase in oxygen flows until oxygen saturation measured by ear- or pulse-oximetry (Sp,O2) was above 90%. The exercise studies were repeated the next day, saturation being measured both noninvasively by ear-oximetry (Sp,O2) and invasively by CO-oximeter (Sa,O2). The exercise studies continued until both Sa,O2 and Sp,O2 were above 90%. Reproducibility and agreement of the results were analysed according to Bland and Altman. Sp,O2 was significantly lower than Sa,O2 by, on average, 0.7% (p < 0.004). Sp,O2 reproducibility between the two days was good. The invasive and noninvasive oxygen flow prescriptions agreed in only 10 subjects; in six subjects ear-oximetry over-estimated the oxygen supply (p < 0.0005), whilst in four subjects it underestimated (p < 0.01). Contingency table analysis with coded raw data for the values of the sixth minute (that of the deepest desaturation) showed poor agreement between CO- and pulse-oximetry (Chi-squared p < 0.003). However, theoretically, if the Sp,O2 target had been raised to 93%, there would have been hardly any underestimations of Sa,O2 p = NS). We concluded that noninvasive measurement of oxygen saturation is not adequate for estimating arterial saturation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We suggest, as a working solution, that a new cut-off limit of 93% oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry should be used as the value below which exercise-induced desaturation should be corrected in order to allow oxygen to be properly prescribed during activities of daily life."

            "abstract": "## AIM\nTo examine the effect of a 6-month, smartphone app-based self-management program for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n## BACKGROUND\nTechnological interventions have been used for chronic disease management, but the effect of a self-management program using a smartphone app has not been evaluated in people with COPD.\n## METHODS\nFor this randomized controlled trial, patients with COPD (N = 44) were recruited in pulmonary medicine outpatient clinics at two, metropolitan, tertiary care, academic hospitals. Eligible participants were randomized into two groups and received group education and exercise sessions in the first month of the 6-month intervention. Participants in the experimental group received a smartphone app-based self-management program, which included education, exercises, self-monitoring of symptoms and exercise, and social support. Participants in the control group received one call a month from the research staff. Self-care behavior was measured as a primary outcome. All measures were administered at baseline and at 6 months.\n## RESULTS\nAfter randomization, the experimental group numbered 22, the control group numbered 20, and 2 participants dropped out. Significant differences between groups were found in change score for self-care behavior, total activity count per wear time, and percent time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity over 6 months.\n## CONCLUSION\nA self-management program, using a smartphone app, can effect behavioral change in people with COPD. This program could be a boon to patients with COPD who have limited access to a health care provider, no opportunities for pulmonary rehabilitation, and frequent exacerbations.\n"

GaitTrack software monitors walking patterns, using only accelerometers embedded in phones to record spatiotemporal motion, without the need for sensors external to the phone. Our software transforms smartphones into health monitors, using eight parameters of phone motion transformed into body motion by the gait model. GaitTrack is designed to detect health status while the smartphone is carried during normal activities, namely, free-living walking. The current method for assessing free-living walking is medical accelerometers, so we present evidence that mobile phones running our software are more accurate. We then show our gait model is more accurate than medical pedometers for counting steps of patients with chronic disease. Our gait model was evaluated in a pilot study involving 30 patients with chronic lung disease. The six-minute walk test (6 MWT) is a major assessment for chronic heart and lung disease, including congestive heart failure and especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), affecting millions of persons. The 6 MWT consists of walking back and forth along a measured distance for 6 minutes. The gait model using linear regression performed with 94.13% accuracy in measuring walk distance, compared with the established standard of direct observation. We also evaluated a different statistical model using the same gait parameters to predict health status through lung function. This gait model has high accuracy when applied to demographic cohorts, for example, 89.22% accuracy testing the cohort of 12 female patients with ages 50-64 years."

OBJECTIVE: In a Danish setting, our aim was to measure physical activity, sedentary behavior, and physical capacity among patients with asthma. We hypothesized that people with severe asthma would be less active and more sedentary than their mild-moderate counterparts. METHODS: Adults with asthma were recruited through respiratory outpatient clinics and subsequently examined twice, 4 weeks apart. At each visit, participants underwent a series of lung function tests, questionnaires, and maximum oxygen uptake testing (VO2max). Between the visits, participants wore an accelerometer continuously for 4 weeks, measuring sedentary time and daily steps. Sixty patients, 27 with mild-moderate asthma (GINA 1-3) and 33 with severe asthma (GINA 4-5), completed both visits and had valid accelerometer measurements. RESULTS: No significant differences between the two groups were found in sedentary time, number of steps or VO2max. VO2max was significantly correlated with FeNO (r = -0.30, p < 0.05), Short Form-12 Mental Health (r = 0.37, p < 0.05), Asthma Control Questionnaire (r = -0.35, p < 0.05), and Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (r = 0.36, p < 0.05).

Because COPD can be associated in varying degrees with ischemic heart disease (IHD), and because the consequences of hypoxia in such patients can be significant, the ground and altitude pulse oximeter readings of 24 ambulatory aeromedical evacuation patients with known or suspected IHD were recorded. Written, informed consent, as well as smoking history and respiratory spirometry were obtained preflight. Results showed a mean saturation decrease of 5.5 percentage points (95% CI: 4.5-6.4).

Of 24 patients, 3 were given supplemental oxygen when their inflight oximetry readings consistently read below 90%. Saturation decrease did not correlate specifically with age, smoking history, the FEV1/FVC ratio, or the inflight cabin altitude. We conclude that ambulatory aeromedical evacuation patients with known or suspected IHD may demonstrate mild decreases in oxygen saturation which are not readily predicted by age, smoking history, pre-flight spirometry, or inflight cabin altitude.

Establishing an accurate diagnosis is essential because treatment differs depending on the underlying condition. Asthma, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, interstitial lung disease, and psychogenic causes account for 85 percent of patients with this principal symptom. The history and physical examination should guide selection of initial diagnostic tests such as electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, pulse oximetry, spirometry, complete blood count, and metabolic panel. If these are inconclusive, additional testing is indicated. Formal pulmonary function testing may be needed to establish a diagnosis of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or interstitial lung disease. High-resolution computed tomography is particularly useful for diagnosing interstitial lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, or pulmonary embolism. Echocardiography and brain natriuretic peptide levels help establish a diagnosis of congestive heart failure. If the diagnosis remains unclear, additional tests may be required.

Nocturnal desaturation was present in only 21 percent of patients. Echocardiographic measurements were similar between patients with emphysema and patients with bronchitis, and between patients with and without sleep desaturation.

            "abstract": "Quadriceps weakness is associated with a poor prognosis in COPD. Several data suggest that immobility and muscle wasting may be related through up-regulation of the p38 Mitogen associated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway. We therefore hypothesised that this might occur in the quadriceps of COPD patients. We studied 105 stable COPD outpatients (mean FEV(1) 43.9% predicted) and 27 age and gender matched controls. We measured fat-free mass, quadriceps strength and daily physical activity using triaxial accelerometry. A quadriceps biopsy was obtained in which components of the p38-MAPK signalling pathway were examined. Patients had reduced fat-free mass index (16.1 (2.2) kg/m(2) vs 17.2 (2.2) kg/m(2), p = 0.02) and exhibited quadriceps weakness (mean (SD) maximal voluntary contraction force 72.1% (18.7) predicted and 82.3% (7.1) predicted for patients and controls respectively, p = 0.01). Physical activity was significantly reduced in the patient group; in particular mean (SD) locomotion time was 101 (48) minutes/12 hours in controls and 48 (31) minutes in patients (p < 0.0001). However, in biopsies obtained from these patients, no differences were observed for total or phosphorylated HSP27 or p38 MAPK protein or p38 MAPK mRNA (MAPK14); of the downstream products both GADD45β and c-jun mRNA were reduced in COPD patients while c-myc was not different from controls. No parameter correlated with physiological data within the patient group.

Strong correlations (r[interquartile range, IQR]) were found between treadmill walking intensity (WI: range 0.8-2.0 ms(-2)) and oxygen consumption (0.95 [IQR 0.87-0.97]), (range 7.6-15.5 ml kg(-1)min(-1)); minute ventilation (0.95 [IQR 0.86-0.98]), (range 20-37 l min(-1)); cardiac output (0.89 [IQR 0.73-0.94]), (range 6.8-11.5 l min(-1)) and arteriovenous oxygen concentration difference (0.84 [IQR 0.76-0.90]), (range 7.7-12.1 ml O2100 ml(-1)).

            "abstract": "Objective.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent chronic condition. COPD is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs globally. Spirometry is the gold standard test for a definitive diagnosis and severity grading of COPD. However, a large proportion of individuals with COPD are undiagnosed and untreated. Given the high prevalence of COPD and its clinical importance, it is critical to develop new algorithms to identify undiagnosed COPD. This is particularly true in specific disease groups in which the presence of concomitant COPD increases overall morbidity/mortality such as those with sleep-disordered breathing. To our knowledge, no research has looked at the feasibility of automated COPD diagnosis using a data-driven analysis of the nocturnal continuous oximetry time series. We hypothesize that patients with COPD will exert certain patterns and/or dynamics of their overnight oximetry time series that are unique to this condition and that may be captured using a data-driven approach.Approach.We introduce a novel approach to nocturnal COPD diagnosis using 44 oximetry digital biomarkers and five demographic features and assess its performance in a population sample at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. A total ofn=350 unique patients' polysomnography (PSG) recordings were used. A random forest (RF) classifier was trained using these features and evaluated using nested cross-validation.Main results.The RF classifier obtainedF1 = 0.86 ± 0.02 and AUROC = 0.93 ± 0.02 on the test sets. A total of 8 COPD individuals out of 70 were misclassified. No severe cases (GOLD 3-4) were misdiagnosed. Including additional non-oximetry derived PSG biomarkers resulted in minimal performance increase.Significance.We demonstrated for the first time, the feasibility of COPD diagnosis from nocturnal oximetry time series for a population sample at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. We also highlighted what set of digital oximetry biomarkers best reflect how COPD manifests overnight. The results motivate that overnight single channel oximetry can be a valuable modality for COPD diagnosis, in a population sample at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Further data is needed to validate this approach on other population samples."

In contrast to self-reported measures, wearable accelerometers can provide more precise and reproducible activity quantification.

We correct for multiplicity at a false discovery rate of 1%. We perform analogous testing using self-reported MVPA. Among 96,244 adults wearing accelerometers for one week (age 62 ± 8 years), MVPA is associated with 373 (54%) tested diseases over a median 6.3 years of follow-up. Greater MVPA is overwhelmingly associated with lower disease risk (98% of associations) with hazard ratios (HRs) ranging 0.70-0.98 per 150 min increase in weekly MVPA, and associations spanning all 16 disease categories tested. Overall, associations with lower disease risk are enriched for cardiac (16%), digestive (14%), endocrine/metabolic (10%), and respiratory conditions (8%) (chi-square p < 0.01). Similar patterns are observed using the guideline-based threshold of ≥150 MVPA min/week. Some of the strongest associations with guideline-adherent activity include lower risks of incident heart failure (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55-0.77), type 2 diabetes (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.58-0.71), cholelithiasis (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54-0.70), and chronic bronchitis (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33-0.54). When assessed within 456,374 individuals providing self-reported MVPA, effect sizes for guideline-adherent activity are substantially smaller (e.g., heart failure HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.80-0.88). Greater wearable device-based physical activity is robustly associated with lower disease incidence.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      COPD is characterized by variability in exercise capacity and physical activity (PA), and acute exacerbations (AEs). Little is known about the relationship between daily step count, a direct measure of PA, and the risk of AEs, including hospitalizations.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In an observational cohort study of 169 persons with COPD, we directly assessed PA with the StepWatch Activity Monitor, an ankle-worn accelerometer that measures daily step count. We also assessed exercise capacity with the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and patient-reported PA with the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire Activity Score (SGRQ-AS). AEs and COPD-related hospitalizations were assessed and validated prospectively over a median of 16 months.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Mean daily step count was 5804±3141 steps. Over 209 person-years of observation, there were 263 AEs (incidence rate 1.3±1.6 per person-year) and 116 COPD-related hospitalizations (incidence rate 0.56±1.09 per person-year). Adjusting for FEV1 % predicted and prednisone use for AE in previous year, for each 1000 fewer steps per day walked at baseline, there was an increased rate of AEs (rate ratio 1.07; 95%CI = 1.003-1.15) and COPD-related hospitalizations (rate ratio 1.24; 95%CI = 1.08-1.42). There was a significant linear trend of decreasing daily step count by quartiles and increasing rate ratios for AEs (P = 0.008) and COPD-related hospitalizations (P = 0.003). Each 30-meter decrease in 6MWT distance was associated with an increased rate ratio of 1.07 (95%CI = 1.01-1.14) for AEs and 1.18 (95%CI = 1.07-1.30) for COPD-related hospitalizations. Worsening of SGRQ-AS by 4 points was associated with an increased rate ratio of 1.05 (95%CI = 1.01-1.09) for AEs and 1.10 (95%CI = 1.02-1.17) for COPD-related hospitalizations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Lower daily step count, lower 6MWT distance, and worse SGRQ-AS predict future AEs and COPD-related hospitalizations, independent of pulmonary function and previous AE history. These results support the importance of assessing PA in patients with COPD, and provide the rationale to promote PA as part of exacerbation-prevention strategies."

            "abstract": "This chapter addresses the use of long-term non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) (to the exclusion of continuous positive airway pressure) in the different clinical settings in which it is currently proposed: principally in diseases responsible for hypoventilation characterized by elevated PaCO(2). Nasal masks are predominantly used, followed by nasal pillow and facial masks. Mouthpieces are essentially indicated in case daytime ventilation is needed. Many clinicians currently prefer pressure-preset ventilator in assist mode as the first choice for the majority of the patients with the view of offering better synchronization. Nevertheless, assist-control mode with volume-preset ventilator is also efficient. The settings of the ventilator must insure adequate ventilation assessed by continuous nocturnal records of at least oxygen saturation of haemoglobin-measured by pulse oximetry. The main categories of relevant diseases include different types of neuromuscular disorders, chest-wall deformities and even lung diseases. Depending on the underlying diseases and on individual cases, two schematic situations may be individualized. Either intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) is continuously mandatory to avoid death in the case of complete or quasi-complete paralysis or is used every day for several hours, typically during sleep, producing enough improvement to allow free time during the daylight in spontaneous breathing while hypoventilation and related symptoms are improved. In case of complete or quasi-complete need of mechanical assistance, a tracheostomy may become an alternative to non-invasive access. In neuromuscular diseases, in kyphosis and in sequela of tuberculosis patients, NIPPV always significantly increases survival. Conversely, no data support a positive effect on survival in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

            "abstract": "Nocturnal hypoxemia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are common comorbidities in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The authors sought to develop a strategy to interpret nocturnal pulse oximetry and assess its capacity for detection of OSA in patients with stage 3 to stage 4 COPD. A review of consecutive patients with COPD who were clinically prescribed oximetry and polysomnography was conducted. OSA was diagnosed if the polysomnographic apnea-hypopnea index was >15 events⁄h. Comprehensive criteria were developed for interpretation of pulse oximetry tracings through iterative validation and interscorer concordance of ≥80%. Criteria consisted of visually identified desaturation 'events' (sustained desaturation ≥4%, 1 h time scale), 'patterns' (≥3 similar desaturation⁄saturation cycles, 15 min time scale) and the automated oxygen desaturation index. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated. Of 59 patients (27 male), 31 had OSA (53%). The mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s was 46% of predicted (range 21% to 74% of predicted) and 52% of patients were on long-term oxygen therapy. Among 59 patients, 35 were correctly identified as having OSA or not having OSA, corresponding to an accuracy of 59%, with a sensitivity and specificity of 59% and 60%, respectively. The AUC was 0.57 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.59). Using software-computed desaturation events (hypoxemia ≥4% for ≥10 s) indexed at ≥15 events⁄h of sleep as diagnostic criteria, sensitivity was 60%, specificity was 63% and the AUC was 0.64 (95%CI 0.62 to 0.66). No single criterion demonstrated important diagnostic utility. Pulse oximetry tracing interpretation had a modest diagnostic value in identifying OSA in patients with moderate to severe COPD."

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (via EMBASE.com), In-Process MEDLINE and PubMed unique content (via PubMed.gov), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for systematic reviews or controlled trials. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing studies. We assessed risk of bias and extracted data on health outcomes, surrogate outcomes, usability, sustainability, cost-effectiveness outcomes (quantifying the tradeoffs between health effects and cost), process outcomes, and other characteristics related to PGHD technologies. For isolated effects on health outcomes, we classified the results in one of four categories: (1) likely no effect, (2) unclear, (3) possible positive effect, or (4) likely positive effect. When we categorized the data as “unclear” based solely on health outcomes, we then examined and classified surrogate outcomes for that particular clinical condition.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      We identified 114 unique studies that met inclusion criteria. The largest number of studies addressed patients with hypertension (51 studies) and obesity (43 studies). Eighty-four trials used a single PGHD device, 23 used 2 PGHD devices, and the other 7 used 3 or more PGHD devices. Pedometers, blood pressure (BP) monitors, and scales were commonly used in the same studies. Overall, we found a “possible positive effect” of PGHD interventions on health outcomes for coronary artery disease, heart failure, and asthma. For obesity, we rated the health outcomes as unclear, and the surrogate outcomes (body mass index/weight) as likely no effect. For hypertension, we rated the health outcomes as unclear, and the surrogate outcomes (systolic BP/diastolic BP) as possible positive effect. For cardiac arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities we rated the health outcomes as unclear and the surrogate outcome (time to arrhythmia detection) as likely positive effect. The findings were “unclear” regarding PGHD interventions for diabetes prevention, sleep apnea, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most studies did not report harms related to PGHD interventions; the relatively few harms reported were minor and transient, with event rates usually comparable to harms in the control groups. Few studies reported cost-effectiveness analyses, and only for PGHD interventions for hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the findings were variable across different chronic conditions and devices. Patient adherence to PGHD interventions was highly variable across studies, but patient acceptance/satisfaction and usability was generally fair to good. However, device engineers independently evaluated consumer wearable and handheld BP monitors and considered the user experience to be poor, while their assessment of smartphone-based electrocardiogram monitors found the user experience to be good. Student volunteers involved in device usability testing of the Weight Watchers Online app found it well-designed and relatively easy to use.\n    \n\n\n          Implications:\n        \n      \n      Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated some PGHD technologies (e.g., pedometers, scales, BP monitors), particularly for obesity and hypertension, but health outcomes were generally underreported. We found evidence suggesting a possible positive effect of PGHD interventions on health outcomes for four chronic conditions. Lack of reporting of health outcomes and insufficient statistical power to assess these outcomes were the main reasons for “unclear” ratings. The majority of studies on PGHD technologies still focus on non-health-related outcomes. Future RCTs should focus on measurement of health outcomes. Furthermore,future RCTs should be designed to isolate the effect of the PGHD intervention from other components in a multicomponent intervention."

Meta-analyses showed that physical activity interventions had an overall positive effect on steps per day (mean difference (MD) 1588, 95% CI 399-2778; p=0.009, I2=23), asthma control (MD -0.65, 95% CI -0.95--0.35; p<0.0001, I2=0%) and HRQoL (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.10-1.01; p=0.02, I2=16%) compared to control.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      While there is some evidence supporting the effectiveness of interventions in improving physical activity in adults with severe asthma, higher-quality, large-scale studies of longer duration are needed to determine the optimal intervention."

            "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is defined as bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles with energy expenditure beyond resting levels. PA is closely related to reduced morbidity and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Self-report questionnaires are often subject to recall bias, correlating poorly with objectively qualified PA, and do not provide an accurate estimate of free-living energy expenditure. PA may be objectively evaluated by newly developed tri-axial accelerometers by quantifying steps or body movements over a period of time. Low-intensity, home-based pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) using pedometer feedback improves PA. Improvement in physiological factors correlates with increased walking time in stable elderly COPD patients. This review focuses on the effects of PR and pharmacological treatment on PA in COPD patients. We selected 32 studies from our literature search evaluating the effects of PR and 11 studies examining the effects of pharmacological treatment on PA. Findings in both categories were inconsistent. Nineteen studies showed a positive effect with PR whereas 13 showed no effect. Eight studies showed a positive effect, while three revealed no effect from pharmacological intervention. As both interventions increase exercise capacity without a consistent effect on PA, counseling with behavioral changes may be necessary to achieve a significant and lasting increase in PA. Changing PA behavior in COPD patients requires an interdisciplinary approach involving specialists in respiratory medicine, rehabilitation, social, and behavioral sciences. Future research in this area is warranted to advance our knowledge in this area, specifically with regard to the interaction of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions."

There are no doubts as to its effectiveness in the treatment of acute and respiratory failure in different clinical scenarios. However, the dosing guidelines for oxygen therapy are not as strict as for other treatments. The use of higher than necessary flows over excessively long periods, derived from the clinician's perception of it as a 'life-saving treatment with few side effects', has led to a rather liberal use of this intervention, despite evidence that overuse and suboptimal adjustment can be harmful. The titration of oxygen therapy, which is traditionally performed manually, has been shown to be beneficial. Recently, new devices have been developed that automatically adjust oxygen flow rates to the needs of each patient, in order to maintain stable oxygen saturation levels. These closed-loop oxygen supply systems can potentially reduce medical error, improve morbidity and mortality, and reduce care costs. Familiarizing the medical community with these technological advances will improve awareness of the risks of the inappropriate use of oxygen therapy. The aim of this paper is to provide an update of recent developments in oxygen therapy titration."

Oxygen was administered using a non-rebreathing mask with an oxygen reservoir bag attached. For fear of removing the hypoxic stimulus to respiration the oxygen flow was inappropriately limited to 4L/minute.

Moreover, the risk of carbon dioxide rebreathing dramatically increases if the flow of oxygen to a non-rebreathing mask is lower than the minute ventilation, especially in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and low tidal volumes. Non-rebreathing masks (with oxygen reservoir bags) must be used cautiously by experienced medical staff and with an appropriately high oxygen flow of 10-15 L/minute. Nevertheless, arterial blood gases must be analyzed regularly for early detection of a rise in partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ﻿and a hypoxic ventilatory drive. These patients are more safely managed using a nasal cannula with an oxygen flow of 1-2L/minute or a simple face mask with an oxygen flow of 5L/minute."

            "abstract": "Oxygen is necessary for all aerobic life, and nothing is more important in respiratory care than its proper understanding, assessment, and administration. By the early 1970s P(aO(2)) had become the gold standard for clinically assessing oxygenation in the body. Since the 1980s the measurement of arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry has also been increasingly used as an adjunct to (but not a replacement for) P(aO(2)). Despite the desirability of measuring tissue oxygenation directly, no reliable and clinically relevant such measure has emerged. The 2 areas in which oxygen has proven most important in respiratory care are long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) and the management of potentially life-threatening hypoxemia in acute respiratory failure. That LTOT improves survival in appropriately selected patients with COPD was demonstrated by multicenter studies published more than 30 years ago, and their original selection criteria have so far not been improved upon. Severe hypoxemia in acute lung injury and ARDS can be improved by ventilation with PEEP, and also in many patients by various adjunctive techniques and alternative support strategies. However, the latter measures have not brought clear improvements in survival or other patient-relevant outcomes. In addition, the original goals of \"normalizing\" arterial oxygenation with high tidal volumes and lung-distending pressures have required modification as appreciation for ventilator-related lung injury has emerged. High concentrations of inspired oxygen may play a role in such injury, but aggressive measures to reduce them in order to avoid oxygen toxicity-which dominated ventilator management in previous decades-have been tempered in the present era of lung-protective ventilation. Although some additions and modifications have emerged, much of what we understand today about oxygen in respiratory care is owed to the pioneering work of Thomas L Petty more than 40 years ago."

The goal of this study was to analyse the determinants (obtained in routine practice) of a low 6-min walking distance (6MWD) and exercise-induced desaturation (EID) in COPD, including comorbidities. Methods: Patients were recruited from the real-life French COPD cohort \"Initiatives BPCO\". A low 6MWD was defined as <350 m. EID was defined by a minimum pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2)<90% and delta SpO2≥4% from baseline. Multivariate logistic regression analyses assessed the influence on 6MWD and EID of age, sex, obesity (body mass index, BMI >30 kg/m2), low BMI (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, FEV1% pred, FVC % pred, hyperinflation and comorbidities including cardiovascular diseases. Results: Among 440 patients with available 6MWT data, a 6MWD <350 m was found in 146 patients (33%), which was positively associated in multivariate analyses with age and mMRC and negatively with resting SpO2 and FVC % pred (rescaled r2=0.34), whereas no comorbidity was associated with a low 6WMD. EID was found in 155 patients (35%). This was positively associated with hypertension and negatively with age, obesity, FEV1% pred and resting SpO2 (rescaled r2=0.37). Conclusion: 6MWD and EID exhibit different determinants in COPD with a minor impact of comorbidities limited to hypertension in EID and to obesity, which was unexpectedly associated with less EID. Other variables including age, routine resting lung function and SpO2 were weakly associated with 6MWD and EID. Altogether, these results suggest that 6MWT performance remains difficult to predict with routine clinical/functional parameters."

Survey Monkey was used to collect data and descriptive statistical analysis was undertaken for quantitative data, while thematic content analysis techniques were utilized to analyze qualitative data.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 104 respondents participated in the survey and of these, 76.9% (80/104) were primary care health workers, 16.3% (17/104) specialist clinicians and 6.7% (7/104) healthcare planners. Over 90% of the respondents indicated that more than half of the patients in their clinics presented with respiratory symptoms. More than half (52%) of the primary care health workers were not comfortable in managing chronic respiratory diseases like asthma and COPD. Only 4% of them were comfortable performing procedures like pulse oximetry, nebulization, and interpreting x-rays. Majority (75%) of the primary care health workers had received in-service training but only 4% of the sessions focused on respiratory diseases. The pre-service training curricula included a wide scope of respiratory diseases, but the actual training had not sufficiently prepared health workers to manage respiratory diseases.

Methods A randomised controlled 12-month trial of 42 patients with severe COPD was conducted. Home TM of oximetry, temperature, pulse, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, spirometry, and weight with telephone support and home visits was tested against a control group receiving only identical telephone support and home visits. Results The results suggest that TM had a reduction in COPD-related admissions, emergency department presentations, and hospital bed days. TM also seemed to increase the interval between COPD-related exacerbations requiring a hospital visit and prolonged the time to the first admission. The interval between hospital visits was significantly different between the study arms, while the other findings did not reach significance and only suggest a trend. There was a reduction in hospital admission costs. TM was adopted well by most patients and eventually, also by the nursing staff, though it did not seem to change patients' psychological well-being. Discussion Ability to draw firm conclusions is limited due to the small sample size. However the trends of reducing hospital visits warrant a larger study of a similar design. When designing such a trial, one should consider the potential impact of the high quality of care already made available to this patient cohort."

Recent management guidelines for asthma and COPD recommend regular use of spirometry for the diagnosis and management of these disorders. Because of the development of easy-to-use office-based spirometers, an increasing number of physicians have ready access to spirometry. Beyond simple spirometry, various tests are available from many pulmonary function laboratories for more detailed evaluation of patients with respiratory disorders. For these reasons, all physicians who care for patients with pulmonary disease must understand basic pulmonary function testing and have a fundamental understanding of more sophisticated tests. A series of performance standards has been developed for improved accuracy and precision of pulmonary function tests. Physicians responsible for administering and interpreting pulmonary function tests, even simple spirometry, must be aware of relevant guidelines.

Novel diagnostic tools are needed for accurate symptom discrimination. In this secondary analysis, we examined relationships between baseline assessments of pain, dyspnea, objectively measured PA, and exercise capacity in persons with COPD who previously enrolled in three PA studies. Pain was assessed with the bodily pain domain of the Veterans RAND-36 (VR-36), and dyspnea with the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale. Average daily step count was assessed with the Omron HJ-720ITC or FitBit Zip pedometer, and exercise capacity with 6-minute walk test (6MWT). We also conducted a pilot neuroimaging study. Neuroimaging data were acquired on a Siemens 3-Tesla Magnetom Prismafit whole-body scanner. Analysis of variance assessed trends in daily step count and 6MWT distance across categories of co-occurring pain and dyspnea. General linear models examined relationships between cortical thickness and resting state functional connectivity (fc) with symptoms and functional status. In 373 Veterans, 98% were male with mean age 70.5± 8.3 years and FEV1% predicted 59 ± 21%. Compared to those with no co-occurrence of pain and dyspnea, those with co-occurrence walked 1,291-1,444 fewer steps per day and had an 80-85 m lower 6MWT distance. Ten males participated in the pilot neuroimaging study. Predominant findings were that lower cortical thickness and greater fc were associated with higher pain and dyspnea, p<0.05. Greater cortical thickness and lower fc were associated with higher daily step count and 6MWT distance, p<0.05. Regional patterns of associations differed for pain and dyspnea, suggesting that cortical thickness and fc may discriminate symptoms. Co-occurring dyspnea and pain in COPD are associated with significant reductions in PA and exercise capacity. It may be feasible for neuroimaging markers to discriminate between pain and dyspnea."

The challenge of establishing equivalence between continuous flow oxygen and nominal pulse flow settings on different POCs is well known.

A test lung simulated 3 breathing patterns representative of a patient with COPD at rest, during exercise, and while asleep. POCs were tested for each breathing pattern at all integer pulse flow settings. Volume-averaged FIO2 was calculated by analyzing oxygen concentrations and inhalation flow over time. In vitro oxygen waveforms were then combined with a single-path mathematical model of the lungs to assess oxygen transport through the conducting airways.

Simulations showed that efficiency of delivery to the acinar region of the lungs was higher in pulse flow than in continuous flow oxygen but that continuous flow oxygen generally delivered a higher absolute volume of oxygen. Differences in absolute oxygen delivery per breath between continuous flow oxygen and pulse flow were smaller for acinar delivery than for tracheal delivery.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Significant differences in POC performance based on volume-averaged FIO2 were found between pulse flow and continuous flow oxygen, and among pulse flow modes in different POCs.

It is therefore of interest to assess level of activity and to determine whether interventions are capable of altering activities of daily life. Questionnaires are often employed because of their simplicity, but objective measures are sought. Long-term assessment of energy expenditure, either through doubly labeled water analysis or through measurements of expired gases are expensive and often impractical. Activity monitors include pedometers, heart rate monitors, accelerometers and integrated multisensor systems. Rapidly advancing activity monitor technology has enabled long-term use and facilitated downloading of recordings to computers where sophisticated analysis of activity patterns can be made. Accelerometer-based systems have received the most attention. When applied to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, accelerometric monitors have demonstrated low levels of activity; those using long-term oxygen and those having exacerbations are particularly inactive."

The study was prospective in nature, had full ethical approval and was performed in the Respiratory Department of a city teaching hospital. Thirty-three patients [mean (SD) age 67.2 (9) years] with stable COPD [mean (SD) FEV1 36.8 (11.0)% pred.] were recruited via the respiratory outpatient clinics and through the respiratory wards. The following parameters were measured: daytime arterial blood gases; spirometry; lung volumes (helium dilution); single breath CO transfer factor (TLCO and KCO); maximum inspiratory (IMP) and expiratory mouth pressures; pulse oximetry (SpO2) across a 6-min walk test, and SpO2 during sleep. Seventeen patients who experienced nocturnal desaturation had significantly lower mean PaO2 and SaO2, and higher PaCO2 values compared to non-desaturators. There was a positive correlation between mean nocturnal SpO2 and daytime PaO2, SaO2, and minimum exercise SpO2, and a negative correlation between mean nocturnal SpO2 and PaCO2, and FRC. Regression analysis revealed that daytime SaO2 was the only independent predictor of mean nocturnal saturation (accounting for 61% of the variability in the mean nocturnal SpO2). We observed nocturnal desaturation in all patients with a daytime SaO2 < or = 93% but in no patient with SaO2 > or = 95%. We conclude that daytime SaO2 can be used to predict nocturnal desaturation in normoxic or mildly hypoxic patients with stable COPD. Nocturnal desaturation is likely in patients with COPD where daytime SaO2 < or = 93%, and unlikely where daytime SaO2 > or = 95%."

We hypothesized that a loss of oxidative phenotype (oxphen) associated with decreased endurance is present in the skeletal muscle of patients with mild-to-moderate COPD. In quadriceps muscle biopsies from 29 patients with COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] 58 ± 16%pred, body mass index [BMI] 26 ± 4 kg/m(2)) and 15 controls (BMI 25 ± 3 kg/m(2)) we assessed fiber type distribution, fiber cross-sectional areas (CSA), oxidative and glycolytic gene expression, OXPHOS protein levels, metabolic enzyme activity, and levels of oxidative stress markers. Quadriceps function was assessed by isokinetic dynamometry, body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, exercise capacity by an incremental load test, and physical activity level by accelerometry. Compared with controls, patients had comparable fat-free mass index, quadriceps strength, and fiber CSA, but quadriceps endurance was decreased by 29% (P = 0.002). Patients with COPD had a clear loss of muscle oxphen: a fiber type I-to-II shift, decreased levels of OXPHOS complexes IV and V subunits (47% and 31%, respectively; P < 0.05), a decreased ratio of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme activities (38%, P < 0.05), and decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (40%; P < 0.001) vs. increased PFK (67%; P < 0.001) gene expression levels. Within the patient group, markers of oxphen were significantly positively correlated with quadriceps endurance and inversely with the increase in plasma lactate relative to work rate during the incremental test. Levels of protein carbonylation, tyrosine nitration, and malondialdehyde protein adducts were comparable between patients and controls. However, among patients, oxidative stress levels were significantly inversely correlated with markers of oxphen and quadriceps endurance. Reduced muscle endurance associated with underlying loss of muscle oxphen is already present in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD without muscle wasting."

            "abstract": "The control of breathing in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follows the same basic principles as in normal subjects, both awake and asleep, with an expected lower feedback response during sleep. This impacts nocturnal gas exchange and sleep quality most profoundly in patients with more severe COPD, as multiple factors come into play. Hypoventilation causes the most important gas-exchange alteration in COPD patients, leading to hypercapnia and hypoxemia, especially during rapid-eye-movement sleep, when marked respiratory muscle atonia occurs. The hypoxia leads to increased arousals, sleep disruption, pulmonary hypertension, and higher mortality. The primary mechanisms for this include decreased ventilatory responsiveness to hypercapnia, reduced respiratory muscle output, and marked increases in upper airway resistance. In the presence of more profound daytime hypercapnia, polysomnography should be considered (over nocturnal pulse oximetry) to rule out other co-existing sleep-related breathing disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (overlap syndrome) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Present consensus guidelines provide insight into the proper use of oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure, and nocturnal noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation for those conditions, but several issues remain contentious. In order to provide optimal therapy to patients, the clinician must take into account certain reimbursement and implementation-process obstacles and the guidelines for treatment and coverage criteria."

This was a randomized, single-blind clinical trial conducted at two university hospitals in Granada, Spain. Forty-nine patients hospitalized due to AECOPD were randomly allocated to a control group (CG), in which patients received standard care, or to an intervention group (IG), in which patients were included in a multimodal therapeutic program, added to the standard care. The main outcome measures were pulmonary, physical (strength and exercise capacity) and perceived (dyspnea, quality of life and psychological distress) variables. Within-group significant improvements (p < 0.05) were found in physical and perceived variables in the IG after the treatment. In the CG, a significant decrease was found in lower limb strength and a significant improvement in dyspnea and in three subscales of the EuroQol-5D questionnaire. The between-groups analysis showed significant differences after the treatment on lower limb strength and exercise capacity values (p < 0.05), in three of the EuroQol-5D subscales, and in the total score and the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A multimodal therapeutic program has a beneficial effect on physical functioning and perceived variables in hospitalized obese patients with AECOPD."

            "abstract": "This paper draws on Elias's sociology of knowledge to provide a critical assessment of illness narratives. Focusing on a cohort of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (n = 26), the paper employs a comparative analysis of mixed method data derived from qualitative interviews, quantitative questionnaires, and physiological and accelerometer testing. The article firstly compares four narratives conveyed in interviews with the broader paradigmatic approach to illness narratives and existing COPD-specific studies. It then explores the relationship between these 'stories' and COPD patients' biographical contingencies (e.g. age, wealth, context of diagnosis) and embodied condition (e.g. co-morbidities, lung function), demonstrating how illness narratives are shaped by both broader social structural factors and embodied experience. Invoking Elias we further find that different narrative subthemes are varyingly affected by patients' emotional engagement and ontological security and thus that people are differently enabled or constrained to present illness narratives that are consistent with their broader social and physical condition. Consequently, while narratives, social structure and embodied experience are interdependent, our reading of 'truth' must be sensitive to the social positioning of the 'teller' and the specific content being relayed. The paper therefore presents a more systematic, comparative, bio-psycho-social analysis than has hitherto been produced."

We defined four activity categories: Walking, Slow-Intermittent-Walking (SIW), Active-Not-Walking (ANW), and Rest. We quantified oxygen desaturation during activity using a desaturation index (DSI = % time oxygen saturation <90%). BODE scores were categorized into three groups: group I (0-3), II (4-6), and III (7-10).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The percentage of patients demonstrating oxygen desaturation (DSI ≥ 10%) during each activity was 55% for Walking, 35% for SIW, 15% for ANW, and 28% for Rest. There was a strong association between BODE score and desaturation for Walking and SIW. During Walking, 21, 44, and 86% of patients in BODE groups I, II, and III, respectively, demonstrated desaturation. The DSI for Walking and SIW was increased in patients in BODE groups II and III compared to group I (P < 0.006, P < 0.007, respectively). BODE score was also linked to long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) usage; the majority of patients not on LTOT (89%) had a BODE score <7. The majority of patients on LTOT (84%) demonstrated desaturation during Walking, but 42% of patients not on LTOT also demonstrated desaturation. In this subgroup of patients not on LTOT, all patients with a BODE score ≥ 7 demonstrated desaturation during Walking.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The link between the BODE index and oxygen desaturation during daily activities suggests that desaturation is linked to disease severity. Our data suggest that patients with a BODE score ≥ 7 should be evaluated for desaturation during daily activities. Use of the BODE index to screen for exertional desaturation may have value as a tool that can lead to the earlier identification of patients who may be candidates for LTOT."

These devices can provide objective and quantifiable measures of physical activity, which are not subject to errors or bias of self-reporting or shorter duration of formal testing. Prior work on so-called quantified-self data was based on older-generation, research-grade accelerometers, which laid the foundation for consumer-based physical activity monitoring devices to be validated as a feasible and reliable tool in patients with cancer. Physical activity monitors are being used in chronic conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Differing demographics, compounded with higher symptom and treatment burdens in patients with cancer, imply that additional work is needed to understand the unique strengths and weaknesses of physical activity monitors in this population. Oncology programs can systematically implement these tools into their workflows in an adaptable and iterative manner. Translating large amounts of data collected from an individual physical activity monitoring device into clinically relevant information requires sophisticated data compilation and reduction. In this article, we summarize the characteristics of older- and newer-generation physical activity monitors, review the validation of physical activity monitors with respect to health-related quality-of-life assessments, and describe the current role of these devices for the practicing oncologist. We also highlight the challenges and next steps needed for physical activity monitors to provide relevant information that can change the current state of oncology practice."

The present study tested the hypothesis in patients with COPD staying overnight at high altitude that nocturnal arterial hypoxaemia is associated with impaired cerebral tissue oxygenation (CTO). A total of 35 patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, living at <800 m (mean [SD] age 62.4 [12.3] years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1 ] 61 [16]% predicted, awake pulse oximetry ≥92%) underwent continuous overnight monitoring of pulse oximetry (oxygen saturation [SpO2 ]) and near-infrared spectroscopy of prefrontal CTO, respectively, at 490 m and 2,590 m. Regression analysis was used to evaluate whether nocturnal arterial desaturation (COPDDesat , SpO2 <90% for >30% of night-time) at 490 m predicted CTO at 2,590 m when controlling for baseline variables. At 2,590 m, mean nocturnal SpO2 and CTO were decreased versus 490 m, mean change -8.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] -10.0 to -7.6) and -3.6% (95% CI -5.7 to -1.6), difference in change ΔCTO-ΔSpO2 5.2% (95% CI 3.0 to 7.3; p < .001). Moreover, frequent cyclic desaturations (≥4% dips/hr) occurred in SpO2 and CTO, mean change from 490 m 35.3/hr (95% CI 24.9 to 45.7) and 3.4/hr (95% CI 1.4 to 5.3), difference in change ΔCTO-ΔSpO2 -32.8/hr (95% CI -43.8 to -21.8; p < .001). Regression analysis confirmed an association of COPDDesat with lower CTO at 2,590 m (coefficient -7.6%, 95% CI -13.2 to -2.0; p = .007) when controlling for several confounders. We conclude that lowlanders with COPD staying overnight at 2,590 m experience altitude-induced hypoxaemia and periodic breathing in association with sustained and intermittent cerebral deoxygenation. Although less pronounced than the arterial deoxygenation, the altitude-induced cerebral tissue deoxygenation may represent a risk of brain dysfunction, especially in patients with COPD with nocturnal hypoxaemia at low altitude."

Thirty outpatients with stable COPD underwent lung function measurements, blood gas analysis, ECG Holter and transcutaneous pulse oximetry during 6mWT and then they were classified by BODE index. Also C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured. At rest, we observed a significant reduction of HRV for increasing BODE index. During the 6mWT, HRV tended to decrease in BODE 1 subjects whereas an increase was observed in BODE 2 and BODE 3-4 subjects. Subjects with elevated CRP values had a significant reduction in Standard Deviation of all normal RR intervals at rest (SDNN: p = 0.013), Total Power (TFA: p = 0.04) and Very Low Frequency band (VLF: p = 0.041).

            "abstract": "Heart rate variability (HRV) is measured to analyze autonomic nervous system function in humans, and pulse rate variability (PRV) assessed using the photoplethysmography method with a pulse oximeter has been proposed as a surrogate for HRV. To examine whether PRV is compatible with HRV in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we simultaneously measured HRV with an electrocardiogram and PRV with a pulse oximeter in patients with COPD, and compared low-frequency and high-frequency components computed from HRV and PRV as indicators of autonomic nervous system function. In a Bland-Altman analysis, the low-frequency component computed from HRV exhibited good consistency with that computed from PRV. The high-frequency component showed a significant fixed error but relatively good consistency. Our results indicate that autonomic nervous system function may be estimated with the low-frequency component by measuring PRV with a pulse oximeter in patients with COPD."
