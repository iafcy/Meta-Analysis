            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nEarlier detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations may facilitate more rapid treatment with reduced risk of hospitalization. Changes in pulse oximetry may permit early detection of exacerbations. We hypothesized that overnight pulse oximetry would be superior to once-daily monitoring for the early detection of exacerbations.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study aims to evaluate whether measuring changes in heart rate and oxygen saturation overnight is superior to once-daily monitoring of both parameters and to assess symptom changes in facilitating earlier detection of COPD exacerbations.\n## METHODS\nA total of 83 patients with COPD were randomized to once-daily or overnight pulse oximetry. Both groups completed the COPD assessment test questionnaire daily. The baseline mean and SD for each pulse oximetry variable were calculated from 14 days of stable monitoring. Changes in exacerbation were expressed as Z scores from this baseline.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean age of the patients was 70.6 (SD 8.1) years, 52% (43/83) were female, and the mean FEV1 was 53.0% (SD 18.5%) predicted. Of the 83 patients, 27 experienced an exacerbation. Symptoms were significantly elevated above baseline from 5 days before to 12 days after treatment initiation. Day-to-day variation in pulse oximetry during the stable state was significantly less in the overnight group than in the once-daily group. There were greater relative changes at exacerbation in heart rate than oxygen saturation. An overnight composite score of change in heart rate and oxygen saturation changed significantly from 7 days before initiation of treatment for exacerbation and had a positive predictive value for exacerbation of 91.2%. However, this was not statistically better than examining changes in symptoms alone.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOvernight pulse oximetry permits earlier detection of COPD exacerbations compared with once-daily monitoring. Monitoring physiological variables was not superior to monitoring symptoms, and the latter would be a simpler approach, except where there is a need for objective verification of exacerbations.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT03003702; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03003702.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly prevalent and significantly affects the daily functioning of patients. Self-management strategies, including increasing physical activity, can help people with COPD have better health and a better quality of life. Digital mobile health (mHealth) techniques have the potential to aid the delivery of self-management interventions for COPD. We developed an mHealth intervention (Self-Management supported by Assistive, Rehabilitative, and Telehealth technologies-COPD [SMART-COPD]), delivered via a smartphone app and an activity tracker, to help people with COPD maintain (or increase) physical activity after undertaking pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of using the SMART-COPD intervention for the self-management of physical activity and to explore the feasibility of conducting a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate its effectiveness.\n## METHODS\nWe conducted a randomized feasibility study. A total of 30 participants with COPD were randomly allocated to receive the SMART-COPD intervention (n=19) or control (n=11). Participants used SMART-COPD throughout PR and for 8 weeks afterward (ie, maintenance) to set physical activity goals and monitor their progress. Questionnaire-based and physical activity-based outcome measures were taken at baseline, the end of PR, and the end of maintenance. Participants, and health care professionals involved in PR delivery, were interviewed about their experiences with the technology.\n## RESULTS\nOverall, 47% (14/30) of participants withdrew from the study. Difficulty in using the technology was a common reason for withdrawal. Participants who completed the study had better baseline health and more prior experience with digital technology, compared with participants who withdrew. Participants who completed the study were generally positive about the technology and found it easy to use. Some participants felt their health had benefitted from using the technology and that it assisted them in achieving physical activity goals. Activity tracking and self-reporting were both found to be problematic as outcome measures of physical activity for this study. There was dissatisfaction among some control group members regarding their allocation.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nmHealth shows promise in helping people with COPD self-manage their physical activity levels. mHealth interventions for COPD self-management may be more acceptable to people with prior experience of using digital technology and may be more beneficial if used at an earlier stage of COPD. Simplicity and usability were more important for engagement with the SMART-COPD intervention than personalization; therefore, the intervention should be simplified for future use. Future evaluation will require consideration of individual factors and their effect on mHealth efficacy and use; within-subject comparison of step count values; and an opportunity for control group participants to use the intervention if an RCT were to be carried out. Sample size calculations for a future evaluation would need to consider the high dropout rates.\n",

From 0 to 15 months no differences were found in physical activity. However, when patients with baseline physical activity>10,000 steps per day (n\u00a0=\u00a08), who are already sufficiently active, were excluded, a significant long-term effect of the counselling programme on daily physical activity existed in the total group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

Home-based options have been proposed and were found noninferior to center-based rehabilitation; however, there is a lack of home-based programs, and more understanding is needed. We aimed to test the feasibility, uptake, and adherence to a home-based program for COPD rehabilitation with health coaching.\n## METHODS\nWe conducted a randomized trial with a wait-list controlled design to evaluate the effects of a home-based program with health coaching on breathlessness in subjects with moderate to severe COPD unable to attend the regular pulmonary rehabilitation program.

Health coaching was done weekly over the telephone to review subject activity and symptoms and to provide an opportunity for the subject to define their weekly goals.

Patients with COPD participated in a 12-week PR program. Daily PA was measured using activity monitors on weeks 1, 7, and 12, and feedback was given in the following weeks on the number of steps, time spent in sedentary, light, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity activities, and time spent standing, sitting, and lying. Compliance with PA monitoring was collected. Two focus groups were conducted to obtain patients' perspectives on the use of activity monitors and on the feedback given. Differences in PA data were also assessed. Sixteen patients (65.63 \u00b1 10.57 years; forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 70.31 \u00b1 22.74% predicted) completed the study. From those, only eleven participants used the activity monitors during all monitoring days. Participants identified several problems regarding the use of activity monitors and monitoring duration. Daily steps (p = 0.026) and standing time (p = 0.030) were improved from week 1 to week 7; however, the former declined from week 7 to week 12. Findings suggest that using feedback to improve PA during PR is feasible and results in improved daily steps and standing time on week 7. The subsequent decline suggests that additional strategies may be needed to stimulate/maintain PA improvements. Further research with more robust designs is needed to investigate the impact of feedback on patients' daily PA.\n",

[Subjects and Methods] 17 outpatients with chronic respiratory disease were assessed for dyspnea, muscle strength, exercise tolerance, ADL, and QOL at baseline, after 3-, and 6-months after the start of the program. Patients were randomly assigned to \"Control\" or \"Diary\" group. In the Diary group, the number of steps was counted with a pedometer and recorded in a diary together with self-evaluation of physical activity, while patients assigned to the Control group did not use a pedometer or keep a diary. [Results] The Diary group showed significant improvement in the daily step count over time. The Diary group showed significant improvement of the dyspnea, muscle strength, and exercise tolerance at 3 months, dyspnea and muscle strength at 6 months. Significant differences found between two groups with regard to the extent of change in the muscle strength, exercise tolerance, and QOL at 3 months. [Conclusion] This study suggests that a self-managed physical activity program using a pedometer and diary can increase the level of physical activity.\n",

Twenty-seven elderly patients with COPD (age 74 \u00b1 8 yrs; %FEV1 56.6 \u00b1 18.7%) participated. They were randomly selected to undergo PR (pulmonary rehabilitation only) or PR + P (PR plus the feedback from using a pedometer). Their PA and pulmonary function, exercise capacity (6-min walking distance; 6MWD), quadriceps femoris muscle force (QF) were evaluated before the PR began (baseline) and at 1 year later. We compared the patients' changes in PA and other factors between the baseline values and those obtained 1 year later and analyzed the relationships between the changes in PA and other factors in the both groups.\n## RESULTS\nThe increase in the time spent walking in the PR + P group (51.3 \u00b1 63.7 min/day) was significantly greater than that of PR group (12.3 \u00b1 25.5 min/day) after the PR. The improvement rate of daily walking time after PR was significantly correlated with that of the 6MWD and QF in all subjects.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese data suggest that low-intensity and home-based PR with the feedback from using pedometer was effective in improving PA, and the improvements of physiological factors were correlated with increased walking time in stable elderly patients with COPD.\n",

            "abstract": "## RATIONALE\nLow physical activity is highly prevalent among COPD patients and is associated with increased healthcare utilization and mortality and reduced HRQL. The addition of a website to pedometer use is effective at increasing physical activity; however, the timeline of change and impact of environmental factors on efficacy is unknown.\n## METHODS\nU.S. Veterans with COPD were randomized (1:1) to receive either (1) a pedometer and website which provided goal-setting, feedback, disease-specific education, and an online community forum or (2) pedometer alone for 3 months. Primary outcome was change in daily step count. Secondary outcomes included 6MWT distance, HRQL, dyspnea, depression, COPD knowledge, exercise self-efficacy, social support, motivation, and confidence to exercise. Generalized linear mixed-effects models evaluated the effect of the pedometer plus website compared to pedometer alone.\n## RESULTS\nData from 109 subjects (98.5% male, mean age 68.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.3 years) were analyzed. At 13 weeks, subjects in the pedometer plus website group had significant increases daily step count from baseline relative to the pedometer alone group (804\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0356.5 steps per day, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). The pedometer plus website group had significant improvements in daily step count from baseline beginning in week 3 which were sustained until week 13. In subgroup analyses, the pedometer plus website attenuated declines in daily step count during the transition from summer to fall. No significant differences in secondary outcomes were noted between groups.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA website added to pedometer use improves daily step counts, sustains walking over 3 months, and attenuates declines in physical activity due to season.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE\nThere are barriers to providing pulmonary rehabilitation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) such as the high number of patients, difficult access to health facilities and high costs of programs. Pedometers can monitor and improve physical activity (PA). The aim of this study was to evaluate benefits and costs of home pedometer assisted PA, as compared to a standard outpatient supervised exercise training program in patients with COPD.\n## METHODS\nPatients were randomly assigned either to home pedometer assisted PA (Group 1), or to a six-week outpatient standard supervised exercise training program (Group 2). Patients of Group 1 had to walk at home for 6 weeks, at least 30min daily at the fastest step pace as possible, to achieve a weekly 10% increase in their average daily steps up to more than 6500. Pre and post programs we assessed: the six minute walking distance (6MWT: primary outcome), daily steps count, the Medical Research Council scale (MRC), the COPD assessment test score, and the BODE index (body-mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, exercise capacity). Costs of programs were also evaluated.\n## RESULTS\nOut of 40 patients, 18 in both groups (mean (standard deviation)) age: 68.3 (6.7) and 61.2 (6.7) years; FEV1: 1.1 (0.5) and 0.9 (0.4) liters in Group 1 and 2 respectively completed the study. At the end of the program 44.5% patients of Group 1 had reached the target daily steps, in 26.6 (9.5) days. Following the programs, both groups showed significant improvements in all outcome measures, except BODE. The home program was cheaper (p=0.0001), with a mean 76.3 euros saving per patient.\n## CONCLUSION\nHome pedometer assisted PA may be a useful and cheaper alternative to outpatient supervised exercise training programs in patients with COPD.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThe World Health Organization has projected that by 2030, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will be the third-leading cause of mortality and the seventh-leading cause of morbidity worldwide. Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are associated with an accelerated decline in lung function, diminished quality of life, and higher mortality. Accurate early detection of acute exacerbations will enable early management and reduce mortality.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this study was to develop a prediction system using lifestyle data, environmental factors, and patient symptoms for the early detection of AECOPD in the upcoming 7 days.\n## METHODS\nThis prospective study was performed at National Taiwan University Hospital. Patients with COPD that did not have a pacemaker and were not pregnant were invited for enrollment. Data on lifestyle, temperature, humidity, and fine particulate matter were collected using wearable devices (Fitbit Versa), a home air quality-sensing device (EDIMAX Airbox), and a smartphone app. AECOPD episodes were evaluated via standardized questionnaires. With these input features, we evaluated the prediction performance of machine learning models, including random forest, decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis, and adaptive boosting, and a deep neural network model.\n## RESULTS\nThe continuous real-time monitoring of lifestyle and indoor environment factors was implemented by integrating home air quality-sensing devices, a smartphone app, and wearable devices. All data from 67 COPD patients were collected prospectively during a mean 4-month follow-up period, resulting in the detection of 25 AECOPD episodes. For 7-day AECOPD prediction, the proposed AECOPD predictive model achieved an accuracy of 92.1%, sensitivity of 94%, and specificity of 90.4%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the area under the curve of the model in predicting AECOPD was greater than 0.9. The most important variables in the model were daily steps walked, stairs climbed, and daily distance moved.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nUsing wearable devices, home air quality-sensing devices, a smartphone app, and supervised prediction algorithms, we achieved excellent power to predict whether a patient would experience AECOPD within the upcoming 7 days. The AECOPD prediction system provided an effective way to collect lifestyle and environmental data, and yielded reliable predictions of future AECOPD events. Compared with previous studies, we have comprehensively improved the performance of the AECOPD prediction model by adding objective lifestyle and environmental data. This model could yield more accurate prediction results for COPD patients than using only questionnaire data.\n",
