CH probands were explicitly described by the study authors as receiving a diagnosis of hydrocephalus. CH-like probands were fetal cases denoted only as receiving a diagnosis of severe cerebral ventriculomegaly, often precluded from a confirmed diagnosis of hydrocephalus due to prenatal constraints.3 Studies that only included cases of mild or moderate ventriculomegaly were not considered suggestive of CH2,21 and were excluded.",
