Abstract 
Background Infantile hydrocephalus (IHC) is commonly related to other central nervous system diseases, which may have 
adverse effects on prognosis. The causes of IHC are heterogeneous, and the genetic etiologies are not fully understood. This 
study aimed to analyze the genetic etiologies of an IHC cohort. 
Methods The data for 110 IHC patients who had received exome sequencing at the Clinical Genetic Center of the Children’s 
Hospital of Fudan University between 2016 and 2019 were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively. An exome-wide associa- 
tion analysis (EWAS) was performed within this cohort using IHC as the study phenotype. 
Results Of the 110 IHC patients, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was identified in 16 (15%) patients, spanning 
13 genes. The genes were mainly associated with metabolic disorders, brain abnormalities, and genetic syndromes. IHC 
patients who had unclear clinical etiology were more likely to possess a genetic etiology. Based on previous studies and 
on our EWAS results, ZEB1, SBF2, and GNAI2 were over-represented among IHC patients and might affect the signaling 
pathways involved in IHC formation. 
Conclusions Our study showed heterogeneous genetic etiologies in an IHC cohort. It is essential to perform genetic testing 
on IHC patients who have unclear clinical etiology, and genes associated with metabolic disorders, brain abnormalities, and 
genetic syndromes should be noted. In addition, when aiming to discover IHC susceptibility genes, genes that might influ- 
ence the signaling pathways involved in IHC formation should be prioritized.

Infantile hydrocephalus (IHC), a neurologic condition 
characterized by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospi- 
nal fluid within the cerebral ventricular system that leads 
to an enlargement of the ventricles or subarachnoid space, 
is reported in approximately 1.1 per 1000 infants [1]. The 
immense impact of IHC on the family and society is clear, 
as it carries a high risk of neurodevelopmental damage and 
high mortality [2, 3]. The pathogenesis of IHC is hetero- 
geneous, and genetic factors play an important part [4]. To 
date, the four most commonly documented hydrocephalus- 
related genes are L1CAM, AP1S2, CCDC88C, and MPDZ 
[5–8], whose disruption leads to diseases with hydrocepha- 
lus being the main or sole clinical characteristic. In most 
instances, hydrocephalus may present as a component of 
certain genetic syndromes with various genes involved [9]. 
Hydrocephalus can be recognized at different ages, which 



 
can be indicative of different underlying etiologies [4], and 
hydrocephalus caused by different means can be associated 
with different outcomes [10]. However, there are little data 
on the genetic causes among IHC patients with different 
onset ages and with different outcomes. In addition, most 
previous studies have focused on evaluating the genetic eti- 
ologies among hydrocephalus patients without a clear extrin- 
sic cause, whereas few studies have investigated the genetic 
etiologies among IHC patients with clear clinical etiologies. 
In this present study, we analyzed a cohort of IHC 
patients who had undergone genetic testing at the Clinical 
Genetic Center of the Children’s Hospital of Fudan Uni- 
versity between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2019. 
In particular, we focused on the genetic findings, and made 
comparisons about the different genetic etiology rates among 
IHC patients with clear or unclear clinical etiologies, dif- 
ferent gestational ages, different onset ages and different 
outcomes to obtain a better understanding of the genetic 
etiologies associated with IHC. 


Patients were recruited from the Children’s Hospital of 
Fudan University between January 1, 2016, and December 
31, 2019, with the following inclusion criteria: (1) a diagno- 
sis of hydrocephalus within the first year of life determined 
by cranial imaging (ultrasound, computed tomography or 
magnetic resonance imaging) and (2) genetic testing at 
the Clinical Genetic Center of the Children’s Hospital of 
Fudan University. Patients who did not meet these criteria or 
declined to participate were excluded from this study. This 
study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Chil- 
dren’s Hospital of Fudan University, and informed consent 
was obtained from all the study participants. 
For each patient, clinical information, laboratory results, 
and cranial imaging findings were obtained through the 
review of medical records. The evaluation of outcomes was 
made at the final follow-up visits, and developmental delays 
were assessed based on the Gesell Developmental Scale. 
Statistical analysis consisted mainly of the Chi-square test 
for comparisons of categorical variables with a threshold of 
P < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. For cells 
with < 5 observations, Fisher’s exact test was applied. Sta- 
tistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0 software. 

Genomic DNA from peripheral blood was extracted using 
the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Ger- 
many) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The Agilent 

ClearSeq Inherited Disease Kit Illumina Cluster (Agi- 
lent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and SBS Kits 
(Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were used for clini- 
cal exome sequencing, whileereas the Agilent SureSelect 
Human All Exon Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, 
CA, USA), Illumina TruSeq Rapid PE Cluster and SBS 
Kits (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were applied for 
whole-exome sequencing. Next-generation sequencing on 
an Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500 platform (Illumina Inc., San 
Diego, CA, USA) was utilized to perform the sequencing. 
Clean reads aligned to the reference human genome (UCSC 
hg19) were generated by discarding low-quality reads from 
raw data. Variant calling was performed using the Genome 
Analysis Tool Kit. ClinVar, online Mendelian inheritance 
in man and the human gene mutation database (professional 
version) for known pathogenic and likely pathogenic vari- 
ants were applied. Numerous missense functional predic- 
tors, noncoding regulatory region annotations, and others 
were used. The allelic frequencies were annotated from the 
1000 genomes, the Exome Sequencing Project (EVS6500), 
the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), and the Kyoto 
and Dutch allelic frequency databases to filter out variants 
of high frequency. 

An exome-wide analysis study (EWAS) was performed 
within this cohort. Informed consent for DNA analysis was 
obtained from the study participants in accordance with the 
time of collection. The details for the sequencing strategy, 
variant filtration, and genetic diagnosis have been published 
previously by our group [11]. 
Strategy to identify over‑represented genes 
and variants in IHC patients 
To screen for possible candidate genes or variants, we 
included another 10,000 patient samples from the Clinical 
Genetic Center of the Children’s Hospital of Fudan Univer- 
sity. The inclusion criteria were as follows: patients under- 
went genetic testing for hyperbilirubinemia or skin prob- 
lems. Patients who underwent genetic testing for any of the 
following conditions and who had any positive genetic find- 
ings were excluded: hydrocephalus, brain malformations, 
brain tumor, arachnoid cyst, or encephalopathy. Because the 
control and case individuals were not matched for age, sex, 
ethnicity or other covariates, we applied a bootstrap strategy 
to avoid possible sample selection bias (n = 1000). For each 
run, we randomly selected 300 control samples for analysis. 
At the variant level, we performed Fisher’s exact tests for 
each candidate to test whether the variant was over-repre- 
sented in case samples. At the gene level, we calculated the 
pathogenicity score for each candidate by summarizing the 

 

REVEL [12] score of the variant and adjusting it to 0–1. For 
genes containing nonsense variants, the score was defined 
as 1. Student’s t test was then performed to test whether the 
pathogenicity score was higher in case samples. When sum- 
marizing the 1000 results, we followed the gene collapsing 
approach [13]. A threshold of P < 0.05 was considered sta- 
tistically significant, and all tests were one-sided. All analy- 
ses were performed using R software (version 3.5.1, http:// 
cran.r- proje ct. org). 
shunt (VP) in eight patients, a third ventriculostomy in two 
patients, an external ventricular drainage (EVD) in two 
patients, an Ommaya reservoir implantation (OMMAYA) 
in one patient and unspecific surgery in three patients. 
Moreover, 18 patients underwent repeated surgeries, includ- 
ing EVD + VP (3 patients), OMMAYA + VP (4 patients), 
OMMAYA + EVD (4 patients), and OMMAYA + EVD + VP 
(7 patients). Another 16 patients refused the surgery 
recommendation. 


A total of 110 infants diagnosed with IHC were enrolled in 
this study (Fig. 1). Overall, 86 (78%) patients had undergone 
clinical exome sequencing, and 24 (22%) patients had under- 
gone whole-exome sequencing. The detailed demographics 
and certain clinical characteristics of the study population 
are summarized in Table 1. Among them, 61 (55%) patients 
were male. The average birth weight was 2239 g, and 40% 
(38/95) of the patients were born at term. Overall, 55% of 
the patients were recommended for surgery, among which 16 
underwent a single surgery, including a ventriculoperitoneal 

The recognizable clinical etiologies of hydrocephalus in 
this cohort are summarized in Fig. 2. A total of 48 (44%, 
48/110) patients had intracranial hemorrhage (IH), includ- 
ing IH alone in 31 (28%, 31/110) patients, IH combined 
with intracranial infection (II) in 14 (13%, 14/110) patients 
and IH combined with brain malformations (BM) in 3 (3%, 
3/110) patients. In addition, II alone occurred in 11 (10%, 
11/110) patients, and BM alone occurred in 8 (7%, 8/110) 
patients. Arachnoid cyst occurred in 2 (2%, 2/110) patients, 
and a tumor occurred in 1 (1%, 1/110) patient. Another 
40 (36%, 40/110) patients had no clear clinical cause. In 
this cohort, IH was the most common clinical etiology of 
hydrocephalus.

Contribution of genetic disorders in infants 
with clear or unclear clinical etiologies 
Overall, 22 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants span- 
ning 13 genes were identified in 16 (15%, 16/110) patients, 
including 12 variants identified by whole-exome sequenc- 
ing in 8 (33.3%, 8/24) patients and 10 variants identified 
by clinical exome sequencing in 8 (9.3%, 8/86) patients. 
The genetic diagnosis rate of whole-exome sequencing 
was significantly higher than clinical exome sequencing 
(P = 0.007). The distribution of genetic etiologies in this 
cohort was as follows: 7 (44%, 7/16) in metabolic disor- 
ders, 5 (31%, 5/16) in genetic syndromes, 3 (19%, 3/16) 
in brain malformations and 1 (6%, 1/16) in myopathy. The 
detailed information for the patients with a genetic etiol- 
ogy is listed in Table 2.

hemorrhage, II intracranial infection, BM brain malformations, AC

IHC infants without a clear clinical etiology accounted 
for 36% (40/110) of all patients included in this study, 
and 11 (28%, 11/40) patients were identified as having a 
genetic etiology. IHC infants with a clear clinical etiol- 
ogy accounted for 64% (70/110) of all cases enrolled in 
this cohort and 5 (7%, 5/70) patients had a genetic etiol- 
ogy. The genetic etiology rates between the patients with 
unclear clinical etiology and the patients with clear clini- 
cal etiologies were significantly different (P = 0.004). 
Distribution of etiologies among preterm patients 
and term patients 
Of the patients in this study, 38 infants were born at term, 
and 57 infants were born preterm. For 15 patients, the 
exact gestational age could not be obtained. The detailed 
clinical and genetic etiology distributions among preterm 
patients and term patients are presented in Table 3. Among 
the patients born at term, approximately half (47%, 18/38) 
did not have a clear clinical etiology. Among the preterm 
patients, only 19% (11/57) did not have a clear clinical etiol- 
ogy; so the clear clinical etiology rate was 81% (46/57), with 
IH (occurring in a total of 35 patients; 61%, 35/57) being the 
most common clinical etiology. Among the patients who had 
unclear clinical etiology, there was no significant difference 
between the genetic etiology rates of the preterm patients 
(0%, 0/11) and the term patients (28%, 5/18) (P = 0.126). In 
contrast, among the patients who had clear clinical etiolo- 
gies, there was a significant difference between the genetic

Distribution of etiologies among the patients 
with different diagnosed ages 
The distribution of age at diagnosis in this study was 22 
(21%, 22/103) during pregnancy, 44 (43%, 44/103) before 
1 month of age, 31 (30%, 31/103) from 1 month (includ- 
ing 1 month) to 6 months and 6 (6%, 6/103) from 6 months 
(including 6 months) to 1 year. Information about age at 
diagnosis was not available for the remaining seven patients. 
The detailed clinical and genetic etiology distributions 
among the patients with different diagnosed ages are given 
in Table 3. The genetic etiology rates among the patients 
with unclear clinical etiology were 25% (2/8) in the “dur- 
ing pregnancy” group, 50% (2/4) in the “ < 1 month” group, 
31% (5/16) in the “1–6 months” group and 17% (1/6) in the 
“6 months–1 year” group. The genetic etiology rates among 
the patients with clear clinical etiologies were 14% (2/14) in 
the “during pregnancy” group, 3% (1/40) in the “ < 1 month” 
group, 13% (2/15) in the “1–6 months” group. There were 
no statistically significant differences in the genetic etiology 
rates among the four groups with unclear clinical etiology 
nor among the three groups with clear clinical etiologies

Distribution of etiologies among patients 
with different outcomes 

We evaluated the outcomes of 69 patients. The outcomes 
of 41 patients could not be determined owing to, limited 
medical record availability in 29 cases and to patients 
rejecting treatment and leaving the hospital when informed 
of the possible poor outcomes in 12 cases. Among the 
69 patients with outcomes were available, 42 (61%, 
42/69) showed developmental delays and 14 had under- 
gone surgeries; 11 (16%, 11/69) patients developed other 
neurological sequelae including seven patients who had 
undergone surgeries; and 7 (10%, 7/69) died including one 
patient who had undergone surgery. Only 9 (13%, 9/69) 
patients improved without any sequelae during follow-up, 
and six of these patients had undergone surgeries. The 
detailed clinical and genetic etiology distributions among 
the patients with different outcomes are shown in Table 3. 
The genetic etiology distribution was as follows: among 
the patients with unclear clinical etiology, there were 6 
(22%, 6/27) patients in the “developmental delay” group, 
1 (50%, 1/2) patients in the “neurological sequelae” group, 
and 1 (33%, 1/3) patient in the “deceased” group among 
the patients with clear clinical etiologies, there were 2 
(13%, 2/15) patients in the “developmental delay” group, 
1 (11%, 1/9) patient in the “neurological sequelae” group, 
1 (11%, 1/9) patient in the “improved” group and zero 
(0%, 0/4) patients in the “deceased” group. Comparative 
analyses in this section were not practicable owing to the 
large number of patients lost to follow-up. 
We detected 18 genes and 31 variants that were over-repre- 
sented in the 110 IHC patients described above (Methods 
section and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Of these 47 
genes, six (NPHP1, FANCL, ERCC4, NME8, ERCC3 and 
DMPK) were annotated as hydrocephalus-related genes 
recorded in DisGeNET [14]. In addition, another three 
genes (ZEB1, SBF2, and GNAI2) also may be related to 
IHC because they are involved in the pathways of hydro- 
cephalus formation (elaborated in the Discussion section). 
The position and encoded proteins of the variants detected 
in ZEB1, SBF2, and GNAI2 are listed in Table 4. 

As a neurological disorder with high morbidity, IHC requires 
early and sometimes multiple neurosurgical interventions 
[15, 16] and can result in marked neurological presentations, 
neurodevelopmental delays or even death [10]. Although 
surgical treatments can alleviate the ventriculomegaly and 
can relieve the increased intraventricular pressure, which 
may cause a crescendo of neurovascular damage further 
compromising the brain development [15, 17], severe prog- 
noses are common among those who have undergone surger- 
ies owing to shunt infection or shunt failure [3, 16]. Among 
the patients who had undergone surgical treatments in our 
study population, only six patients improved without any 
sequelae, whereas 22 patients received severe prognoses.

Because IHC may be caused by various underlying etiolo- 
gies [18], including genetic causes that remain incompletely 
understood, we performed a retrospective study focused on 
the genetic landscape of IHC and discovered a total of 16 
(15%, 16/110) IHC patients with a genetic etiology. The 
genetic factors associated with IHC are heterogeneous [19]. 
Among the 16 patients with a genetic finding in this study, 
variations in genes associated with metabolic disorders were 
most common. In 2018, a study reported ten patients with 
metabolic disorders who were not diagnosed until hydro- 
cephalus had developed [20]. If those patients had received 
an earlier diagnosis through genetic testing and had been 
provided with early, precise intervention, the hydrocephalus 
may not have developed. The second most common class of 
mutated genes found in our study was genetic syndrome- 
related genes. In a large proportion of patients, IHC was 
merely a symptom of various syndromes. Paying attention to 
the concomitant abnormalities and actively adopting genetic 
testing will facilitate identification of the underlying cause 
of hydrocephalus. The third most common identified gene 
class included genes responsible for causing brain malforma- 
tions. A combination of brain imaging and genetic testing 
will make it possible to reveal the brain abnormalities and 
the underlying genetic causes of IHC in a timely manner. In 
addition to the genes associated with the three types of dis- 
eases discussed above, patient 064 had a variant in MTM1, 
which is the gene responsible for X-linked centronuclear 
myopathy. Joseph et al. [21] proposed that the symptoms 
of greater length at birth, large head circumference (with or 
without hydrocephalus), elongated face and slender digits, 
may suggest an early clinical diagnosis of this disease, which 
can usually be confirmed by muscle biopsy. With the devel- 
opment of genetic testing, these earlier invasive methods 
may be substituted. 
In addition, the genetic etiology rate of the patients with 
unclear clinical etiology was significantly higher than the 
genetic etiology rate of the patients with clear clinical eti- 
ologies. Consistent with previous literature reports, most 
hydrocephalus cases are present at birth or shortly after birth 
[2]. In this study, 66 (64%, 66/103) patients were diagnosed 
before 1 month of age. Most of the patients with a genetic 
etiology were distributed in the “1–6 months” group, but 
there were no significant differences of the genetic etiol- 
ogy rates among the different diagnosed age groups condi- 
tional on the clinical etiology being neither clear nor unclear. 
When investigating the genetic etiology distribution among 
the patients with different outcomes, comparative analyses 
were not practicable owing to a large number of patients lost 
to follow-up. When comparing the genetic etiology rates in 
patients born at term and before term, the rate was signifi- 
cantly lower in the preterm group than in the term group 

among the patients with clear clinical etiologies; however, 
the genetic etiology rates were not significantly different 
among the patients with unclear clinical etiology. IH was 
the most common clinical etiology of hydrocephalus in this 
cohort, and a total of 48 patients presented with IH, includ- 
ing 35 were preterm patients. Preterm hydrocephalus might 
be more commonly caused by IH owing to the intrinsic fra- 
gility of the germinal matrix vasculature and the fluctuation 
of cerebral blood flow [22–24], which may help to explain 
the low genetic etiology rate among the preterm patients 
with clear clinical etiologies. Thus, we inferred that a genetic 
etiology was more common to be found among IHC patients 
who had unclear clinical etiology. Although most of the 
patients with a genetic etiology were patients with unclear 
clinical etiology, it is worth mentioning that five patients 
with a clear clinical cause in this study also had a genetic 
etiology, and their genetic etiology rate was significantly 
higher in the term group than the preterm group. Those find- 
ings suggested that even among IHC patients (especially 
among term IHC patients) with a clear clinical etiology, the 
possibility of a genetic underpinning cannot be ruled out. 
To further elucidate the genetic causes of IHC, we con- 
ducted an EWAS of IHC within this cohort. Based on pre- 
vious reports and on our results, we speculated that ZEB1, 
SBF2, and GNAI2 might be associated with the formation 
of IHC. The literature suggests that ZEB1 mediates the acti- 
vation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) [25] and that ZEB1 
inhibition promotes the apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells via 
a NF-κB-related signaling pathway [26]. This evidence indi- 
cates that ZEB1 may mediate the activation of NF-κB, which 
is known to mediate neuroinflammation and impair ependy- 
mal ciliogenesis during early life after birth, thus leading to 
earlier hydrocephalus formation [27]. Moreover, ZEB1 has 
been reported to be a downstream signaling molecule in the 
sonic hedgehog pathway [28], a signaling pathway involved 
in hydrocephalus formation [29]. Similar to ZEB1, SBF2, 
and GNAI2 might be associated with molecular signaling 
pathways involved in hydrocephalus formation, including 
the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad and phos- 
phatidylinositol 3-hydroxy kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B 
(AKT) pathways, respectively [30, 31]. A previous study 
has reported that silencing SBF2 significantly promotes pan- 
creatic cancer cell apoptosis via the TGF-β/Smad signaling 
pathway, which is also involved in hydrocephalus formation 
[30, 32]. GNAI2 (G protein, alpha-inhibiting 2B) might be 
related to the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway because G-alpha 
inhibitory proteins are clearly involved in extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation [33], and a slight 
increase in ERK activity leads to a distinct enhancement of 
PI3K/AKT phosphorylation [34]. Thus, we speculate muta- 
tions within those three genes may have an impact on the 

 

signaling pathways related to hydrocephalus development 
and may be involved in the formation of IHC. Further studies 
are needed to confirm our findings. 
Our study had several limitations. Owing to the retro- 
spective nature of our data collection, not all data could 
be obtained, which might lead to underestimates of cer- 
tain results. In addition, this was a single-center study that 
included a period of 4 years, which represents a small sam- 
ple. Owing to the small number of patients in the study, we 
could not make a more complete comparison of the genetic 
and clinical etiologies of IHC patients. 
In conclusion, the large proportion of early-onset and 
agnogenic IHC cases indicates that genetic components 
might play an important role in the etiologies. The utility 
of genetic testing can help to reveal the genetic etiologies in 
IHC patients, especially in those who had unclear clinical 
etiology. Genes associated with metabolic disorders, brain 
abnormalities and genetic syndromes should be considered 
in a specific panel for detecting the genetic etiology of IHC 
patients when whole-exome sequencing or whole-genome 
sequencing are not available. We also identified genes that 
might have an impact on the signaling pathways involved 
in IHC formation, and these genes should be evaluated as 
potential IHC susceptibility genes.
