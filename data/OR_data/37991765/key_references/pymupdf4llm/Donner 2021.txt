### Introduction


A B S T R A C T

Purpose: We compared the diagnostic yield of fetal clinical exome sequencing (fCES) in prospective and retrospective cohorts of pregnancies presenting with anomalies detected using
ultrasound. We evaluated factors that led to a higher diagnostic efficiency, such as phenotypic
category, clinical characterization, and variant analysis strategy.
Methods: fCES was performed for 303 fetuses (183 ongoing and 120 ended pregnancies, in
which chromosomal abnormalities had been excluded) using a trio/duo-based approach and a
multistep variant analysis strategy.
Results: fCES identified the underlying genetic cause in 13% (24/183) of prospective and 29%
(35/120) of retrospective cases. In both cohorts, recessive heterozygous compound genotypes
were not rare, and trio and simplex variant analysis strategies were complementary to achieve
the highest possible diagnostic rate. Limited prenatal phenotypic information led to interpretation challenges. In 2 prospective cases, in-depth analysis allowed expansion of the spectrum of
prenatal presentations for genetic syndromes associated with the SLC17A5 and CHAMP1 genes.
Conclusion: fCES is diagnostically efficient in fetuses presenting with cerebral, skeletal, urinary,
or multiple anomalies. The comparison between the 2 cohorts highlights the importance of
providing detailed phenotypic information for better interpretation and prenatal reporting of
genetic variants.

Ultrasound detection of fetal abnormalities, which occurs in
approximately 2% to 4% of pregnancies,[1][,][2] is an essential
part of routine obstetrical care. When fetal structural
anomalies are suspected, invasive procedures (ie, amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling [CVS]) are offered for
prenatal genetic diagnosis. Historically, karyotype testing
was the first-line method to investigate chromosomal
anomalies, providing a diagnosis in approximately 30% of
fetuses with abnormal ultrasound findings.[3] With the


introduction of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA),
the diagnostic rate of chromosomal anomalies increased by
4% to 7%.[3-5] However, the search for a genetic diagnosis in
the remaining cases was costly and time-consuming before
the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS). The
encouraging results of exome sequencing (ES) in pediatric
patients[6-10] raised interest for its application in a prenatal
setting. Since 2014, several studies comprising small and
selected cohorts of aborted fetuses reported high diagnostic
yields (in the range of 50%-80%).[11-15] Recently, 2 large and

unselected prospective cohorts were reported with a lower
diagnostic rate (8%-10%).[16][,][17] As the use of ES increases in
prenatal care, medical professionals (eg, referring physicians, laboratory geneticists, genetic counselors) are faced
with complex technical and ethical challenges that must be
addressed collectively.[18]

Herein we report fetal clinical exome sequencing (fCES)
in a series of 303 pregnancies displaying abnormal ultrasound findings (with no selection of the type of fetal
anomalies) and normal quantitative fluorescent polymerase
–
chain reaction and CMA results, including 183 pregnancies
for which the diagnosis was obtained during the pregnancy
and hence contributed to the clinical decision process.
Importantly, the retrospective and prospective analyses were
carried out by the same center and in the same time frame,
allowing direct comparison of the diagnostic yields between
the 2 cohorts. In particular, we discuss the effect of the
availability of detailed phenotypic information for the
establishment of genetic diagnoses through fetal NGS-based
analyses. In addition, our series expanded the range of fetal
phenotypes investigated by genome-wide methods because
it included fetuses presenting with anomalies detected using
ultrasound anomalies that have rarely been explored by
NGS (ie, intrauterine growth restriction, amniotic fluid abnormalities) and uncovered novel associations between
known genotypes and fetal phenotypes. Finally, our study
aimed to share data analysis workflow strategies and interpretation challenges.

### Materials and Methods

#### Study design and participants

Patients were recruited from 14 centers (Supplemental
Table 1) between October 2016 and June 2020, and their
enrollment was conducted in parallel for both cohorts.
However, because of a long turnaround time (TAT) at the
beginning of the study, the cases recruited initially mostly
consisted of interrupted pregnancies. The study design is
summarized in Figure 1A. For the retrospective study cohort,
couples who had experienced a pregnancy characterized by
fetal anomalies for which the fetal sample was available were
recruited. For the prospective study cohort, on detection of
fetal structural anomalies during a routine ultrasound examination, parents who opted for invasive testing were offered
participation. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same
for both cohorts. Inclusion criteria were increased nuchal
translucency (NT) (>99th percentile and/or 3.5 mm at 11≥
14 weeks ultrasound scan), amniotic fluid anomalies, or any
major structural fetal malformation(s). Exclusion criteria
were fetuses presenting isolated soft markers (Supplemental
Table 2), known monogenic disease within the family,
identification of an etiology (chromosomal abnormality,
infection) explaining the fetal phenotype, and simplex cases


for which no parental DNA was available (ie, only trio/duo
analysis was performed). Families were informed about the
technical aspects and the limitations of the study by a clinical
geneticist or a trained gynecologist, and written informed
consent was obtained. The parents could opt in or out of the
return of incidental findings. This study was approved by the
ethical committee of the Hopital Erasme, Brussels, Belgium,ˆ
under the reference P2016/236.

#### Clinical data collection

In the retrospective study, information about fetal phenotypes was collected from imaging data and postmortem
examinations when available and used for genotype phe–
notype correlation during fCES analysis. In the prospective
study, fCES interpretation was based on imaging data
available at the time of the analysis. Retrospectively, clinical
data were reviewed in all cases, and phenotypes were an[notated using Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) (https://](https://hpo.jax.org/app/)
[hpo.jax.org/app/) terms,[19]](https://hpo.jax.org/app/) allowing classification in several
phenotypic categories (Supplemental Table 3).

#### fCES

Library preparation and sequencing
In the prospective study, fetal DNA was obtained from
CVS, amniotic fluid, or fetal blood that remained unused
after routine investigations. When the amount of DNA from
these samples was insufficient, DNA was extracted from
cultured samples. In the retrospective study, cultured fibroblasts or fetal biopsies were used for DNA extraction if no
other type of sample was available. Parental blood samples
were also collected for DNA extraction. In all prenatal
samples, maternal contamination and presence of the most
common aneuploidies were excluded by quantitative
fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (Elucigene QST*R
–
Plus v2, Elucigene Diagnostics). CMA on a CytoSure
Constitutional v3 8 60k array (Oxford Gene Technology)
×
was performed to exclude copy number variations (CNVs).
Library preparation was performed using KAPA HyperPrep/
HyperPlus Library Preparation Kit (Roche NimbleGen Inc).
An in-house SeqCap EZ Choice XL Probes (Roche NimbleGen Inc) targeting the coding exons of genes associated
with Mendelian disorders was used (4 designs)
(Supplemental Table 4). Libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 1500/NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina Inc). Bioinformatics pipeline was run at Brussels Interuniversity
[Genomics High Throughput core (BRIGHTcore) (http://](http://www.brightcore.be/)
[www.brightcore.be/). The mean coverage of fetal samples](http://www.brightcore.be/)
was between 250 and 300, and the parental samples were
× ×
sequenced at 150 . Reads were aligned to the reference
×
genome (GRCh37/hg19) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner
(version 0.7.10), and variant calling was performed using
Genome Analysis Toolkit (version 3.3).

Variant filtering
Variant filtering and interpretation were carried out through
[Highlander (https://sites.uclouvain.be/highlander/) accord-](https://sites.uclouvain.be/highlander/)
ing to allele frequency and effect on protein and inheritance
pattern (de novo, homozygous and compound heterozygous,
X-linked [XL] inheritance in the case of male fetuses). fCES
data were analyzed by a laboratory scientist in collaboration
with prenatally involved clinical geneticists using the
collected clinical information about fetal phenotypes (as
described in the clinical data collection section). In particular, variant filtering included several steps (Figure 1B).
First, a comprehensive in silico panel of genes (up to 1273
genes) involved in congenital anomalies (developed from
Pangalos et al[13] and Fetal anomalies panel from Genomics
[England PanelApp [https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.](https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/)
[uk/]) (Supplemental Table 5) was analyzed using a trio/](https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/)
duo-based approach, exploring the different inheritance
patterns. Second, trio/duo analysis of the entire clinical
exome (up to 4867 genes) (Supplemental Table 4) was
accomplished for all inheritance modes. If the results of the
previous analyses were negative and the fetal anomalies
were specific for 1 system or were highly suggestive of
defined genetic disorders, further in silico gene panels were
investigated exclusively in the proband (simplex analysis)
[using Genomics England PanelApp, GeneReviews (https://](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1116/)
[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1116/),](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1116/) HPO, or the
most recent literature. In selected cases (ie, only 1 likely
pathogenic/pathogenic variant detected in genes responsible
for recessive disorders), single exon CNVs were detected
using Copy Number Variation Detection In NGS gene
panels[20] and exonic CNV data were visualized using inhouse software. This exonic CNV pipeline was run
retrospectively.

Variant interpretation
Variant interpretation and classification followed international guidelines (pathogenic: class V; likely pathogenic:
class IV; variant of unknown significance (VUS): class III;
likely benign: class II; benign: class I).[21] For class V, we
used stringent criteria because the analysis had to be performed with phenotypic information that was limited to the
prenatal stages (ie, fetal ultrasound and, if available, nuclear
magnetic resonance imaging) and, for the majority of prospective cases, absent/limited postnatal phenotypic characterization; therefore, only the variants already reported in the
literature as pathogenic were classified as class V. Nonetheless, highly suspicious novel variants (eg, loss-offunction variant in a dosage-sensitive gene) within genes
related to the fetal phenotype were classified as likely
pathogenic (class IV) and reported. In addition, if further
information was needed for correct interpretation of the data
or if a potential discrepancy between the genetic findings
and the fetal phenotype was noted, candidate variants were
discussed in a multidisciplinary team.
Our ethical review board approved informed consent
–
form did not mention the possibility of opting in/out of
reporting secondary variant information. Therefore, the


American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations for reporting of secondary findings[22] were
not followed. In particular, fetal incidental findings were
reported only if highly penetrant pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were detected in genes known to cause
moderate or severe childhood-onset disorders. Pathogenic or
likely pathogenic variants in genes known to cause medically actionable dominant conditions (inherited cancer
syndromes, cardiovascular, and others) were reported
exclusively in the parental reports if they had consented to
the return of these results.

Variant validation
Variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing if they arose
as a de novo event in the index case or if the variant callspecific metrics (eg, read depth, allele balance, strand bias)
and/or their genomic context (eg, presence of repeats,
pseudogenic regions) were considered suboptimal.

#### Statistical analysis

The number of diagnostic variants in the 2 cohorts was
compared using a χ[2] test performed using GraphPad Prism
v.7.0 (GraphPad Software).

### Results

A total of 300 couples were recruited, and 303 fetal samples
(120 terminated and 183 ongoing pregnancies) were processed for fCES (Supplemental Tables 6 and 7). Fetal DNA
was obtained from amniocentesis (68.9%, 209/303), CVS
(14.1%, 43/303), fetal blood (6.6%, 20/303), or tissue
samples (10.2%, 31/303). Male to female ratios were 0.94
(89/94) and 1.2 (66/54) in the prospective and retrospective
cohorts, respectively. fCES was mostly performed in trio
(176 prospective and 116 retrospective cases), followed by
duo (7 prospective cases) or quartet (4 retrospective cases
belonging to 2 couples). In the prospective group pregnancy, outcomes were available for 105 of 183 fetuses
(57%). Of these, the parents opted for termination in 45
pregnancies (25%), 6 ended in miscarriages (3%), 2 ended
in neonatal deaths (1%), and 52 were livebirths (28%). In
contrast, in the retrospective cohort, the pregnancy outcome
was known in most cases (109/120, 91%). Ninety of them
were terminated (82.5%), 16 ended in miscarriages (15%),
and 3 ended in neonatal death (2.5%).
Among the prospective cases, warning signs were variable. Some phenotypic categories represented a small sample
size (<10 cases), such as anomalies of the endocrine system
(0.5%, 1/183), digestive tract (1.6%, 3/183), genital
system (1.6%, 3/183), spine (1.6%, 3/183), face (2.2%,
4/183), fluid regulation (2.2%, 4/183), musculature (2.7%,
5/183), and amniotic fluid volume (3.3%, 6/183) (Figure 2B).

(7.7%, 14/183), skeleton (8.2%, 15/183), nervous system
(12%, 22/183), multiple organs (33.9%, 62/183), and NT
(10.9%, 20/183) represented larger cohorts (Figure 2B). In
contrast, most of the retrospective cases displayed multiple
(65.8%, 79/120) and cerebral abnormalities (11.7%, 14/120),
followed by fetuses with spinal (6.7%, 8/120), urinary (5.8%,
7/120), fluid regulation (3.3%, 4/120), facial (3.3%, 4/120),
skeletal (1.7%, 2/120), cardiovascular (0.8%, 1/120), and
digestive (0.8%, 1/120) defects (Figure 3B).


In the prospective cohort, our multistep variant analysis
process provided a genetic diagnosis in 24 of 183 cases
(13%) (Figure 2A, Table 1). None of the 7 cases for which a
duo-based analysis was performed could be solved. Most
diagnostic variants (18/24, 75%) were found through analysis of the congenital anomalies gene panel (Figures 1B and
2A). Four additional cases (4/24, 16.7%) were solved
through analysis of the whole clinical exome (Figures 1B
and 2A). A specific in silico gene panel in simplex analysis

(ie, only filtering on the proband variants) solved 2 more
cases (2/24, 8.3%) (Figure 2A). Among the positive cases,
only 1 presented a relevant family history (ie, affected fetus
from previous pregnancy). When only consanguineous
couples (n 12) were taken into account, the diagnostic
=
yield increased to 42% (5/12). In the whole prospective
cohort, autosomal dominant (AD) disorders accounted for
46% (n 11) of cases and all were caused by a de novo

variant (genes: PIK3CA, ZIC2, TSC2, NRAS, COL1A1,
CHAMP1, ARID1B, TP63, RASA1) (Table 1). Autosomal
recessive (AR) disorders were diagnosed in 11 cases (46%),
including 6 (54.5%) with compound heterozygous variants
and 5 (45.5%) with homozygous variants (genes: MKS1,
PKHD1, PKD1, SLC7A9, TPO, RBM8A, SLC17A5, COQ9,
BBS7) (Table 1). In this last subgroup, consanguinity was
noted in 4 of 5 cases, and a founder pathogenic variant was

present in the remaining case. One XL disorder was found
(1/24, 4.2%) (gene: IDS) (Table 1), and a digenic diagnosis
was proposed in 1 case (1/24, 4.2%). Interestingly, 2 cases
involved detection of a single nucleotide change along with
a CNV (genes: RBM8A and SLC17A5) (Table 1). The
highest diagnostic yields in the prospective cohort (among
subgroups with 10 cases) were obtained for skeletal (20%,
≥
n 3/15), multiple (19%, n 12/62), urinary (18%, n
= = =
2/11), and cerebral anomalies (14%, n 3/22) (Figure 2B).
=
Three cases from our prospective series warranted further
description (see Supplemental Case Reports for details). The
discovery of a novel fetal phenotype caused by a novel
variant within a known gene is illustrated by case P131 for
which a de novo truncating variant of the CHAMP1 gene
(Supplemental Figure 2, Supplemental Case Reports),
associated with AD mental retardation (OMIM 616579),
was detected in a fetus presenting with increased NT and
congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Case P136, presenting
with hydrops fetalis, hyperechogenic kidneys, and hepatomegaly, was solved by the detection of 1 pathogenic variant
in the SLC17A5 gene (Salla disease, OMIM 604369) by a
––
simplex analysis of an in silico panel hydrops fetalis along
––
with a SLC17A5 microduplication detected after the CNV
analysis through Copy Number Variation Detection In NGS
gene panels (Supplemental Figure 1, Supplemental Case
Reports), showing the need for multiple analysis strategies. In numerous cases, medical teams are faced with
variant interpretation challenges, as in case P178 presenting
with spina bifida, lemon sign, and mild fetal ventriculomegaly for which compound heterozygous VUS were
detected in the SCRIB gene (Supplemental Figure 3,
Supplemental Case Reports), a candidate gene for neural
tube defects.
Most fetuses in the prospective cohort were classified
using 1 to 3 HPO terms (Figure 2C), with a median number
of 2 terms. Although the correlation between frequency of a
positive diagnosis and the number of HPO terms was not
statistically significant, the trend of the plot may suggest that
fCES diagnostic yield could be partially determined by an
accurate phenotypic description (Figure 2D).
In the retrospective cohort, a diagnosis was reached in 35
of 120 cases (29%) through multistep analysis (Figure 3A,
Table 2). The diagnostic rate was thus significantly higher in
the retrospective than in the prospective cohort (N 303;
=
X(2)[2] [=][ 11.9;][ P][ <][ .001). Most variants (30/35, 86%) were]
found using the gene panel for congenital anomalies
(Figures 1B and 3A), and the remaining cases required
analysis of all the fCES genes (5/35, 14%) (Figure 3A).
Among the solved cases, 5 were characterized by a positive
family history (5/35, 14%). When only consanguineous
couples were considered (n 15), the diagnostic rate
=
increased to 40% (6/15). AD disorders were diagnosed in
49% (17/35) with mostly de novo variants (15/35, 43%)
(genes: ACTA1, MYH3, HRAS, PTPN11, DVL1, FLNB,
RIT1, BRAF, JAG1, KMT2D, COL1A1, GREB1L) (Table 2).
Parental mosaicism was identified in 2 of the cases affected
by AD syndromes (genes: COL1A1, GREB1L) (Table 2).


Similar to AD disorders, AR diseases were diagnosed in 17
cases (17/35, 49%) with compound heterozygous (9/35,
26%) and homozygous variants (8/35, 23%) (genes: NEB,
ASCC1, ASPM, GBE1, B3GALNT2, ISPD, CEP290,
PIEZO1, TUBGCP6, TNNT3, DDX11, ALG3, ETFA)
(Table 2). In 5 of 8 fetuses (63%) presenting with homozygous variants, the parents were consanguineous, whereas
in most other cases the variants were hotspot variants.
Moreover, an XL disorder was diagnosed (1/35, 3%) (gene:
IDS) (Table 2). The greatest proportion of diagnostic genetic
variants (subgroups with 10 cases) were found in fetuses
≥
presenting with multiple (34%, n 27/79) and cerebral
=
(28.5%, n 4/14) anomalies (Figure 3B).
=
The average number of HPO terms used was 5, and most
of the cases were described using 3 or 4 terms (Figure 3C).
As seen in the prospective cohort, there is a trend suggesting
that a detailed fetal phenotype characterization enhances the
likelihood of a diagnosis (Figure 3D).
VUS that may have contributed to the fetal phenotype
were reported in 7% of prospective (12/183) and retrospective (8/120) cases (Figures 2A and 3A, Supplemental
Table 8). The analysis of the gene panel for congenital
anomalies (Figure 1B) allowed VUS identification in 4 of 12
prospective and 3 of 8 retrospective cases. In 5 of 12 prospective and 5 of 8 retrospective cases, VUS were detected
after analysis of all fCES genes. In the prospective cohort,
additional simplex gene panel analyses identified the 3
remaining VUS.
Fetal incidental findings were reported in 2 prospective
cases (Supplemental Table 9), and 2 of the 3 variants reported were found after the analysis of all the fCES gene
content. Parental incidental findings were reported in 5 cases
(1 retrospective and 4 prospective cases), and they were
mostly detected through whole clinical exome analysis
(Supplemental Table 10).
The average TAT, defined as the number of days between the request for fCES and the final report validation by
a clinical geneticist, was calculated for both cohorts. The
average TAT was 4 and 2.5 months for the retrospective and
prospective cohorts, respectively. For the latter, TAT
improved to 29 working days (range 17-43 working days)
during the course of our study.

### Discussion

The use of fCES in fetuses presenting with anomalies
detected using ultrasound allowed the identification of the
underlying genetic cause in 13% prospective and 29%
retrospective cases by using a multistep variant analysis.
One factor that could explain the difference might be the
case recruitment procedure because interrupted pregnancies
more often displayed a severe multisystem phenotype and
were selected by clinical geneticists. In addition, detailed
phenotypic information was available, offering valuable
support for variant interpretation. Consequently, the diagnostic rate of the retrospective cohort was similar to that of

the postnatal series.[10][,][15] Conversely, the prospective cohort
included unselected cases, notably some with fetal anomalies weakly associated with monogenic findings (ie,
increased NT or neural tube defects). Furthermore, variant
interpretation was hampered by the limited knowledge of in
utero phenotypes. Results from the unselected cohort are
comparable with the ones described in other ES prospective
studies in which diagnostic variants were detected in 8.5%
to 10.3% of cases.[16][,][17] Our slightly higher diagnostic yield
may be explained by a greater proportion of consanguineous
couples (12/171, 7%).
The highest diagnostic rates were achieved for fetuses
presenting with multisystem and cerebral anomalies in the
retrospective cohort. In the multisystem subgroup, a
conclusive molecular diagnosis was reached for most cases
with a fetal akinesia sequence (9/11, 82%) or a MeckelGruber related phenotype (5/6, 83%), indicating that fCES
–
is highly recommended for these ultrasound findings. In the
prospective cohort, diagnostic rates were highest in fetuses
with multiple systems, skeletal, urinary, and cerebral
anomalies. These results are in agreement with previous
studies,[16][,][17] although higher rates for fetuses with cardiac[16]

and lymphatic[17] anomalies were also described. Because the
proportion of cases belonging to these phenotypic categories
was small in our cohort, further studies are required to draw
final conclusions. Similarly, the absence of diagnostic variants in rarely explored phenotypic categories (ie, isolated
intrauterine growth restriction and anomalies of the amniotic
fluid) needs to be further investigated in larger series. In line
with other studies, no NGS diagnostic variants were found
in fetuses with either neural tube defects or isolated
increased NT.[16][,][23] More data, more exploratory variant selection, and more complex heritability investigations (eg,
oligogenic, noncoding, polygenic) will be necessary to
assess the diagnostic yield of NGS in these anomalies.
Interestingly, our study shows that the proportion of AD
and AR diagnoses was the same, which is in contrast with
reports related to postnatal series in which de novo variants
accounted for most of the cases.[24] Remarkably, our study
shows the importance of investigating compound heterozygous variants (especially in nonconsanguineous cases) because
they represent 54.5% and 26% of positive AR diagnoses in
our 2 cohorts. This result may be explained by the fact that AR
diseases are more often responsible for the interruption of
pregnancy or perinatal lethality. Other fetal series observed
similar proportions,[12][,][16][,][17][,][25] suggesting that AR disorders play
an important role in severe fetal phenotypes.
On the basis of the experience accumulated in this and
other studies,[11][,][26][,][27] it seems beneficial to perform a trio/duobased analysis involving all the genes of the clinical exome.
Such an analysis strategy carries a diagnostic gain of 16.7%
(prospective cases) and 14% (retrospective cohort) when
compared with a trio/duo analysis focused on a comprehensive congenital anomalies gene panel designed using literature (Figures 2A and 3A). In complement to this strategy, we
found that, when appropriate, a simplex analysis of in silico
panels comprising genes specific for the fetal phenotype with


adapted variant selection criteria also increased the diagnostic
yield (8.3% in the prospective cohort) (Figure 2A).
In addition to expanding our understanding of fetal presentations for known genetic conditions (as in case P6,
described in[28]) and identifying new types of pathogenic
variants in association with them (as in case P32, reported
in[29]), phenotypes resembling conditions not previously reported prenatally may be identified, leading to challenges in
data interpretation and assessment of the variants patho’
genicity (represented here by case P131). Additional challenges arise with recessive pathologies for which only 1
pathogenic variant is detected, such as in prospective case
P136. Finally, further analysis of specific gene panels using
simplex analysis allowed the detection of inherited pathogenic variants responsible for AD disorders with incomplete
penetrance or the discovery of 1 diagnostic variant in genes
responsible for AR disorders consistent with the fetal
phenotype, which would otherwise have been missed if only
trio-based analysis was performed (P136).
In most of the reported VUS, the variants were heterozygous in an asymptomatic parent, and further clinical examinations and segregation analysis were recommended to assess
pathogenicity. Incomplete penetrance and variable expression
among family members (eg, variants within the COL4A2
gene and risk of porencephaly) complicate evaluation, and
these variants often remain of unknown significance until
similar cases with the same variant are identified in independent families. VUS may also contribute to some phenotypic features that a diagnostic variant could not explain (as
found in case P158) (Table 1). Although smaller, focused
gene panels limit the incidental identification of VUS[16] and
true diagnoses may also be missed,[25] making the selection of
the most appropriate analysis method challenging.
As fCES/ES become more widely implemented, it is
crucial to share phenotypic and molecular data in international databases to improve variant interpretation and
recognition of novel fetal genotype phenotype correlations.
–
The absence of a statistically significant correlation between
the number of HPO terms and the percentage of conclusive
diagnoses may be explained by multiple factors, such as the
reduced number of cases presenting with a high number of
HPO terms, the presence of cases with multiple anomalies
with a low-level association with monogenic diseases, and/
or the fact that some genetic anomalies or variants in genes
not studied in our design are not detected. Further analyses
on larger series will be needed to draw final conclusions on
the importance of the HPO terminology usage. Nonetheless,
we highly recommend that clinicians requesting fetal NGS
provide detailed clinical information and family history to
genetics laboratories.[18] Moreover, in the context of interrupted pregnancies, the complementary information identified by postmortem examination strongly contributes to a
higher diagnostic yield. Of note, we encountered difficulties
in describing some fetal phenotypes because HPO terms
were missing for a portion of prenatal anomalies detected
using ultrasound (eg, antenatal hyperechoic colon) or subtypes of anomalies. We thus believe that efforts should be


-----

made to expand the existing fetal HPO terminology. Similarly, we found that variant classification could be particularly challenging in a prenatal setting because classical
criteria[21] were not always applicable given the inevitably
limited phenotypic characterization in utero.
Our study has limitations regarding the diagnosis of some
phenotypic categories that will require further clinical
evaluations. Another limitation of our study is that exonic
CNVs were not routinely investigated and were only
analyzed when 1 diagnostic variant was already found in a
gene causing an AR phenotype. In contrast to other studies,
ES was not performed. Although our approach limits the
discovery of new disease-causing genes and the data reanalysis power, it is suitable for a prenatal clinical setting,
allowing very high-quality coverage data in well-known
genes causing Mendelian disorders with prenatal onset. In
addition, clinical exome sequencing (CES)/ES-based
methods are limited to the detection of coding variants and
misses some genetic defects (eg, deep intronic variants,
nucleotide repeat expansions). This limitation can be overcome by genome sequencing (GS). However, because of the
greater cost of GS over CES/ES-based methods, it is likely
that combined CMA and CES/ES-based analysis will
become more widely implemented before the advent of GS
in the prenatal clinical setting. The refined prenatal
phenotype genotype correlations expected to be obtained
–
from CES/ES-based methods will likely facilitate the subsequent implementation of fetal GS.
In conclusion, this study showed that the overall diagnostic yields of CES using a multistep variant analysis were
13% and 29% in prospective and retrospective cases,
respectively. In particular, trio/duo-based analysis involving
all the genes of the clinical exome and simplex analysis (ie,
in silico panels on fCES data comprising genes specific for
the fetal phenotype) were complementary to achieve the
highest diagnostic rate possible, and compound heterozygous genotypes were not rare. fCES-based diagnosis was
efficient in fetuses presenting with cerebral, skeletal, urinary, or multiple anomalies. The comparison between a
retrospective and a prospective cohort highlighted the
importance of providing detailed phenotypic information to
genetic laboratories performing fetal NGS for better interpretation and reporting of genetic variants. Finally, selected
cases illustrate some interpretation challenges faced during
the analysis of genome-wide data and widen the knowledge
of the prenatal presentation of genetic syndromes.
