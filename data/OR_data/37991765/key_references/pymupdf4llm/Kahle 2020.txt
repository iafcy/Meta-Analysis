## Exome sequencing implicates genetic disruption of prenatal neuro-gliogenesis in sporadic congenital hydrocephalus


_A full list of authors and affiliations appears at the end of the article._

### Abstract


Congenital hydrocephalus (CH), characterized by enlarged brain ventricles, is considered a disease
of excessive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulation and thereby treated with neurosurgical CSF
diversion with high morbidity and failure rates. The poor neurodevelopmental outcomes and
persistence of ventriculomegaly in some post-surgical patients highlight our limited knowledge of
disease mechanisms. Through whole-exome sequencing of 381 patients (232 trios) with sporadic,
neurosurgically treated CH, we found that damaging de novo mutations account for >17% of
cases, with five different genes exhibiting a significant de novo mutation burden. In all, rare,
damaging mutations with large effect contributed to ~22% of sporadic CH cases. Multiple CH
genes are key regulators of neural stem cell biology and converge in human transcriptional
networks and cell types pertinent for fetal neuro-gliogenesis. These data implicate genetic
disruption of early brain development, not impaired CSF dynamics, as the primary
pathomechanism of a significant number of patients with sporadic CH.


Hydrocephalus has been classically defined as cerebral ventricular enlargement
(‘ventriculomegaly’), resulting from progressive accumulation of CSF[1]. This mechanism is
most often observed in acquired (‘secondary’) hydrocephalus associated with brain
hemorrhage, tumor or infection. In these cases, an increase in CSF production relative to
CSF reabsorption leads to an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), which causes tissue
damage, neurological impairment and death if untreated. In this context, neurosurgical CSF

diversion (via ventricular shunting or brain endoscopy) can acutely decrease ICP and
ventricular size and dramatically restore neurological function. Nonetheless, these
neurosurgeries have high morbidity and failure rates[2].

In contrast, many neonatal or infantile cases of CH are classified as developmental
(‘primary’) hydrocephalus[3], because they lack a known antecedent. CH can occur in the
setting of no obvious intraventricular obstruction to CSF flow (communicating
hydrocephalus) or exhibit partial or complete intraventricular obstruction, usually from
aqueductal stenosis. CH may be associated with motor deficits, intellectual disability and
epilepsy that can persist despite neurosurgical intervention[4]. These observations suggest that
CH is not simply a disorder of impaired ‘brain plumbing’ treatable by CSF diversion, but a
complex neurodevelopmental disorder with associated functional deficits referable to the
brain parenchyma.


While some communicating forms of CH are associated with increased ICPs, other cases
can have documented ICPs in the borderline-high, normal or even low range and can be
associated with severe thinning of the cortical mantle[1,5]. Neurosurgical CSF diversion when
undertaken in this context can fail to reduce ventriculomegaly or improve
neurodevelopmental outcomes[6]. The determination of which patients with CH may benefit
from neurosurgical intervention can be a complex clinical challenge, as their clinical and
neuroradiographic presentations may be similar[1]. A molecular classification of CH could
improve prognostication and clinical decision-making for caregivers.

Epidemiological studies and reports of familial CH suggest genetic etiologies for up to 40%
of cases[7], but few causal mutations have been identified. Traditional linkage and targeted
sequencing approaches have identified mutations in L1CAM (OMIM no. 307000), MPDZ
(OMIM no. 615219), CCDC88C (OMIM no. 236600) and AP1S2 (OMIM no. 300629)[8].
Other genes have been linked with CH in Mendelian syndromes (for example, ciliopathies)
characterized by severe systemic (such as respiratory, cardiac and renal) abnormalities[8], but
>95% of CH cases are sporadic and of unknown cause[8].


### Results


Next-generation sequencing has revolutionized the identification of genetic causes of human
disease. We recently used whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify four new genes not
previously implicated in human CH[9]. We now present the largest WES study to date of
sporadic, neurosurgically treated CH, integrated with transcriptomics of human brain
development. Our data implicate genetically encoded neural stem cell (NSC) dysregulation
and an associated impairment of fetal neuro-gliogenesis as primary pathophysiological
events in a significant number of CH cases.

We recruited 381 genetically undiagnosed probands (including 232 parent–offspring trios)
with sporadic, neurosurgically treated, primary (developmental) CH (excluding
myelomeningocele) (Supplementary Table 1), including 169 previously reported CH
probands with 125 trios[9]. Studies were Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved by Yale’s
Human Research Protection Program (Methods). DNA was isolated and WES was

performed[9]. A total of 1,798 control trios (comprising unaffected siblings and parents of
patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC)
cohort) were analyzed in parallel (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Overall, 8.7% of
probands were from consanguineous union, versus 1.3% ASD sibling controls
(Supplementary Dataset 1 and Supplementary Table 2; Methods for sequence variant calling,
calibration, annotation and validation). Mutations in known familial CH genes[8] accounted
for ~2.1% of cases, including mutations in L1CAM (OMIM no. 307000), MPDZ (OMIM
no. 615219), FLNA (OMIM no. 300049) and CRB2 (OMIM no. 219730) described in
Supplementary Table 4. Removal of the eight patients from further analyses yielded 373 CH
probands, including 225 trios.


**Protein-damaging de novo mutations account for a large fraction of sporadic CH.**

The average de novo mutation (DNM) rate of 1.307 per subject (Supplementary Dataset 2)
resembled previous results with the identical sequencing platform[10] and followed a Poisson
distribution (Supplementary Fig. 1). Protein-damaging DNMs were significantly enriched
among all genes (enrichment of 1.72, P = 6.6 × 10[−7]; Supplementary Table 5), with greater
enrichment among genes intolerant of loss-of-function (LoF) mutations (pLI ≥ 0.9 in
gnomAD v.2.1.1) and among genes in the top quartile of mouse brain bulk RNA-sequencing
(RNA-seq) expression (Methods). Enrichment was greatest among genes meeting both
criteria (3.71-fold, P = 5.0 × 10[−9]; Supplementary Table 5). We estimated that damaging
DNMs can account for 17.7% of cases in this cohort (Supplementary Table 5).


Twelve genes had ≥2 protein-altering DNMs (Table 1a) versus 2.7 genes expected by chance
(4.5-fold enrichment; P = 8.0 × 10[−6] by 1 million permutations; Table 1b). Greater
enrichment of recurrent genes was observed in LoF-intolerant genes with multiple DNMs
(8.9-fold enrichment; P = 1.0 × 10[−5]; Table 1c), supporting these as causal CH disease
genes. Five genes (TRIM71, SMARCC1, PTEN, PIK3CA and FOXJ1) had significantly
more protein-altering DNMs than expected by chance (P value threshold of 8.6 × 10[−7] after
correction for testing 19,347 RefSeq genes in triplicate using a one-tailed Poisson test; Table
1a). Three other genes that are highly intolerant of LoF mutations exhibited ≥2 proteinaltering DNMs: MTOR, PTCH1 and FMN2.


**_TRIM71 and SMARCC1 are bona fide CH risk genes that likely define new syndromes._**

By comparing observed and expected DNMs among CH cases, we previously[9] identified
enrichment in CH cases of protein-altering DNMs in TRIM71, encoding the RNA-binding
protein Tripartite Motif Containing 71, homolog of let-7 (lethal 7) microRNA target lin-41,
and in SMARCC1, encoding BAF155 subunit of BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF;
Saccharomyces cerevisiae SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex. Our expanded cohort
included three new damaging TRIM71 DNMs and one in SMARCC1 (c.1571+1G>A) (Fig.
1, Supplementary Tables 6–7, Extended Data Figs. 1–2 and Supplementary Figs. 2–3). Both
genes surpassed genome-wide significance thresholds in DNM enrichment and case–control
tests (Table 1a, Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 8).


TRIM71 maintains stem cell pluripotency by the post-transcriptional silencing of target
mRNAs via interactions with its RNA-binding NHL domain (reviewed previously[11]). Six

DNMs in TRIM71 included three p.Arg608His mutations and three p.Arg796His mutations,
mapping respectively to homologous positions in the conserved first and fifth blades of
TRIM71’s RNA-binding NHL domain (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 6a). The
probability of three occurrences of a single DNM in this cohort is low (P = 7.7 × 10[−9]) and
vanishingly small for two sites in the same gene (Supplementary Information). A previously
unidentified, unphased damaging TRIM71 mutation (p.Asn701Lys) in NHL domain’s third
blade was also predicted to destabilize protein–RNA interactions (Fig. 1c). Mutations
p.Arg608His and p.Arg796His impair TRIM71’s degradation of specific target RNAs[12].
Trim71 deletion in mice results in exencephaly and embryonic lethality by decreasing NSC
proliferation (reviewed previously[11]).

SMARCC1 is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that regulates gene expression
required for NSC proliferation, differentiation and survival during telencephalon
development[13]. SMARCC1 harbored three DNMs (p.His526Pro, p.Lys891fs and
c.1571+1G>A), two transmitted LoF mutations (p.Gln575X and p.Val535fs), one unphased
rare LoF variant (p.Thr415fs) and one transmitted rare damaging missense (D-Mis) variant
(p.Arg652Cys), with five of seven likely LoF mutations (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table
7a). The damaging SMARCC1 DNM, p.His526Pro, is predicted to abolish interaction with
the backbone carbonyl oxygen of p.Leu505 at the end of an adjacent helix in the SWIRM
domain mediating BAF complex subunit interactions[14] (Fig. 1c). Another rare transmitted
D-Mis SMARCC1 p.Arg652Cys variant alters a conserved residue in the Myb-like DNAbinding catalytic domain. All other variants are absent in gnomAD and Bravo databases.
Approximately 80% of mice homozygous for Smarcc1 missense allele Baf155[msp/msp ]


exhibit exencephaly similar to Trim71 mutant mice as a result of defective NSC proliferation
and increased apoptosis[15]. These data suggest that SMARCC1 haploinsufficiency increases
CH risk.

CH probands with recurrent TRIM71 DNMs each had significant white matter volume loss
and corpus callosum abnormalities, with cranial nerve deficits (n = 4), nonobstructive
interhemispheric cysts (n = 3), hearing loss (n = 3) and skeletal abnormalities (n = 2)
(Supplementary Table 6b). In contrast, all six patients with SMARCC1 mutations with
available brain imaging data had aqueductal stenosis and corpus callosum abnormalities,
along with cardiac (n = 3) and skeletal abnormalities (n = 2) (Supplementary Table 7b).
Complete septal agenesis or septal abnormalities, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, developmental
delay and epilepsy were additional common features in both TRIM71 and SMARCC1
mutant probands. We conclude that TRIM71 and SMARCC1 are new bona fide CH risk
genes whose mutation likely defines new Mendelian syndromes with variable expressivity of
associated phenotypes.


**PI3K signaling genes PIK3CA, PTEN and MTOR are frequently mutated in sporadic CH.**

PI3K pathway genes regulate cell growth, proliferation and differentiation in multiple
tissues[16], including NSCs in developing ventricular zone[17] (Fig. 2a). Somatic PIK3CA or
MTOR gain-of-function (GoF) mutations and PTEN LoF mutations drive tumorigenesis by
increasing PIP3 levels[18]. Related germline or mosaic mutations have been identified in
multiple brain and body overgrowth syndromes that also predispose to cancer[19].

-----

PIK3CA harbored three DNMs (p.Asp350Asn, p.Glu365Lys and p.Gly914Arg) in unrelated
probands with shunted CH, macrocephaly, megalencephaly, polymicrogyria and craniofacial
abnormalities (Fig. 2, Supplementary Tables 9–11 and Extended Data Fig. 3). This DNM
burden surpassed thresholds for genome-wide significance (P = 4.9 × 10[−7]; Table 1a). All
three DNMs were previously linked to megalencephaly-capillary malformationpolymicrogyria syndrome (MCAP) (OMIM no. 602501; Supplementary Table 9);[20,21 ]

localize to sites of recurrent mutation in cancer;[22] and are predicted to alter catalytic subunit
structure (Supplementary Fig. 4). The two variants p.Glu365Lys and p.Gly914Arg
constitutively increase PI3K activity and mTOR phosphorylation[20,21], whereas the
biochemical activity of p.Asp350Asn remains unevaluated. The fraction of mutant allele
reads (43–53%) provided no evidence of somatic mosaicism (Supplementary Table 10).
Consistent with a GoF effect of these PIK3CA DNMs, NSC-specific conditional expression
of a Pik3ca activating allele during mouse embryogenesis induced 100% penetrant, severe
nonobstructive murine hydrocephalus with focally increased NSC proliferation and
disruption of cell adhesion at the neural-ependymal transition zone[23].

PIK3CA also harbored two rare, unphased D-Mis mutations, p.Arg770Gln and p.Asn345Ser,
both less frequent somatic targets in cancer (Supplementary Table 9 and Fig. 2). Similar to
CH probands with PIK3CA DNMs, the CH proband with p.Arg770Gln exhibited
macrocephaly, megalencephaly and polymicrogyria, supporting a similar functional effect,
whereas the patient with p.Asn345Ser shared no syndromic features.


Notably, these PI3K pathway mutant CH probands carried no clinical or genetic diagnosis at
time of study recruitment (Supplementary Table 11), despite previous neurosurgical
treatment. Nonetheless, four CH probands with PIK3CA mutations retrospectively meet
Martinez-Glez’s clinical criteria[24] for MCAP, rarely associated with treated
hydrocephalus[24].

PTEN contained three DNMs (p.Tyr16X, p.Arg130Gln and p.Arg335X) in unrelated CH
probands (P = 1.9 × 10[−8]; Supplementary Table 9 and Extended Data Fig. 4). Probands had
macrocephaly (without megalencephaly) and cerebellar tonsillar ectopia. Two probands had
polymicrogyria (Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 11). All three DNMs
are linked to PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome[25–27] and are sites of recurrent somatic
mutation in cancer (Supplementary Table 9). Consistent with a LoF mechanism for PTEN
CH DNMs, Pten conditional deletion in mouse NSCs causes increased PIP3 signaling and
severe obstructive hydrocephalus due to increased ventricular zone NSC proliferation and
cell size, with associated cerebral aqueduct obliteration[28].


PTEN p.Arg130Gln (unphased) was detected in an unrelated CH proband with
macrocephaly, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia and neurodevelopmental delay (Fig. 2). Another
CH proband with macrocephaly, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia and neurodevelopmental delay
carried the rare, inherited D-Mis PTEN VUS, p.Ser305Asn (Supplementary Tables 9 and
11). Both probands had aqueductal stenosis. p.Ser305Asn is predicted to disrupt PTEN C2
domain structure (Supplementary Fig. 5), but is not recurrently mutated in cancer.

These PTEN-mutated probands had no previous genetic or clinical diagnosis of PTEN
hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) (OMIM no. 158350), including Cowden, Bannayan–
Riley–Ruvalcaba and autism-macrocephaly syndrome subtypes). However, one patient with
PTEN p.Arg335X DNM retrospectively met diagnostic criteria[29].

MTOR harbored two DNMs (p.Glu1799Lys and p.Met304Thr) in unrelated CH probands
with macrocephaly, craniofacial abnormalities and skeletal defects (Fig. 2, Supplementary
Tables 9 and 11 and Extended Data Fig. 5). A site of recurrent cancer mutation[30],
p.Glu1799Lys has also been implicated in ASD[30], megalencephaly[30] and Smith–Kingsmore
(or MINDS) syndrome (OMIM no. 616638)[30]. However, the patient carrying this mutation
did not meet the criteria for Smith–Kingsmore syndrome. The p.Glu1799Lys DNM
increases mTORC1 kinase activity[30] and is predicted to alter mTOR helix positioning at the
FAT domain interface that binds negative regulators of mTOR kinase activity
(Supplementary Fig. 6)[31]. The new p.Met304Thr DNM (also a site of recurrent mutation)
alters a highly conserved amino acid residue predicted to alter structure of the mTOR HEAT
domain required for interaction with inhibitory regulators (Supplementary Fig. 6).
p.Met304Thr has not been implicated in Smith–Kingsmore syndrome. Consistent with a
GoF mechanism for MTOR CH DNMs, mTOR inhibitor rapamycin can rescue the severe
neonatal hydrocephalus associated with constitutive mTORC1 hyperactivation in NSCs due
to primary cilia ablation[23].


MTOR contained other inherited or unphased rare, D-Mis variants of uncertain significance
(p.Arg769Cys, p.Arg1161Gly, p.Arg1170Cys and p.His1782Arg) (Supplementary Table 9
and Extended Data Fig. 5). Notably, similar to the CH proband with de novo MTOR
p.Glu1799Lys, the CH proband with the nearby transmitted p.His1782Arg variant had
macrocephaly, craniofacial abnormalities and skeletal abnormalities (Supplementary Table
11).


**_FOXJ1, FMN2 and PTCH1 harbor multiple DNMs and other inherited damaging variants._**

Three other LoF-intolerant genes harbored ≥2 damaging DNMs (Fig. 3, Supplementary
Table 12 and Extended Data Figs. 6–8). The forkhead family transcription factor FOXJ1
(Forkhead Box J1, pLI = 0.97) contained two LoF DNMs (p.Gln276X and p.Glu323fs)
surpassing thresholds for genome-wide significance (P = 1.4 × 10[−7]; Fig. 3, Table 1a and
Supplementary Table 12) and one inherited rare D-Mis mutation of uncertain significance
(p.Thr96Arg). All FOXJ1-mutated CH probands exhibit obstructive hydrocephalus with
aqueductal stenosis (Fig. 3, Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 13). Consistent
with these results, Foxj1 depletion in mice causes obstructive hydrocephalus and aqueductal
stenosis and disrupts a transcriptional network required for the differentiation of radial glial
NSC into multiciliated ependymal cells[32].


FMN2 (formin-2; pLI = 1.0) contained two DNMs (c.2137−2A>G and p.Glu846Gln; P =
4.4 × 10[−4]) and one inherited D-Mis variant of uncertain significance (p.Leu948Val) (Fig. 3,
Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 12) in CH probands with obstructive
hydrocephalus and aqueductal stenosis (Supplementary Table 13). None of the FMN2
mutations are present in gnomAD and Bravo. The CRYP-SKIP algorithm[33] suggests that the
canonical splice-site mutation c.2137−2A>G likely causes exon skipping (PCR-E = 0.30;

Extended Data Fig. 7). Both p.Glu846Gln and p.Leu948Val map to the proline-rich FH1
domain of formin-2 (Fig. 3)[34]. Fmn2 overexpression disrupts neuroepithelial integrity and
impairs NSC proliferation and neuronal migration in mouse embryos[35]. Fmn2 and FlnA
double knockout mice show significantly thinned cortices and microcephaly associated with
NSC proliferation[36].

We previously identified two LoF DNMs (c.1503+3A>G and p.Met152fs) in PTCH1
(Patched 1) among CH probands[9]. In our expanded cohort, we identified a total of seven
(including six new) rare, damaging transmitted or unphased PTCH1 variants in unrelated CH
probands (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 12), including an inherited
PTCH1 p.Leu664fs mutation in a CH proband who, like his transmitting mother, had Gorlin
syndrome. Two inherited D-Mis mutations (p.Pro1315His and p.Gly68Glu) and four
unphased D-Mis mutations (p.Gly866Arg, p.Pro1211Ser, p.Pro1272Ser and p.Pro1318Arg)
were of unknown significance (Supplementary Table 12). All D-Mis mutations in PTCH1
were rare and altered conserved residues with evident clustering of four of six altering
proline residues within a 107 amino acid segment of the carboxy terminus (Fig. 3). In
support of their pathogenicity, several CH probands with inherited or unphased PTCH1 DMis variants had phenotypes similar to patients with Gorlin syndrome with PTCH1 LoF
mutations, but did not meet formal criteria for Gorlin syndrome (Supplementary Table 13
and Extended Data Fig. 8). Consistent with these results, Ptch1[+/−] mice develop
hydrocephalus with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity[37]. Primary cilia sense
gradients of Sonic Hedgehog via PTCH1, which transduces these signals to regulate growth
and differentiation of hindbrain NSCs[38,39].


**_FXYD2 contains a significant burden of inherited dominant mutations, including a_**
**recurrent splice-site mutation.**

To identify additional haplo-insufficient genes associated with CH otherwise not revealed by
DNM analysis, we compared the observed and expected number of rare (minor allele
frequency (MAF) ≤ 5.0 × 10[−5]) heterozygous LoF mutations in each gene using a one-tailed
binomial test while adjusting for gene mutability (Methods). FXYD2 (pLI = 0.24), encoding
the regulatory γ-subunit of the Na[+]/K[+]-ATPase, surpassed genome-wide significance
thresholds (123.5-fold enrichment, P = 2.3 × 10[−6]; Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 9). No
DNMs or recessive mutations were observed in FXYD2. Case–control burden analysis for
rare LoF mutations in all probands versus gnomAD controls also identified FXYD2 as
having high mutational burden in CH probands (odds ratio = 49.3, one-sided Fisher’s exact
test, P = 4.8 × 10[−5]). Three unrelated CH probands exhibited two identical transmitted
canonical splice-site mutations in FXYD2 (c.299−1G>A) and one unphased FXYD2 splicesite mutation (c.410+1G>A) predicted by the CRYP-SKIP algorithm[33] to cause exon
skipping (Extended Data Fig. 9). The maximum haplotype shared by the two kindreds (~548
kb) suggests a remote common ancestor (Supplementary Table 14 and Supplementary Fig.
7). Recurrent heterozygous missense mutations in FXYD2 (p.Gly41Arg) underlie defective
Na[+]/K[+]-ATPase plasma membrane expression and function in autosomal dominant type 2
renal hypomagnesemia (OMIM no. 154020). All FXYD2 mutant CH probands shared
normal serum magnesium levels, and the majority displayed corpus callosum abnormalities
and cerebellar tonsillar ectopia (Supplementary Table 13).

**Recessive genotypes in homologs of mouse hydrocephalus genes are enriched in**
**consanguineous CH cases.**

The 8.7% consanguinity of our CH cohort (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig.
8) prompted evaluation for enrichment in CH probands of damaging recessive genotypes
(RGs) in homologs of 189 mouse hydrocephalus (mH) genes[8,40] (Supplementary Datasets 3
and 4; Methods). Among 90 damaging RGs among probands, six occurred in the mH gene
set, (P = 3.7 × 10[−3]) (Supplementary Table 15a). Enrichment of RGs in the mH gene set was
greater for LoF mutations (P = 4.9 × 10[−4]; Supplementary Table 16). Homozygous RGs new
for CH included one each in POMGNT1 (c.1111–1G>A), FKRP (D-Mis p.Gly354Glu),
RHPN1 (p.Met281fs), CEP290 (c.6012−2A>G), KCNG4 (p.Gly442Arg) and KIF19
(p.Gly859fs) (Supplementary Table 15b and Extended Data Fig. 10). All probands were
products of consanguineous union except the RHPN1 proband, P = 1.9 × 10[−3];
Supplementary Table 17), revealing a substantial contribution of RGs among probands from
consanguineous union (15.6%). Homozygous loss of each of these genes causes severe
postnatal hydrocephalus[8,40].


POMGNT1 and FKRP mutations cause human muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy,
characterized by hypotonia, seizures, retinal degeneration, cobblestone lissencephaly and,
rarely, ventriculomegaly[41]. A set of 12 human muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy
genes (Supplementary Dataset 5) was enriched among CH probands (P = 8.5 × 10[−5];
Supplementary Table 15a) and included POMGNT2, a gene with a homozygous
(consanguineous) LoF mutation (p.Tyr367X) whose depletion causes hydrocephalus in
humans and zebrafish (Supplementary Table 15b)[42]. Other pathway gene sets implicated in
syndromic hydrocephalus[8], including cilia structure and function (Supplementary Dataset 6),
cell adhesion (Supplementary Dataset 7), synaptic vesicle biology (Supplementary Dataset
8), planar cell polarity (Supplementary Dataset 9), Ras signaling (Supplementary Dataset
10), Wnt signaling (Supplementary Dataset 11), PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling
(Supplementary Dataset 12) and lysosomal storage (Supplementary Dataset 13) were not
enriched among CH probands (Supplementary Table 15a).


**CH risk genes converge in fetal human coexpression networks and cell types relevant for**
**fetal neurogenesis.**

Because animal and pre-clinical evidence suggests that many CH mutations disrupt NSC
regulation (Supplementary Table 18), we tested whether high-confidence, probable and/or
known human CH risk genes (Supplementary Dataset 14) converge in gene coexpression
networks of the midgestational human cortex (Methods)[43]. Notably, CH risk genes
converged in a single transcriptional network (‘yellow’ module; P = 1.19 × 10[−3]; Fig. 4a),
previously associated with ASD (Supplementary Dataset 15) and other undiagnosed
developmental disorders (DDs) (Supplementary Dataset 16)[43]. The top enriched Gene
Ontology (GO) biological process terms for the yellow module (Fig. 4b) include neuronal
[differentiation and RNA processing (for example, GO: 0000904 and GO: 0048667). The top](http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000904)

We also examined potential enrichment of CH risk genes in cell type markers of the largest
available single-cell (sc)RNA transcriptomic atlas of midgestational brain development[44 ]

(spanning 17–18 gestational weeks; Fig. 4c). High confidence and probable CH genes were
enriched in nascent migrating excitatory neurons (P = 9.98 × 10[−5]). Adding known human
genes to our cohort’s risk genes led to additional enrichment in mitotic progenitors PgS (P =
2.85 × 10[−3]) and PgG2M (P = 2.44 × 10[−3]). These data suggest that mutations in
biologically pleiotropic CH genes disrupt pathways that regulate neurogenesis in the
developing human brain.


**CH shares genetic risk factors with other neurodevelopmental disorders.**

The transcriptional overlap of risk genes for CH, ASD and DD during brain development
(Fig. 4a); the frequent presence of other neurodevelopmental phenotypes in patients with
CH;[45] and the association of ventriculomegaly with ASD[46] and other neurodevelopmental
conditions[47] prompted our hypothesis that sporadic CH may share common genetic risk
factors with ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions. Indeed, CH and ASD exhibited
significant overlap, with 7 genes harboring LoF DNMs and 20 genes harboring damaging
DNMs in both cohorts (Supplementary Table 19). CH and other DDs also exhibited
significant overlap, with 6 genes harboring LoF DNMs and 22 harboring damaging DNMs
in both cohorts (Supplementary Table 20). The data suggest partial overlap of genetic risk
factors among CH, ASD and other severe neurodevelopmental disorders.


### Discussion

Our WES study of the largest cohort of sporadic, neurosurgically treated CH to date has
coupled integrative genomics with deep clinical and neuroradiographic phenotyping to
uncover new insights into CH genetic architecture and biology with potential implications
for patient care. We show rare mutations with large effect contributed to 22.2% of CH cases
(17.7% damaging DNMs, 1.6% RGs, 0.8% transmitted heterozygous LoF variants). Overall,
2.1% of CH cases represented known familial CH mutations. Insertion-deletions,
rearrangements, noncoding variants and intronic splice mutations, also likely contribute to
genetic risk for CH and will be subjects of future studies. Additional CH cases may arise
from complex interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors.


We estimate from the distribution of protein-altering DNMs in LoF-intolerant genes that 34
genes contribute to CH via a DNM mechanism (Supplementary Fig. 9a; Methods). This
estimate is relatively low compared to the ~400 genes contributing to ASD and CHD,
respectively[48,49]. Simulations suggest that sequencing of 2,500 or 5,000 WES trios will
yield 90.3% or 97.6% saturation, respectively for CH (Supplementary Fig. 9b; Methods).
Sequencing of additional trios and isolated probands will therefore detect additional rare
mutations with a large effect on disease risk.

These results corroborate and significantly extend our previous work[9], with discovery of
new DNMs in TRIM71 and SMARCC1 as likely bona fide CH risk genes. We also provide
evidence that PIK3CA, PTEN, MTOR, FOXJ1, FMN2, PTCH1 and FXYD2 are new highconfidence sporadic CH genes, collectively accounting for ~7.3% of CH cases. The
phenotypes associated with each orthologous gene in corresponding zebrafish and/or murine

disease models support their roles in embryonic neurogenesis and CH pathogenesis
(Supplementary Table 18).

Clinical and neuroradiographic phenotyping of CH cases provides evidence for genotypespecific subtypes of CH. For example, TRIM71 and SMARCC1 likely define new
Mendelian CH syndromes based on clustering of distinctive features associated with each
gene (for example, cranial nerve deficits, nonobstructive interhemispheric cysts and hearing
loss associated with TRIM71, and aqueductal stenosis, cardiac and skeletal abnormalities
with SMARCC1). These observations support the pathogenicity of identified mutations and
suggest that phenotypic subsets of CH are influenced by specific genetic determinants. As
ongoing WES of deeply phenotyped trios continues, we anticipate emergence among CH
cases of different genetic disorders with predictable clinical histories and distinctive
neuroradiologic features. The phenotypic spectra of TRIM71, SMARCC1 and other CH risk
variants will also be better defined.


Several of the identified CH risk genes harboring damaging DNMs and inherited mutations
have been implicated in other Mendelian diseases, sometimes producing quite different
phenotypes. For example, three CH probands carried mutations in PTEN previously
implicated in PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (OMIM no. 607174), but none met criteria
for this or related PTEN disorders[25–27]. The same is true of a CH proband harboring an
MTOR mutation previously implicated in Smith–Kingsmore syndrome (OMIM no. 616638)
that did not meet criteria for this disorder[30]. Similarly, although the identical FOXJ1 DNMs
in our CH probands were recently identified in patients with type 43 primary ciliary
dyskinesia (OMIM no. 618699, associated with bronchiectasis and situs inversus)[50], none of
our FOXJ1 mutant patients exhibit these pulmonary or cardiac phenotypes. These
observations highlight the phenotypic heterogeneity and variable expressivity associated
with these gene mutations, which could arise from environmental modifiers, working in
concert with the identified rare mutations and/or specific genetic modifiers, including
mosaicism and other somatic mutations.

Our study also highlights how distinctive features of known Mendelian syndromes in
sporadic CH probands can be overlooked by clinical caregivers. For example, although four
out of five PIK3CA-mutated probands (all treated at different institutions across the country)
retrospectively met clinical criteria for MCAP, none carried a diagnosis before involvement
in our study. Similarly, we identified four new L1CAM mutations in men with CH with
aqueductal stenosis and classic stigmata of L1 syndrome (OMIM no. 307000) undiagnosed
due to unrecognized syndromic findings, along with lack of genetic testing. Our study’s
structure, including patient recruitment from a multitude of domestic and international
institutions, enabled a ‘real-life’ snapshot of CH care and diagnosis, with important
implications for genetic screening of newly diagnosed children with CH.


Much hydrocephalus research has centered on understanding the production, circulation and
reabsorption mechanisms of CSF. While these mechanisms are important for acquired
hydrocephalus in children and adults or in elderly patients with normal pressure
hydrocephalus, our data and much murine data[40] implicate earlier, more fundamental
genetic insults in CH. Notably, each high confidence CH gene harboring DNMs is highly

expressed in the neuroepithelium lining embryonic neural tube and/or ventricular (VZ) and
subventricular (SVZ) zones, where they regulate proliferation, differentiation and/or fate
specification of multipotent NSCs or rapidly proliferative neural precursors (Supplementary
Dataset 17). Genetic disruption of embryonic and fetal brain development is therefore the
primary event underlying CH pathogenesis in a significant subset of patients.

In this NSC model of CH pathogenesis (Fig. 5), nonobstructive ventriculomegaly can result
from impaired neurogenesis due to dysregulation in NSC pluripotency, leading to decreased
cortical cell mass and a thinned cortical mantle[51]. Obstructive ventriculomegaly can arise
from progressive CSF accumulation due to aqueductal obstruction from maldevelopment[52 ]

or to peri-aqueductal NSC hyperproliferation[53]. Other potential mechanisms include
impaired growth or size regulation of the ventricular apical domain of primary ciliacontaining radial glia NSCs[54] or impaired differentiation of radial glia NSCs into
multiciliated ependymal cells[32]. These primary genetic events impairing neuro-gliogenesis
could then secondarily disrupt CSF homeostasis by altering normal multiciliated ependymal
or possibly glia-lymphatic structure and function. Notably, germinal matrix hemorrhage in
premature neonates, the most common cause of acquired pediatric hydrocephalus, is
associated with impaired neurogenesis due to ependymal denudation and NSC damage in
the VZ-SVZ[55]. An NSC model could thus provide a ‘unified’ mechanism explaining
multiple forms of neonatal hydrocephalus, both congenital and acquired.


Consistent with mutations impacting fundamental aspects of fetal brain development,
associated phenotypes such as intellectual disability, neurodevelopmental delay, epilepsy and
autistic-like features are not infrequent findings among patients with CH[4], including those of
our cohort. In addition, ventricular enlargement in low-birth-weight infants is a risk factor
for ASD[56], including those with de novo PTEN mutations. We found enriched overlap of
genetic risk factors between CH and ASD and DDs, along with CH risk gene enrichment in
coexpression networks previously implicated in these conditions. However, analysis showed
convergence of CH risk genes in neural precursors of relatively earlier origin than those of
ASD and DDs[57], perhaps accounting for the increased frequency of structural brain
abnormalities in CH probands relative to these other disorders. The power of integrative
genomics to identify specific cell types and developmental pathways impacted by CH genes
will be increased as more high-confidence CH risk genes are discovered.

The diversity of genetic etiologies and underlying biochemical pathways in CH supports
implementation of routine clinical WES for newly diagnosed patients. Current
recommendations for workup of fetal/neonatal ventriculomegaly include rapid testing for
known chromosomal and copy-number abnormalities[58]. However, this strategy does not
address CH cases explained by known mutations. Application of routine WES or whole
genome sequencing would provide improved diagnosis and management of children with
CH. WES or whole genome sequencing could also aid prognostication, increase vigilance
for medical screening of mutation-associated conditions (such as cancer surveillance for
patients with CH with PIK3CA or PTEN) and provide recurrence rates to restore
reproductive confidence.

In the longer term, we speculate that WES of patients with CH, coupled with deep clinical
and neuroradiographical phenotyping, might improve precision of classification schemes to
prognosticate neurocognitive outcomes and stratify patients to specific treatments (such as
endoscopy versus CSF shunting versus pharmacological therapies). For example, in some
nonobstructive CH with excessively thinned cortical mantles from disrupted neurogenesis
and normal or even borderline moderately elevated ICPs, surgical CSF shunting may merely
expose patients with CH to surgical morbidity without addressing disease pathogenesis.
Surgical intervention in these contexts is unlikely to improve associated neurodevelopmental
phenotypes such as seizures, motor impairment or intellectual function, more likely arising
from genetic disruptions of embryonic neurogenesis than from reversible sequelae of CSF
accumulation. These observations should raise thresholds for surgical intervention (or
subsequent shunt revision) in patients with CH without radiographical obstruction, high
ICPs or high-pressure-associated symptoms.

Our data explain ~20% of CH cases; however, most sporadic CH cases remain unexplained.
Our current sample size still lacks statistical power adequate to detect the many rare,
inherited or sporadic CH-associated risk genes. Although our patients are mostly of
European origin, international collaborative studies will soon overcome our current
limitations of small cohort size and limited ethnic diversity. Moreover, mechanistic insights
into newly identified CH causal genes and core pathways will arise from in vivo experiments
in model organisms. Our current work identifying new human gene targets and CH-specific
mutations will serve as entry points for these functional studies. Successful pursuit of these
next steps will refine current heuristics for clinical decision-making and render personalized
treatments for patients with CH, including nonsurgical targeted therapies, a realistic goal.


### Methods

**Patients.**


All study procedures and protocols comply with Yale University’s Human Investigation
Committee and Human Research Protection Program. Written informed consent for genetic
studies was obtained from all participants. Inclusion criteria included patients with primary
CH who did not carry a genetic diagnosis before surgical treatment or inclusion in the study.
Subjects with either a known chromosomal aneuploidy or a copy-number variation with
known association to CH were also excluded. Hydrocephalus cases with secondarily
acquired etiologies such as intraventricular hemorrhage, meningitis or other central nervous
system infection, obstruction due to tumors or cysts and stroke were excluded. Children with
hydranencephaly, large cysts and cephaloceles, myelomeningocele (Chiari II malformation)
or benign extra-axial CSF accumulation (benign external hydrocephalus) were also
excluded. Sequenced trios were composed of 381 primary CH probands including 232
parent–offspring trios and 149 singletons (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). All probands had
undergone surgery for therapeutic CSF diversion (shunt placement and/or endoscopic third
ventriculostomy). Patients and participating family members provided buccal swab samples
(Isohelix SK-2S DNA buccal swab kits), medical records, neuroimaging studies, operative
reports and CH phenotype data.

Controls consisted of 1,798 unaffected siblings of people with ASD and unaffected parents
from SSC[60]. Only the unaffected siblings and parents, as designated by SSC, were included
in the analysis and served as controls for this study. Permission to access to the genomic data
in the SSC on the National Institute of Mental Health Data Repository was obtained. Written
informed consent for all participants was provided by the Simons Foundation Autism
Research Initiative.


**Whole-exome sequencing and variant calling.**

Exon capture was performed on genomic DNA samples derived from saliva or blood using
Roche SeqCap EZ MedExome Target Enrichment kit or IDT xGen target capture kit
followed by 101 or 148 base-paired-end sequencing on the Illumina platforms as described
previously[9,10]. Sequence reads were aligned to the human reference genome GRCh37/hg19
using BWA-MEM. Single-nucleotide variants and small indels were called using a
combination of GATK HaplotypeCaller[61,62] and Freebayes[63] and annotated using
ANNOVAR[64]. Allele frequencies were annotated in the Exome Aggregation Consortium,
gnomAD (v.2.1.1) and Bravo databases[65,66]. MetaSVM and MPC algorithms were used to
predict deleteriousness of missense variants (D-Mis, defined as MetaSVM-deleterious or
MPC-score ≥2)[67,68]. Inferred LoF variants consisted of stop-gain, stop-loss, frameshift
insertions/deletions, canonical splice site and start-loss. LoF and D-Mis mutations were
considered ‘damaging’. PCR amplicons containing the mutation verified mutations in genes
of interest.


DNMs were called using TrioDeNovo[69]. Candidate DNMs were further filtered based on the
following criteria: (1) exonic or splice-site variants; (2) read depth (DP) of 10 in the proband
and both parents; (3) minimum proband alternative read depth of 5; (4) proband alternative
allele ratio ≥28% if having <10 alternative reads or ≥20% if having ≥10 alternative reads; (5)
alternative allele ratio in both parents ≤3.5%; and (6) global MAF ≤ 4 × 10[−4] in the Exome
Aggregation Consortium database.

For recessive variant analysis, we filtered for rare (MAF ≤ 1 × 10[−3] in Bravo and in-cohort
MAF ≤ 5 × 10[−3]) homozygous and compound heterozygous variants that exhibited highquality sequence reads (pass GATK variant quality score recalibration, ≥4 total reads total
for homozygous and ≥8 reads for compound heterozygous variants, genotype quality (GQ)
score ≥10 for homozygous and GQ score ≥20 for compound heterozygous variants). Only
LoF, D-Mis and nonframeshift indels were considered potentially damaging to the disease.
For probands whose parents’ WES data were not available, only homozygous variants were
analyzed.


For rare heterozygous variants, only LoF and D-Mis mutations were considered to be
potentially disease associated and were filtered using the following criteria: (1) pass GATK
variant quality score recalibration; (2) MAF ≤ 5 × 10[−5] in Bravo and in-cohort MAF ≤5 ×
10[−3]; (3) DP ≥8 independent reads; and (4) GQ score ≥20. RGs and DNMs were excluded.

After filtering using the aforementioned criteria for each type of mutation, in silico
visualization was performed to remove false-positive calls. Variants in the top candidate
genes were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

**Quantification and statistical analysis.**

**DNM expectation model.—Because the CH trios were captured by two different reagents**
(MedExome and IDT), we took the union of all bases covered by different capture reagents
and generated a Browser Extensible Data file representing a unified capture for all trios. We
used bedtools (v.2.27.1) to extract sequences from the Browser Extensible Data file[70]. We
then applied a sequence context-based method to calculate the probability of observing a
DNM for each base in the coding region, adjusting for sequencing depth in each gene as
described previously[71]. Briefly, for each base in the exome, the probability of observing
every trinucleotide mutating to other trinucleotides was determined. ANNOVAR
(v2015Mar22) was used to annotate the consequence of each possible substitution. RefSeq
was used to annotate variants (based on the file ‘hg19_refGene.txt’ provided by
ANNOVAR). For each gene, the coding consequence of each potential substitution was
summed for each functional class (synonymous, missense, canonical splice site, frameshift
insertions/deletions, stop-gain, stop-loss and start-lost) to determine gene-specific mutation
probabilities[71]. The probability of a frameshift mutation was determined by multiplying the
probability of a stop-gain mutation by 1.25, as described previously[71]. In-frame insertions or
deletions are not accounted for by the model and were not considered in the downstream
statistical analyses. To align with ANNOVAR annotations, analysis was limited to variants
that were located in the exonic or canonical splice site regions and were not annotated as
‘unknown’ by ANNOVAR. Following the inclusion criteria, we identified potential coding
mutations and generated gene-specific mutation probabilities for 19,347 unique genes.
Owing to the difference in exome capture kits, DNA sequencing platforms and variable
sequencing coverage between case and control cohorts, separate de novo probability tables
were generated for cases and controls, respectively.


**Estimation of expected number of rare transmitted variants.—We implemented a**
multivariate regression model to quantify the enrichment of rare transmitted variants in a
specific gene or gene set in cases, independent of controls. Additional details about the
modeling of the distribution of recessive and transmitted heterozygous variant counts are
described in our recent study[48].

**De novo enrichment analysis.—The burden of DNMs in CH cases and unaffected ASD**
controls was determined using the denovolyzeR package[72] as previously described[48].
Briefly, the expected number of DNMs in case and control cohorts across each functional
class was calculated by taking the sum of each functional class-specific probability
multiplied by the number of probands in the study 2× (diploid genomes). Then, the expected
number of DNMs across functional classes was compared to the observed number in each
study using a one-tailed Poisson test[71]. Gene set enrichment analyses only considered
mutations observed or expected in genes within the specified gene set (high brain-expressed,
LoF-intolerant).


To examine whether any individual gene contains more protein-altering DNMs than
expected, the expected number of protein-altering DNMs was calculated from the
corresponding probability adjusting for cohort size. A one-tailed Poisson test was then used
to compare the observed DNMs for each gene versus expected. As separate tests were

performed for protein-altering, protein-damaging and LoF DNMs, the Bonferroni multipletesting threshold is, therefore, equal to 8.6 × 10[−7] (= 0.05 / (3 tests × 19,347 genes)).

To estimate the number of genes with multiple DNMs, one million permutations were
performed to derive the empirical distribution of the number of genes with multiple DNMs.
For each permutation, the number of DNMs observed in each functional class was randomly
distributed across the genome adjusting for gene mutability. The empirical P value was
calculated as the proportion of times that the number of recurrent genes from the
permutation equals or exceeds the observed number of recurrent genes as follows:


Empirical p −value =


∑i = 11M I( Pi ≥M)

1, 000, 000


**Enrichment analysis for dominant and recessive variants.—We implemented a**
polynomial regression model coupled with a one-tailed binomial test to quantify the
enrichment of damaging RGs in a specific gene or gene set in cases and controls, separately
as described previously[48]. The expectation of the RG count for each gene was calculated by
the formula below:


Expected RGi = N ×


Fitted valuei
∑GenesFitted value


where ‘i’ denotes the ‘ith’ gene and ‘N’ denotes the total number of RGs. For a given gene
set, the expected RG count was based on the sum of fitted values for the gene set.


Expected RGGene set = N ×


∑Gene setFitted value
∑GenesFitted value


For rare LoF heterozygous variants, we found that the number of rare LoF heterozygous
variants in a gene was inversely correlated with the pLI score obtained from the gnomAD
database. To control for the potential confounding effect due to the pLI score, we stratified
genes into five subsets by pLI quartiles: (1) those with a pLI score between 0 and the first
quantile (6.4 × 10[−8]); (2) those with a pLI score between the first quantile and the second
quantile (pLI = 1.9 × 10[−3]); (3) those with a pLI score between the second quantile and the
third quantile (pLI = 0.48); (4) those with a pLI score between third quantile and 1; and (5)
those without a pLI score. For each set, the expected number of LoF heterozygous variants
for a gene was estimated by the following formula:


Expected heterozygousj,k = Lk ×


mutabilityj
∑setkmutabilityj


where ‘j’ denotes the ‘jth’ gene, ‘k’ denotes the ‘kth’ set, and ‘L’ denotes the total number of
rare LoF heterozygous variants.

**Case–control burden analysis.—Case and control cohorts were processed using the**
same pipeline and filtered with the same criteria. A one-sided Fisher’s exact test was used to
compare the observed number of total alternative alleles, regardless of the transmission
pattern in cases to controls in the gnomAD (without disease-enriched TOPMed samples)
database.

**Determining gene lists.—The gene lists used for recessive enrichment analysis were**
curated as below. The mH genes were compiled by the association of their disease model,
[disease ortholog or phenotype with hydrocephalus per MGI (http://](http://www.informatics.jax.org/)
[www.informatics.jax.org/) (Supplementary Dataset 4). The dystroglycanopathies genes](http://www.informatics.jax.org/)
(Supplementary Dataset 5) and ciliopathies genes (Supplementary Dataset 6) were compiled
by Kousi and Katsanis[8]. Cell adhesion molecules (Supplementary Dataset 7), synaptic
vesicle cycle (Supplementary Dataset 8), Ras signaling pathway (Supplementary Dataset
10), Wnt signaling (Supplementary Dataset 11), PI3K–ATK–mTOR pathway
(Supplementary Dataset 12) and lysosomal storage disorder (Supplementary Dataset 13)
gene sets were curated based on KEGG and pathway database and the HUGO Gene
Nomenclature Committee. A planar cell polarity gene list (Supplementary Dataset 9) was
curated based on Wang et al.[73] and Tissir and Goffinet[74].


Gene lists from transcriptomic analyses were curated as below. Risk genes from our CH
cohort were defined as genes that harbored ≥1 inherited heterozygous LoF mutation of
genome-wide significance, genes intolerant to LoF mutations (pLI > 0.9) with ≥1 LoF DNM
and genes intolerant to missense mutations (mis-Z > 2) with ≥1 missense DNM. These genes
were categorized as high confidence if they harbored ≥1 inherited heterozygous LoF
mutation of genome-wide significance or ≥2 protein-altering DNMs; and as probable risk if
they harbored 1 protein-altering DNM. This yielded a high confidence set of 9
hydrocephalus genes (TRIM71, PTEN, PIK3CA, SMARCC1, FMN2, MTOR, FOXJ1,
PTCH1 and FXYD2) and a probable set of 55 genes.

We assembled lists of genes previously known to cause isolated and syndromic forms of
hydrocephalus in humans (Supplementary Dataset 14) from three publications: Kousi and
Katsanis[8] summarized over 100 genes described in known hydrocephalus syndromes[8], Furey
et. al. outlined new genes implicated in CH through WES[9] and Shaheen et. al. summarized
genes with recessive mutations linked to familial forms of CH[75].


We compiled a list of genes with rare risk variation in ASD from two papers: Ruzzo et. al.[76],
which describes genes harboring rare inherited variants and Satterstrom et. al.[77], which
describes genes with de novo variants and case–control variation (Supplementary Dataset
15). We compiled a list of developmental disorder (DD) risk genes from DDD 2017 (ref.[78]),
which describes genes enriched in damaging DNMs (Supplementary Dataset 16).

**Module enrichment.—Module gene lists were obtained from a bulk RNA-seq atlas from**
of the midgestational human prenatal cortex (14–21 gestational weeks)[43]. WGCNA[79] of this
atlas identified modules (labeled by color) of genes that share highly similar expression
patterns during midgestational cortical development[43]. In a background set of all genes
categorized in coexpression modules, we used a logistic regression for an indicator-based


Nat Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 February 09.


-----

enrichment: is.disease ~ is.module + gene covariates (GC content, gene length and mean
expression in bulk RNA-seq atlas), as described previously[43]. Of the 18 WGCNA modules,
the gray module, by WGCNA convention[80], contains all genes that do not coexpress and are
consequently unassigned to a coexpression network. Thus, the gray module was excluded
from enrichment testing and enrichment significance was defined at the Bonferroni multipletesting cutoff (α = 0.05 / 17 = 2.94 × 10[−3]).

**Module GO and HP profiling.—We used g:GOSt from g:Profiler, a tool for functional**
profiling of gene lists, to obtain descriptive terms for enriched modules[59]. We used all
annotated genes as the statistical domain scope, the g:SCS algorithm to address multiple
testing and P = 0.05 as a user-defined threshold for statistical significance. For each gene
list, we retained terms of 100–1,000 genes and we plotted the top 20 enriched terms from
GO biological process annotations and the top 20 enriched terms from HP ontology
annotations.


**Cell type enrichment.—Cell-type-enriched genes (cell type markers), were obtained**
from a scRNA-seq atlas that maps the human midgestational cortex (17–18 gestational
weeks)[44]. In a background set of all genes expressed in ≥3 cells of the scRNA-seq atlas, we
used a logistic regression for indicator-based enrichment: is.cell.type ~ is.disease + gene
covariates (GC content, gene length). All P values were adjusted with Bonferroni correction.
Enrichment significance was defined at the Bonferroni multiple-testing cutoff (α = 0.05 / 16
= 3.13 × 10[−3]).

**Overlap analysis.—As described previously[48], the permutation test was performed to**
assess the enrichment of overlapping genes with either damaging (D-Mis + LoF) or LoF
DNMs shared between CH and two other trio-based cohorts: autism and developmental
disorder. Given the observed numbers of genes with DNMs in the CH and other cohorts as
N1 and N2, respectively and the observed number of overlapping genes as M, we sampled
N1 genes from all genes in the CH cohort and N2 genes from all genes in the autism cohorts
without replacement using the probability of observing at least one DNM as weight. The
number of overlapping genes, G, was determined in each interaction of the simulation. A
total of 1,000,000 iterations were conducted to construct the empirical distribution. The
empirical number of overlapping genes was calculated by taking the average of the number
of overlapping genes across all iterations. The empirical P value was calculated as follows:


Empirical P value =


∑i = 11M I( Gi ≥M)

conserved residues in the 16th position of the respective first and fifth blades of NHL
domain, which mediates the binding to target mRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 2). p.Asn701Lys
localizes to the third NHL domain and is predicted to destabilize protein–RNA interactions
(Supplementary Fig. 2). RF, ring finger domain; CC, coiled-coil domain. The identified
SMARCC1 mutations were mapped in relation to its SWIRM and Myb-DNA-binding
domains, which mediate SMARCC1 interaction with BAF47 and its in vivo function in the
SWI-SNF and ADA complexes, respectively.

**Fig. 5 |. A neural stem cell model of sporadic CH.**
Schematic of the normal developing brain with the ventricular system surrounded by
parenchyma consisting of neurons, astrocytes and components of neurogenesis at the cellular
level (top). embryonic and fetal NSC populations, including neuroepithelial cells and radial
glia cells (rGCs), together generate virtually all neuronal and glial cells that populate the
brain, including multiciliated ependymal cells that line the ventricular system thought to
participate in CSF circulation and maintenance of ventricular integrity. Defects in embryonic
and fetal NSCs secondary to genetic mutations can thus drive CH via multiple pathogenic
mechanisms that impact development and maturation of different cell types. Schematic of
two possible developmental mechanisms of NSC alteration that may lead to
ventriculomegaly (bottom). In one hypothesized scenario (left), ventriculomegaly results

from impaired neurogenesis and an associated decrease in cortical cell mass that reflects a
reduction in NSC proliferation. Continued CSF production from the unaffected choroid
plexus would further expand the already enlarged ventricular compartment and even at low
hydrostatic pressure push the thin, low-resistance cortical ribbon to the dural–bone interface.
Ventricular enlargement and dysmorphology could then promote further ventricular
expansion through secondary disruption of normal linear CSF laminar flow, eliciting fluid
turbulence and current reversal. In another hypothesized scenario (right) that is not
necessarily mutually exclusive from the former, altered NSC regulation leads to
malformation of ependymal cells and their motile cilia, leading to impaired intraventricular
CSF circulation and attendant CSF accumulation responsible for progressive ventricular
dilation. Furthermore, defects in cilia-related genes may cause hydrocephalus not only by
impairing motile cilia-driven CSF flow, but also by affecting development of primary cilia,
which are nonmotile sensory organelles present on embryonic and fetal NSCs, crucial for
multiple developmental processes, including patterning, neurogenesis, migration and
survival. A combination of defects in NSC patterning and/or the proliferation–differentiation
balance can also introduce anatomical defects, resulting in physical obstruction to CSF flow,
such as aqueductal stenosis.
