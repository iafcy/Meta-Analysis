Objective: Congenital hydrocephalus is an important birth defect, the genetics of which remains

incompletely understood. To date, only four genes are known to cause Mendelian diseases in

which congenital hydrocephalus is the main or sole clinical feature, two X-linked (L1CAM and

_AP1S2) and two autosomal recessive (CCDC88C and MPDZ). In this study, we aimed to_

determine the genetic etiology of familial congenital hydrocephalus with the assumption that

these cases represent Mendelian forms of the disease.

Methods: Exome sequencing combined, where applicable, with positional mapping.

Results: We identified a likely causal mutation in the majority of these families (21/27, 78%),

spanning 16 genes, none of which is X-linked. Ciliopathies and dystroglycanopathies were the

most common etiologies of congenital hydrocephalus in our cohort (19% and 26%, respectively).

In one family with four affected members, we identified a homozygous truncating variant in

_EML1, which we propose as a novel cause of congenital hydrocephalus in addition to its_

suggested role in cortical malformation. Similarly, we show that recessive mutations in WDR81,

previously linked to cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and dysequilibrium syndrome 2, cause

severe congenital hydrocephalus. Furthermore, we confirm the previously reported candidacy of

_MPDZ by presenting a phenotypic spectrum of congenital hydrocephalus associated with five_

recessive alleles.

Interpretation: Our study highlights the importance of recessive mutations in familial congenital

hydrocephalus and expands the locus heterogeneity of this condition.

**INTRODUCTION**

Hydrocephalus is defined as an active distension of the ventricular system of the brain due to

inadequate passage of cerebrospinal fluid from its point of production within the cerebral

ventricles to its point of absorption into the systemic circulation [1]. Hydrocephalus is a highly

morbid condition if not managed appropriately to relieve the central nervous system from the

building pressure caused by a distended ventricular system. Environmental and genetic factors

are known to play a role in the etiology of hydrocephalus although their relative contribution

varies with age. For example, whereas infections are the leading cause of hydrocephalus in

children, single gene mutations are most commonly associated with congenital (prenatal)

hydrocephalus [2].

Congenital hydrocephalus is a severe birth defect affecting 4.65 per 10,000 births and is

associated with high morbidity and mortality [3, 4]. Although many syndromes can be associated

with congenital hydrocephalus, there are surprisingly very few genes that are known to cause the

disease as the sole or primary clinical feature [5]. L1CAM (MIM 308840) is the best known

disease gene in congenital hydrocephalus with an estimated contribution to as many as 30% of

suspected X-linked cases [6]. This gene has been linked to a number of neurological phenotypes

with or without congenital hydrocephalus, in addition to non-syndromic congenital

hydrocephalus [7]. AP1S2 (MIM 300629) is another X-linked gene that has been found to be

mutated in patients with congenital hydrocephalus, including those with phenotypes once

proposed to be allelic to L1CAM-related disorders [8, 9]. Much less is known about the autosomal

contribution to congenital hydrocephalus. In 2010, Ekici et al reported a homozygous truncating

mutation in CCDC88C in a consanguineous multiplex family, a finding that was independently

confirmed by a subsequent report [10, 11]. In 2013, we reported the identification of a novel locus

in two families with autosomal recessive congenital hydrocephalus [12]. A founder homozygous

truncating variant in MPDZ was identified in both families. No independent confirmation has

been published to date to confirm the candidacy of MPDZ.

Despite the identification of these four genes, the genetic landscape of congenital hydrocephalus

remains largely unexplored [13]. Previous studies have mostly targeted L1CAM sequencing in

cohorts of patients with congenital hydrocephalus [6, 14, 15]. Pursuing Mendelian causes of

congenital hydrocephalus is important because they can expand our knowledge of the molecular

underpinning of the disease. It is also a pre-requisite for the proper interpretation of genome

sequencing in patients with congenital hydrocephalus with the attendant benefit of precise

recurrence risk estimate. In this study, we report on the genomic analysis of a relatively large

cohort of families with recurrence of congenital hydrocephalus. Our results reveal marked

genetic heterogeneity, which we further expand by proposing EML1 and WDR81 as bone fide

disease genes in congenital hydrocephalus.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

**Human Subjects**

The cohort described in the study comprises families with at least two children who were

diagnosed with congenital hydrocephalus. Informed consent was obtained from all study

participants who were enrolled under an IRB-approved research protocol (KFSHRC RAC# 2080

006 and 2121 053). Additionally, we include three previously unpublished patients each with a

biallelic mutation in MPDZ diagnosed by clinical exome sequencing. Informed consent was

obtained to publish their clinical data by their respective institutions (Cincinnati Children’s

Hospital and The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto).

**Genomic Analysis**

All patients recruited through KFSHRC underwent autozygosity mapping irrespective of the

given history of consanguinity to investigate potentially unrecognized relatedness given the high

degree of inbreeding in Saudi Arabia. DNA samples from the all the affected patients were

genotyped using Axiom SNP chip array following the manufacturer’s instructions. This was

followed by genomewide autozygome analysis using runs of homozygosity >2Mb as surrogates

of autozygosity, as determined by AutoSNPa[16]. In parallel, the previously described

“Mendeliome assay” was applied to search for likely causal variants in previously reported

ciliopathy genes [17]. When negative, exome sequencing was pursued as follows. Exome capture

was performed using TruSeq Exome Enrichment kit (Illumina) following the manufacturer’s

protocol. Samples were prepared as an Illumina sequencing library, and in the second step, the

sequencing libraries were enriched for the desired target using the Illumina Exome Enrichment

protocol. The captured libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencer. The

reads were mapped against UCSC hg19 (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) by BWA (http://bio
bwa.sourceforge.net/). The SNPs and Indels were detected by SAMTOOLS

(http://samtools.sourceforge.net/). Variants from WES were filtered such that only novel (or

very low frequency <0.1%), coding/splicing, homozygous variants that are within the

autozygome of the affected individual and are predicted to be pathogenic were considered as

likely causal variants [18, 19]. Frequency of variants was determined using publically available

variant databases (1000 Genomes, Exome Variant Server, ExAC and gnomAD) as well as a

database of 4,577 in-house ethnically-matched exomes and gene panels. Pathogenicity was

been Sanger validated and their segregation with the disease confirmed in the respective families.

**RESULTS**

**Congenital Hydrocephalus is Genetically Heterogeneous**

A total of 27 families with recurrent congenital hydrocephalus were recruited (see Table S2 for

clinical details and Figure S1 for pedigrees). Genomic analysis revealed a likely causal variant

in the majority (21/27, 78%) of cases (Table S1). No mutations in L1CAM or AP1S2 were

identified even though six families only had affected males (see Figure S1, and Figure 2 for all

family pedigrees). Dystroglycanopathies was the most common disease category accounting for

26% of cases (7 families, 7 mutations in 6 genes). As shown in Table S2, most of these cases

were suspected clinically by the finding of elevated serum creatinine kinase (CK). Ciliopathies

was the second most commonly diagnosed category accounting for 19% of cases (5 families, 5

mutations in 5 genes). The ciliopathy cases met the diagnostic criteria of Meckel-Gruber

syndrome (n=4) or Acrocallosal syndrome (n=1).

Less known causes of congenital hydrocephalus identified included the recently identified

_KIAA1109-related Alkuraya-Reymond syndrome in families 12 and 19 with congenital_

hydrocephalus and severe arthrogryposis (revision in preparation), and PLAT-related

hydranencephaly and diaphragmatic hernia[18].

**Mutations in EML1 and WDR81 Cause Congenital Hydrocephalus**


**RESULTS**

_KIAA1109_

A homozygous truncating variant was identified in EM1L in family 22 IV:7 (Figure 1A). This is

a 2yr old girl with congenital hydrocephalus, profound global developmental delay, intractable

epilepsy, and positive family history (Figure 1 and Table S2). Brain MRI showed extensive

polymicrogyria, band heterotopia, agenesis of corpus callosum, dilated lateral ventricles,

compressed tentorium cerebelli and herniated cerebellar tonsil (Figure 1B-G). Exome

sequencing and homozygosity mapping revealed a nonsense mutation in EML1

(NM_004434.2:c.1567C>T, p. (Arg523*) (Figure 1H). The variant introduces a premature stop

codon in the two known NCBI Reference Sequence protein-coding transcripts (NM_004434.2

and NM_001008707.1) and has a CADD score of 37. It is absent in 4,577 ethnically matched

exomes and panels and ExAC as well as gnomAD database. Sanger sequencing confirmed the

segregation of the variant in all the unaffected siblings in the family. The variant is located at the

end of the N-terminal ß-propeller domain of the protein and is predicted to cause loss of the

largest part of C-terminal ß-propeller (Figure 1 H).

_WDR81 was found to be mutated in two families with severe congenital hydrocephalus (Figure 2_

A). Family 13 consists of a consanguineous couple who lost two pregnancies with severe

hydrocephalus and cerebellar hypoplasia (Figure 2 B and C). A homozygous truncating

mutation was identified in WDR81 NM_001163809.1: c.3286C>T, p. (Gln1096*) (Figure 2F).

Family 26 also consists of a consanguineous couple with history of a stillbirth diagnosed

antenatally with massive hydrocephalus and absent cerebellum. Similar findings were detected

on antenatal ultrasound of the subsequent pregnancy that resulted in a male neonate with severe

hydrocephalus and Dandy-Walker malformation (Figure 2D and E). A homozygous missense

variant in WDR81 was identified NM_001163809.1:c.845G>A, p. (Gly282Glu) (Figure 2F) that

**Confirming MPDZ as a bona fide Congenital Hydrocephalus Disease Gene**

Three families, in our cohort harbored the founder MPDZ truncating variant

NM_003829.3:c.628C>T, p. (Gln210*) (Table S1). We estimated the carrier frequency of this

mutation at 0.00044 (2 among 4,575 screened), which probably explains why this was the single

most common founder mutation in our cohort. Representative clinical images of the affected

members in families 4 and 24 with MPDZ mutation are shown in Figure 3A and 3B. Given the

lack of a second mutation in MPDZ in our cohort, we initiated an international collaboration to

seek additional pathogenic alleles and determine their clinical consequences. This collaboration

uncovered three previously unpublished cases that are described below:

Family 1 (The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto (SICK F1)): The proband is a 2.5 year old

girl born to a consanguineous Palestinian couple. Antenatal U/S revealed mild hydrocephalus,

polyhydramnios, and a two-vessel cord. Postnatal MRI showed dilatation of the lateral

ventricles and the third ventricle, and bilateral subependymal grey-matter heterotopia. There was

a soft tissue structure obliterating the cerebral aqueduct (Figure 3 C and D). Past-medical history

is also notable for a moderate ASD, right sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia and macular

hypoplasia. Fine motor skills and language are nearly within the normal range, but she had

delayed motor development. Dysmorphic features include frontal bossing, facial asymmetry, a

bulbous nose, persistent fetal pads and striking creases over her knees. Clinical exome

sequencing revealed a novel homozygous one base pair deletion in MPDZ with resulting

frameshift and premature truncation NM_001330637.1: c.4469delA, p. (Gln1490Argfs*19). The

parents were confirmed heterozygous carriers of the mutation.

Family 2 (The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto (SICK F2))): An 8 year old male was

referred to clinical genetics for multiple congenital anomalies (foveal dysplasia, portal vein

thrombosis, lung hypoplasia, aberrant subclavian artery, malrotation of the gut, and sensorineural

hearing loss). Parents are non-consanguineous of Scottish/Irish/Dutch descent with negative

family history. CT of chest at age 4m showed absence of the right upper lobe bronchus and

small unilobar right lung. Eye evaluation at age 3yrs showed foveal dysplasia, thin inner retina,

and bilateral lacrimal ducts stenosis. On examination at age 5.5 years, the following were noted:

two posterior hair whorls, downslanting palpebral fissures, posteriorly rotated ears,

microretrognathia, small teeth, joint hypermobility and normal neurological examination. MRI

brain showed small olfactory bulbs, minimal dilatation of the lateral brain ventricles which have

squared frontal horns and dilated occipital horns, multiple bilateral foci of subependymal nodular

grey matter heterotopia, an enlarged massa intermedia and possibly accessory commissures in

the third ventricle (Figure 3E and F). Clinical exome sequencing revealed two novel

heterozygous variants in MPDZ that confirmed to be inherited in trans:

(NM_001330637.1:c.2230C>T, p. (Arg744*) and c.3211C>T, p. (Arg1071*).

Family 3 (Cincinnati Children’s (CIN F1)): a 15 months old male referred from Kuwait for liver

transplant evaluation. He was a product of full term pregnancy but was born small for

gestational age (birth weight 2450 grams). He had prolonged NICU course due to cholestatic

jaundice and liver biopsy was consistent with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. He

was also found to have a small left multicystic dysplastic kidney. His echocardiography was

normal. Parents are first cousins and he has a healthy sister. On initial physical examination (15

months old) he was noted to have relative macrocephaly and a large full anterior fontanelle. He

also had bilateral iris coloboma, prominent optic nerve, hypotonia and reduced reflexes. Brain

MRI revealed enlarged third and lateral ventricles and extra-axial spaces, and increased signal

intensity within the central tegmental tracts and frontal horns which may represent areas of

localized hypomyelination or gliosis (Figure 3G and H). Although NGS panel revealed a likely

cause of his cholestasis (homozygous TJP2 NM_001170416.1: c.570_574dup, p.

(Leu192Profs*3)), we hypothesized that he has another distinct neurological disorder and

proceeded with clinical exome sequencing, which revealed, in addition to the pathogenic variant

in TJP2, a novel homozygous variant in MPDZ gene (NM_001330637.1: c.5278 G>A,

p.(Ala1760Thr)). The variant is absent in ExAC and predicted to be pathogenic (PolyPhen:

probably damaging (0.948), SIFT: deleterious (0.01) and CADD 34).

**DISCUSSION**

Although congenital hydrocephalus is known to be enriched for genetic causes compared to

other forms of pediatric hydrocephalus, little is known about the magnitude of this genetic

contribution. Small family size in the studied populations greatly limits recurrence even in

Mendelian forms of the disease. Furthermore, until recently only L1CAM has been known to

cause non-syndromic congenital hydrocephalus so studies on the genetics of the disease have

been largely limited to investigating sequence variants in this gene [20]. To our knowledge, our

study is the first to take a comprehensive genomic approach in the investigation of a cohort of

congenital hydrocephalus selected only on the basis of recurrence to enrich for Mendelian

causes.

Consistent with our prior experience in the study of genetics of recessive diseases [21-26], we found

a high hit rate of exome sequencing in the study cohort. Although recurrence in our cohort was

causes.


-----

not selected on the basis of autosomal recessive inheritance (some families had male-only

affected members), our analysis did not reveal any X-linked mutations. This is surprising when

one considers the reports of up to 74% of congenital hydrocephalus in families with male

recurrence caused by L1CAM mutations [6]. This may be explained by the significant contribution

of autosomal recessive mutations to the etiology of recurrent congenital hydrocephalus in our

cohort. In addition, we note that the strictly familial nature of our cohort limits the contribution

of de novo L1CAM mutations, although these account for a very small percentage of previously

reported mutations [15].

_EML1 encodes a microtubule-binding protein that influences planar polarity. It has been shown_

to determine the mitotic plate angle of neuroprogenitors in relation to the periventricular

germinal zone protein, and that its deficiency causes abnormal migration pattern with resulting

band heterotopia in mouse [27]. In that same study, two missense, likely hypomorphic variants in

_EML1 were identified in two patients with band heterotopia [27]. The family in this study has, in_

addition to band heterotopia, severe congenital hydrocephalus in several affected members. We

posit that the severe, potentially null, nature of the mutation resulted in a much more severe

migration disorder and abnormal posterior fossa configuration with resulting “distal”

hydrocephalus. Thus, not only does our study provide the first independent confirmation of

_EML1 involvement in band heterotopia in humans, but it also expands the phenotype to also_

include severe congenital hydrocephalus.

Similarly, our study expands the phenotypes associated with WDR81 to also include severe

congenital hydrocephalus with cerebellar hypoplasia. In 2011, Gulsuner and colleagues reported

a single consanguineous family with quadrupedal locomotion, mental retardation, and cerebro
cerebellar hypoplasia (CAMRQ) in which they identified a homozygous missense variant in

_WDR81_ [28]. Although this association has not been independently confirmed by follow up reports

in humans, this finding helped in the mapping of an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutant

mouse with Purkinje fiber degeneration to a missense variant in WDR81 [29]. Unlike the mutation

reported in the context of CAMRQ (P856L) and the mouse mutation (L1349P), we report the

first truncating mutation Gln45*, which may explain the much more severe phenotype we

observed in this family. Surprisingly, the same severe phenotype was observed in the other

family we report with a homozygous missense variant, which suggests that this variant is an

equally severe loss of function mutation. The independent identification of likely causal

mutations in WDR81 in two families with a strikingly similar phenotype comprising a lethal form

of congenital hydrocephalus with cerebellar hypoplasia strongly support the notion that WDR81

is a bone fide autosomal recessive disease gene for this phenotype.

We have originally reported MPDZ in two families (one with long term survival to adulthood)

with a remarkably consistent phenotype comprising severe congenital hydrocephalus with

variable penetrance of heterotopia, coloboma and ASD [12]. Lack of subsequent reports and the

suggestion that MPDZ mutation may result in an eye-limited phenotype cast doubt on the

original link to congenital hydrocephalus [30]. However, we show in this study that the founder

mutation in MPDZ is the most commonly encountered mutation in familial congenital

hydrocephalus, consistent with its relatively high carrier frequency. More importantly, we report

three additional patients each with a novel biallelic variant in MPDZ that is likely deleterious and

they all share the core feature of hydrocephalus, albeit of variable severity. Patient 1 also

features coloboma, strabismus and ASD, and Patient 2 features coloboma that we reported at

variable penetrance in the original families. In addition, all additional families appear to share

Our study is not designed to be generalizable to all forms of congenital hydrocephalus.

However, it seems reasonable to recommend that a prenatally diagnosed hydrocephalus should

be aggressively investigated for the possibility of a Mendelian cause. Exome sequencing of

these cases is warranted given the broad differential diagnosis and the high yield of this

diagnostic tool in the setting of Mendelian forms of the disease. While others have

recommended L1CAM sequencing in all cases of congenital hydrocephalus, we believe the

decreasing cost of exome sequencing and the genetic heterogeneity of the condition warrant

considering exome sequencing as the first-tier test in these patients. The unsolved cases in our

series may represent non-Mendelian familial aggregation [31]. Alternatively, they may harbor

challenging classes of Mendelian mutations that evaded detection using our standard filtering

strategy and these will be subject to deeper scrutiny in the near future.

In summary, our results show a remarkably high contribution of recessive mutations to familial

congenital hydrocephalus that clearly surpass that of L1CAM, at least in our study population.

We provide independent confirmation of MPDZ as a bona fide congenital hydrocephalus disease

gene, and expand the phenotype of EML1 and WDR81 to also include congenital hydrocephalus

in severe cases. We encourage the use of exome sequencing to investigate an underlying genetic

cause of congenital hydrocephalus, especially in familial cases.
