_What are the novel findings of this work?_
In this study of 114 cases that underwent termination of
pregnancy following the detection of a major central nervous system anomaly, chromosomal microarray analysis
(CMA) detected causative copy-number variants (CNVs)
in 10% of fetuses. Among 86 CMA-negative cases, exome
sequencing (ES) detected causative sequence variants in
44%. The ES bioinformatics pipeline also detected 13 of
the causative and previously known non-causative CNVs.

_What are the clinical implications of this work?_
Our data suggest that ES could be considered as a first-tier
clinical diagnostic test in the prenatal diagnosis of fetuses
with major CNS anomalies, as it can detect both sequence
variants and CNVs.

apparently isolated defect to multisystem malformations.
A karyotype abnormality is found in 8–10% of cases with
such an anomaly that undergo diagnostic testing, and a
copy-number variant (CNV) is identified in an additional
6%, leaving the majority of cases without a specific
genetic diagnosis[1–4]. This is because many anomalies have
monogenic etiology (i.e. a single-gene disorder caused
by a point mutation or small insertion/deletion)[1]. The
detection of such genetic aberrations requires much higher
resolution, which can be achieved only by next-generation
sequencing technology, such as targeted multigene panels,
exome sequencing (ES) or whole-genome sequencing. ES
is sometimes applied as a second- or third-tier diagnostic
test in selected cases of fetal anomaly. Recent work has
shown that ES provides an additional yield of 5–57%
over that of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) in
the prenatal setting[5–9].
The central nervous system (CNS) is affected in 9% of
fetal malformations but accounts for as much as one-third
of all pregnancy terminations due to fetal anomaly.
Moreover, CNS abnormalities are often diagnosed late
in pregnancy[10]. When applying conventional methods
(karyotyping followed by CMA or CMA alone) to the
diagnosis of fetal CNS anomalies, the estimated diagnostic
yield does not exceed 20%[11–13]. Thus, more than 80% of
cases remain without a genetic diagnosis, probably owing
to a large proportion of cases having monogenic etiology.
In this study, we compared the diagnostic yield of ES
and CMA in fetuses with a major CNS anomaly leading
to termination of pregnancy. In addition, we sought to
determine the diagnostic yield for specific categories of
CNS anomaly.

**METHODS**

This was a retrospective study of all cases referred to our
institution for genetic evaluation following termination
of pregnancy due to a major fetal CNS anomaly
between 2014 and 2021. All patients underwent detailed
neurosonographic examination in orthogonal planes,
as described previously[14], at the Division of Obstetric
Ultrasound at the Lis Maternity Hospital, Tel Aviv
Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel, which is a
tertiary referral center for fetal CNS anomalies. Patients
then received comprehensive genetic counseling at the
Prenatal Genetic Diagnosis Unit of the Genetics Institute.
Following counseling, patients signed a standard clinical
consent form for genetic testing.
Clinical data were retrieved retrospectively from
electronic medical records at the Genetics Institute
and prenatal ultrasound reports, as well as fetal brain
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, were also
retrieved when available. All patient information was
anonymized. Families with recurrent CNS anomalies
were considered as a single case. Cases were further
subcategorized according to clinical findings. Cases with
multiple brain anomalies were categorized as ‘complex’,
while cases with additional extracranial anomalies
were categorized as ‘multisystem’. Cases in which the


anomaly affected only one brain developmental process
were described separately according to the category,
as determined by consensus: malformation of cortical
development, midline anomaly (corpus callosal, septal,
holoprosencephaly), brain cyst (subependymal, arachnoid), midbrain–hindbrain malformation and neural tube
defect. These cases were defined as ‘isolated severe CNS
malformations’. Of note, mild isolated findings, such as
mild ventriculomegaly, were not included in this study.
Hydrocephalus secondary to aqueductal stenosis was
considered a midbrain–hindbrain anomaly. Brain damage
was not considered an isolated anomaly if the insult
affected different regions of the brain simultaneously.

**Genetic analysis**

As routine practice, all cases of fetal anomaly subjected
to termination of pregnancy underwent DNA extraction
from amniotic fluid or fetal blood (obtained during feticide). Extraction from blood always produced sufficient
DNA. Direct extraction following amniocentesis usually
suffices for both CMA and ES, but, occasionally, cell
culture is needed if both analyses are to be performed.
All cases were first analyzed by CMA, some prior
to termination of pregnancy and some as part of
the post-termination work-up. CMA was performed
using a CytoScan 750K array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
CA, USA). The platform is composed of 550 000
non-polymorphic CNV probes and more than 200 000
single-nucleotide polymorphism probes, with an average
resolution of 100 kb. Analysis was performed using
the Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software v 3.1
(Affymetrix). Detected CNVs were classified as either
pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), benign, likely
benign or as a variant of uncertain clinical significance
(VOUS), according to the updated American College of
Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Clinical
Genome Resource (ClinGen) guidelines[15]. A genomic map
from the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome
Browser[16] was used to map the locations of CNVs
and gene content according to build hg19/GRCh37. The
Database of Genomic Variants[17], as well as our internal
database, provided catalogs of structural variations found
in healthy controls.
All patients with a negative CMA result received further
genetic counseling and were offered ES trio analysis.
CMA-positive cases were reanalyzed using ES to assess its
ability to detect CNVs. DNA samples from parents–fetus
trios underwent ES. The first 15 cases were outsourced
to external accredited clinical laboratories (Centogene or
CeGat, Germany). Cases 1–5 have been reported previously[18]. The majority (71 initially evaluated cases and 10
reanalyzed cases (84%)) were sequenced and analyzed at
the Tel Aviv Sourasky Genomics Center. Sequencing was
performed on a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, San
Diego, CA, USA) with 100-bp paired-end reads.
The entire bioinformatics pipeline from FASTQ files
to the final report was performed using the Franklin
genetic analysis platform (Genoox, Tel Aviv, Israel).

FASTQ files were aligned against the hg19/GRCh37
reference genome using BWA v 0.7.16[19]. Variant calling
for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels was
performed using Genome Analysis Toolkit v 4.0.12.0[20]

and FreeBayes v 1.1.0[21].
In addition to SNVs and small indels, the Franklin
pipeline also detects CNVs using Genoox proprietary
CNV-caller, which mainly utilizes coverage information
and is expected to detect CNVs down to a resolution of
two exons in the heterozygous state and a single exon in
the homozygous state[22].
Sequence variant annotation, classification and prioritization, as well as CNV classification, were performed
using Franklin according to ACMG guidelines[15,23].
The bioinformatics analysis was based solely on the
prenatal phenotype. The minimal criteria for a sample
to be included in the analysis were average coverage
of 70 × and at least 98% of variants with a quality
score above 40. Family-case analysis was prepared
considering different possible modes of inheritance. The
variants were filtered, retaining the following: (1) rare
variants with minor allele frequency < 5%; (2) proteinaltering variants; (3) variants in coding regions or those
up to 10 bp from splice junctions; (4) variants with
a high or medium aggregated quality score. Variants
were prioritized by Franklin based on their degree of
pathogenicity and clinical information transcribed into
Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms[24].

**Statistical analysis**

Statistical analysis was performed using Social Science
Statistics[25]; P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance.

**RESULTS**

The study included 114 consecutive cases following termination of pregnancy due to a major fetal CNS anomaly.
MRI was performed in 25 cases at a median gestational
age of 30 weeks. Postmortem confirmation of the imaging findings was obtained in 21 cases. All fetuses were
first analyzed by CMA. Eleven (10%) cases had a P/LP
CNV (Figure 1), most of which were deletions harboring haploinsufficient genes (Table 1). These included nine
_de-novo CNVs, one case of triploidy and a case with_
a terminal deletion of 3p26.1 and a terminal duplication of 8q24.3, compatible with an unbalanced reciprocal
translocation. In the latter case, parental karyotyping
revealed that the mother carried a balanced translocation
46,XX,t(3;8)(p26.1;q24.3), conferring a significant risk
of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies.
Of the 103 CMA-negative cases, 13 patients declined
further analysis by ES and, in four other cases, there
was insufficient fetal DNA for further analysis (Figure 1).
The remaining 86 cases underwent ES analysis. These
included 82 fetus–parents trios, one solo fetal analysis,
one fetus–mother duo and two quatros including both
parents and two affected fetuses. P/LP (Class V/IV)

sequence variants were detected in 38/86 (44%) cases
(Table 2). In nine (10%) additional cases, a VOUS with
potential clinical relevance was reported (Table S1). In the
remaining 39 cases, no variant was reported (Table S2).
The incidence of P/LP sequence variants was
non-significantly higher among the recurrent cases (i.e.
cases with a previously affected pregnancy) compared
with non-recurrent cases (12/19 (63%) vs 26/67 (39%),
χ-square statistic = 3.56, P = 0.06). No difference in the
incidence of P/LP sequence variants was noted between
cases with an anomaly limited to the CNS and those with
multisystem abnormalities (24/54 (44%) vs 14/32 (44%)).
Of the cases with an ES diagnosis, 20/38 (53%) were
inherited and carried a significant risk of recurrence (eight
autosomal recessive (AR), five autosomal dominant (AD)
and seven X-linked cases). The remaining 18 cases had a
_de-novo heterozygous variant in an AD or X-linked gene._
To evaluate the detection rate in different clinical
categories, cases were subcategorized (Table 3). The
highest diagnostic yield was observed in cases categorized
as having multisystem (14/32 (44%)) and complex
brain (14/24 (58%)) anomalies. Cases with specific
isolated brain anomalies were too few to draw definitive
conclusions. As a group, cases with isolated severe
CNS malformation had the lowest diagnostic yield (7/21
(33%)), as did cases with brain damage (3/9 (33%)).
To assess whether the bioinformatics pipeline employed
for SNV analysis (Franklin) can detect CNVs, we
performed ES analysis in 10 of the 11 cases detected by
CMA (Cases 9, 11, 15, 17, 18, 27, 47, 53, 63 and 71). In
Case 54, there was insufficient DNA for ES analysis. Three
additional cases had incidental, non-causative CNVs
(Cases 16, 86 and 107). The CNV size ranged from
335 kb to 19 080 kb, and all CNVs were called correctly
by the bioinformatics analysis pipeline. Triploidy of Case
15 was not detected directly by the pipeline. However,
the homozygous/heterozygous ratio, a quality control
metric, was 0.34, far below the normal range (0.45–0.80),
suggesting such an abnormality.
In summary, 96 cases had undergone ES analysis (86
CMA-negative cases and 10 reanalyzed CMA-positive

cases). Thus, the combined detection rate of ES for both
sequence variants and CNVs was 50%.

**DISCUSSION**


In the postnatal setting, ES has demonstrated an
additional diagnostic yield for a variety of conditions of
25–45% beyond traditional methods. Multiple studies
have also shown the efficacy of ES in the prenatal
diagnosis of various fetal anomalies[5–7,12,26–32]. In a recent
meta-analysis, the diagnostic yield for a variety of fetal
anomalies, regardless of the affected organ, was 9–47%[33].
A higher rate was noted for fetuses showing multiple
malformations[33]. Several studies have reported that, in
cases with a CNS anomaly, the added diagnostic yield
is 3–34%[6,7,12,18,30,34]. Finally, there are only a handful
of studies focusing specifically on CNS anomalies, with a
diagnostic yield ranging from 19% to 50%[35–38].
In our study, the added diagnostic yield of ES
was 44%, with the highest yield observed in specific
subcategories (44% in multisystem and 58% in complex
brain anomalies). There was a non-significant trend
towards a higher incidence of monogenic etiology in cases
with recurring brain anomalies compared with first-time
cases (63% vs 39%; P = 0.06). There was a significant risk
of recurrence in 53% of cases that had an ES diagnosis.
This information will be important for future reproductive
choices. Several participating couples have already opted
for preimplantation genetic testing (PGT).
In several cases with genetic etiology, we detected
P/LP variants in AR genes that were in concordance
with clinical manifestations. For example, Case 46 with
_POMT1 variant and Case 50 with POMGNT2 variant_
were suspected to have Walker–Warburg syndrome
(OMIM 236670, 614830) (Table 2). However, in some
cases, clinical manifestations did not correspond to the
phenotype associated with the detected AR variants.
For example, pathogenic variants in _VRK1_ cause
pontocerebellar hypoplasia Type 1A (PCH1A, OMIM
[607596), characterized postnatally by hypoplasia of the](https://omim.org/entry/607596)
ventral pons and cerebellum and neuronal loss and gliosis
in the brainstem and basal ganglia. However, prenatally,
Case 5 with a homozygous VRK1 variant exhibited

a dysplastic corpus callosum (CC), delayed sulcation
and cerebellar hypoplasia. This highlights the fact that
prenatal manifestations may differ and be more severe
when compared with those described postnatally. There is
a need to expand the HPO terminology to include accurate
prenatal manifestations. Such efforts are currently being
undertaken by the Fetal Sequencing Consortium[39].
Moreover, this suggests that accurate diagnoses cannot
rely on imaging alone, and that sequencing information
provides additional important insights.
As expected, of the 22 cases with an AD mode of
inheritance, 17 (77%) cases were de novo. Nonetheless,
consideration should be given to the five inherited AD
cases. In two maternally inherited cases, tubulinopathy
was detected. In Case 3, a TUBB3 (OMIM 614039) LP
missense variant was detected in a fetus with cortical
dysplasia and abnormal sulcation. In Case 62, a TUBB
(OMIM 615771) LP missense variant was found in a
fetus with CC hypoplasia, asymmetric hemispheres, ventriculomegaly, mega cisterna magna and colpocephaly. In
Case 97, a de-novo LP missense variant in the TUBA1A
gene (OMIM 611603) was found in a fetus with cortical dysplasia, abnormal cortical gyration and brainstem
abnormality. Pathogenic variants in the tubulin isotypes
are associated with various types of complex cortical dysplasia with other brain malformations. Perturbation of
the tubulins may be associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders with incomplete penetrance[40].
In Case 61, a maternally inherited DCC (OMIM 157600)
loss-of-function variant was detected. On further examination, the otherwise unaffected mother was found to
have mirror hand movements, a well-described phenomenon associated with this gene[41]. The fetus, however,
was found to have partial agenesis of the CC, which
is another known consequence of DCC mutations[42].
In Case 73, a paternally inherited COL4A2 (OMIM
614483) deletion was associated with Grade IV intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in the index fetus and
in the fetus in a previously terminated pregnancy. The
carrier father had cerebral palsy (CP), most likely as a
consequence of in-utero IVH. The father’s niece, who also
had CP, carried the same pathogenic variant. In Case
40, the fetus presented with Chiari Type-II malformation
secondary to a neural tube defect. ES analysis revealed
a maternally inherited stop codon in the SCRIB gene
(OMIM *607733). Variants in SCRIB and other planar
cell polarity genes have been associated with neural tube
defects in animals[43] and humans[44,45]. The healthy mother
had no clinical signs of a neural tube defect. These cases
highlight the fact that even pathogenic variants may have
variable expression and incomplete penetrance and stress
the importance of obtaining a full medical history and
examining other family members.
In addition to the 44% diagnostic yield of P/LP variants,
nine (10%) other cases had a VOUS with potential clinical
relevance (Table S1). Such VOUSs may prove over time
to be benign or unrelated to the clinical scenario owing to
data-sharing tools such as GeneMatcher[46] or the Franklin
Users Community[47].


Our study has some limitations. First, our series consists
of highly selected cases that were severe enough to warrant
termination of pregnancy. Thus, our conclusions may not
apply to all brain anomalies. Second, the study was carried
out at a referral center for prenatal CNS anomalies and,
as such, may have had selection bias due to severe and/or
recurrent cases being more likely to have genetic etiology.
Third, conclusions regarding specific clinical subgroups
are limited owing to a relatively small number of cases in
each subcategory.
In conclusion, we have shown that, in fetuses with
major CNS anomalies, ES has an additional diagnostic
yield of 44% over the 10% provided by CMA. Because ES
can also detect many CNVs and given the tight timeframe
in pregnancy, we suggest that ES should be considered
as a first-tier test in the prenatal diagnosis of major
CNS anomalies. Given the limited prenatal phenotype
information, the additional prognostic information
provided by ES is crucial for timely and evidence-based
decision-making. Moreover, given that over half of the
causative variants are inherited, their detection by ES
provides valuable information regarding the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies and facilitates counseling
regarding reproductive choices, such as prenatal diagnosis
or PGT. Further studies are needed to assess whether ES
alone could be used for reliable CNV detection.
