Purpose: We compared the diagnostic yield of fetal clinical exome sequencing (fCES) in pro-
spective and retrospective cohorts of pregnancies presenting with anomalies detected using
ultrasound. We evaluated factors that led to a higher diagnostic efﬁciency, such as phenotypic
category, clinical characterization, and variant analysis strategy.
Methods: fCES was performed for 303 fetuses (183 ongoing and 120 ended pregnancies, in
which chromosomal abnormalities had been excluded) using a trio/duo-based approach and a
multistep variant analysis strategy.
Results: fCES identiﬁed the underlying genetic cause in 13% (24/183) of prospective and 29%
(35/120) of retrospective cases. In both cohorts, recessive heterozygous compound genotypes
were not rare, and trio and simplex variant analysis strategies were complementary to achieve
the highest possible diagnostic rate. Limited prenatal phenotypic information led to interpreta-
tion challenges. In 2 prospective cases, in-depth analysis allowed expansion of the spectrum of
prenatal presentations for genetic syndromes associated with the SLC17A5 and CHAMP1 genes.
Conclusion: fCES is diagnostically efﬁcient in fetuses presenting with cerebral, skeletal, urinary,
or multiple anomalies. The comparison between the 2 cohorts highlights the importance of
providing detailed phenotypic information for better interpretation and prenatal reporting of
genetic variants.

Introduction
Ultrasound detection of fetal abnormalities, which occurs in
approximately 2% to 4% of pregnancies,1,2 is an essential
part of routine obstetrical care. When fetal structural
anomalies are suspected, invasive procedures (ie, amnio-
centesis, chorionic villus sampling [CVS]) are offered for
prenatal genetic diagnosis. Historically, karyotype testing
was the ﬁrst-line method to investigate chromosomal
anomalies, providing a diagnosis in approximately 30% of
fetuses with abnormal ultrasound ﬁndings.3 With the
introduction of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA),
the diagnostic rate of chromosomal anomalies increased by
4% to 7%.3-5 However, the search for a genetic diagnosis in
the remaining cases was costly and time-consuming before
the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS). The
encouraging results of exome sequencing (ES) in pediatric
patients6-10 raised interest for its application in a prenatal
setting. Since 2014, several studies comprising small and
selected cohorts of aborted fetuses reported high diagnostic
yields (in the range of 50%-80%).11-15 Recently, 2 large and

unselected prospective cohorts were reported with a lower
diagnostic rate (8%-10%).16,17 As the use of ES increases in
prenatal care, medical professionals (eg, referring physi-
cians, laboratory geneticists, genetic counselors) are faced
with complex technical and ethical challenges that must be
addressed collectively.18
Herein we report fetal clinical exome sequencing (fCES)
in a series of 303 pregnancies displaying abnormal ultra-
sound ﬁndings (with no selection of the type of fetal
anomalies) and normal quantitative ﬂuorescent–polymerase
chain reaction and CMA results, including 183 pregnancies
for which the diagnosis was obtained during the pregnancy
and hence contributed to the clinical decision process.
Importantly, the retrospective and prospective analyses were
carried out by the same center and in the same time frame,
allowing direct comparison of the diagnostic yields between
the 2 cohorts. In particular, we discuss the effect of the
availability of detailed phenotypic information for the
establishment of genetic diagnoses through fetal NGS-based
analyses. In addition, our series expanded the range of fetal
phenotypes investigated by genome-wide methods because
it included fetuses presenting with anomalies detected using
ultrasound anomalies that have rarely been explored by
NGS (ie, intrauterine growth restriction, amniotic ﬂuid ab-
normalities) and uncovered novel associations between
known genotypes and fetal phenotypes. Finally, our study
aimed to share data analysis workﬂow strategies and inter-
pretation challenges.
Materials and Methods
Study design and participants
Patients were recruited from 14 centers (Supplemental
Table 1) between October 2016 and June 2020, and their
enrollment was conducted in parallel for both cohorts.
However, because of a long turnaround time (TAT) at the
beginning of the study, the cases recruited initially mostly
consisted of interrupted pregnancies. The study design is
summarized in Figure 1A. For the retrospective study cohort,
couples who had experienced a pregnancy characterized by
fetal anomalies for which the fetal sample was available were
recruited. For the prospective study cohort, on detection of
fetal structural anomalies during a routine ultrasound exam-
ination, parents who opted for invasive testing were offered
participation. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same
for both cohorts. Inclusion criteria were increased nuchal
translucency (NT) (>99th percentile and/or ≥3.5 mm at 11-
14 weeks ultrasound scan), amniotic ﬂuid anomalies, or any
major structural fetal malformation(s). Exclusion criteria
were fetuses presenting isolated soft markers (Supplemental
Table 2), known monogenic disease within the family,
identiﬁcation of an etiology (chromosomal abnormality,
infection) explaining the fetal phenotype, and simplex cases
for which no parental DNA was available (ie, only trio/duo
analysis was performed). Families were informed about the
technical aspects and the limitations of the study by a clinical
geneticist or a trained gynecologist, and written informed
consent was obtained. The parents could opt in or out of the
return of incidental ﬁndings. This study was approved by the
ethical committee of the Hˆopital Erasme, Brussels, Belgium,
under the reference P2016/236.
Clinical data collection
In the retrospective study, information about fetal pheno-
types was collected from imaging data and postmortem
examinations when available and used for genotype–phe-
notype correlation during fCES analysis. In the prospective
study, fCES interpretation was based on imaging data
available at the time of the analysis. Retrospectively, clinical
data were reviewed in all cases, and phenotypes were an-
notated using Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) (https://
hpo.jax.org/app/) terms,19 allowing classiﬁcation in several
phenotypic categories (Supplemental Table 3).
fCES
Library preparation and sequencing
In the prospective study, fetal DNA was obtained from
CVS, amniotic ﬂuid, or fetal blood that remained unused
after routine investigations. When the amount of DNA from
these samples was insufﬁcient, DNA was extracted from
cultured samples. In the retrospective study, cultured ﬁbro-
blasts or fetal biopsies were used for DNA extraction if no
other type of sample was available. Parental blood samples
were also collected for DNA extraction. In all prenatal
samples, maternal contamination and presence of the most
common
aneuploidies
were
excluded
by
quantitative
ﬂuorescent–polymerase chain reaction (Elucigene QST*R
Plus v2, Elucigene Diagnostics). CMA on a CytoSure
Constitutional v3 8×60k array (Oxford Gene Technology)
was performed to exclude copy number variations (CNVs).
Library preparation was performed using KAPA HyperPrep/
HyperPlus Library Preparation Kit (Roche NimbleGen Inc).
An in-house SeqCap EZ Choice XL Probes (Roche Nim-
bleGen Inc) targeting the coding exons of genes associated
with

Interuniversity
Genomics High Throughput core (BRIGHTcore) (http://
www.brightcore.be/). The mean coverage of fetal samples
was between 250× and 300×, and the parental samples were
sequenced at 150×. Reads were aligned to the reference
genome (GRCh37/hg19) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner
(version 0.7.10), and variant calling was performed using
Genome Analysis Toolkit (version 3.3).

Variant ﬁltering
Variant ﬁltering and interpretation were carried out through
Highlander (https://sites.uclouvain.be/highlander/) accord-
ing to allele frequency and effect on protein and inheritance
pattern (de novo, homozygous and compound heterozygous,
X-linked [XL] inheritance in the case of male fetuses). fCES
data were analyzed by a laboratory scientist in collaboration
with prenatally involved clinical geneticists using the
collected clinical information about fetal phenotypes (as
described in the clinical data collection section). In partic-
ular, variant ﬁltering included several steps (Figure 1B).
First, a comprehensive in silico panel of genes (up to 1273
genes) involved in congenital anomalies (developed from
Pangalos et al13 and Fetal anomalies panel from Genomics
England PanelApp [https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.
uk/]) (Supplemental Table 5) was analyzed using a trio/
duo-based approach, exploring the different inheritance
patterns. Second, trio/duo analysis of the entire clinical
exome (up to 4867 genes) (Supplemental Table 4) was
accomplished for all inheritance modes. If the results of the
previous analyses were negative and the fetal anomalies
were speciﬁc for 1 system or were highly suggestive of
deﬁned genetic disorders, further in silico gene panels were
investigated exclusively in the proband (simplex analysis)
using Genomics England PanelApp, GeneReviews (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1116/),
HPO,
or
the
most recent literature. In selected cases (ie, only 1 likely
pathogenic/pathogenic variant detected in genes responsible
for recessive disorders), single exon CNVs were detected
using Copy Number Variation Detection In NGS gene
panels20 and exonic CNV data were visualized using in-
house software. This exonic CNV pipeline was run
retrospectively.
Variant interpretation
Variant interpretation and classiﬁcation followed interna-
tional guidelines (pathogenic: class V; likely pathogenic:
class IV; variant of unknown signiﬁcance (VUS): class III;
likely benign: class II; benign: class I).21 For class V, we
used stringent criteria because the analysis had to be per-
formed with phenotypic information that was limited to the
prenatal stages (ie, fetal ultrasound and, if available, nuclear
magnetic resonance imaging) and, for the majority of pro-
spective cases, absent/limited postnatal phenotypic charac-
terization; therefore, only the variants already reported in the
literature as pathogenic were classiﬁed as class V. None-
theless, highly suspicious novel variants (eg, loss-of-
function variant in a dosage-sensitive gene) within genes
related to the fetal phenotype were classiﬁed as likely
pathogenic (class IV) and reported. In addition, if further
information was needed for correct interpretation of the data
or if a potential discrepancy between the genetic ﬁndings
and the fetal phenotype was noted, candidate variants were
discussed in a multidisciplinary team.
Our ethical review board–approved informed consent
form did not mention the possibility of opting in/out of
reporting secondary variant information. Therefore, the
American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics rec-
ommendations for reporting of secondary ﬁndings22 were
not followed. In particular, fetal incidental ﬁndings were
reported only if highly penetrant pathogenic/likely patho-
genic variants were detected in genes known to cause
moderate or severe childhood-onset disorders. Pathogenic or
likely pathogenic variants in genes known to cause medi-
cally actionable dominant conditions (inherited cancer
syndromes,
cardiovascular,
and
others)
were
reported
exclusively in the parental reports if they had consented to
the return of these results.
Variant validation
Variants were conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing if they arose
as a de novo event in the index case or if the variant call-
speciﬁc metrics (eg, read depth, allele balance, strand bias)
and/or their genomic context (eg, presence of repeats,
pseudogenic regions) were considered suboptimal.
Statistical analysis
The number of diagnostic variants in the 2 cohorts was
compared using a χ2 test performed using GraphPad Prism
v.7.0 (GraphPad Software).
Results
A total of 300 couples were recruited, and 303 fetal samples
(120 terminated and 183 ongoing pregnancies) were pro-
cessed for fCES (Supplemental Tables 6 and 7). Fetal DNA
was obtained from amniocentesis (68.9%, 209/303), CVS
(14.1%, 43/303), fetal blood (6.6%, 20/303), or tissue
samples (10.2%, 31/303). Male to female ratios were 0.94
(89/94) and 1.2 (66/54) in the prospective and retrospective
cohorts, respectively. fCES was mostly performed in trio
(176 prospective and 116 retrospective cases), followed by
duo (7 prospective cases) or quartet (4 retrospective cases
belonging to 2 couples). In the prospective group preg-
nancy, outcomes were available for 105 of 183 fetuses
(57%). Of these, the parents opted for termination in 45
pregnancies (25%), 6 ended in miscarriages (3%), 2 ended
in neonatal deaths (1%), and 52 were livebirths (28%). In
contrast, in the retrospective cohort, the pregnancy outcome
was known in most cases (109/120, 91%). Ninety of them
were terminated (82.5%), 16 ended in miscarriages (15%),
and 3 ended in neonatal death (2.5%).
Among the prospective cases, warning signs were vari-
able. Some phenotypic categories represented a small sample
size (<10 cases), such as anomalies of the endocrine system
(0.5%,
1/183),
digestive
tract
(1.6%,
3/183),
genital
system (1.6%, 3/183), spine (1.6%, 3/183), face (2.2%,
4/183), ﬂuid regulation (2.2%, 4/183), musculature (2.7%,
5/183), and amniotic ﬂuid volume (3.3%, 6/183) (Figure 2B).

(7.7%, 14/183), skeleton (8.2%, 15/183), nervous system
(12%, 22/183), multiple organs (33.9%, 62/183), and NT
(10.9%, 20/183) represented larger cohorts (Figure 2B). In
contrast, most of the retrospective cases displayed multiple
(65.8%, 79/120) and cerebral abnormalities (11.7%, 14/120),
followed by fetuses with spinal (6.7%, 8/120), urinary (5.8%,
7/120), ﬂuid regulation (3.3%, 4/120), facial (3.3%, 4/120),
skeletal (1.7%, 2/120), cardiovascular (0.8%, 1/120), and
digestive (0.8%, 1/120) defects (Figure 3B).
In the prospective cohort, our multistep variant analysis
process provided a genetic diagnosis in 24 of 183 cases
(13%) (Figure 2A, Table 1). None of the 7 cases for which a
duo-based analysis was performed could be solved. Most
diagnostic variants (18/24, 75%) were found through anal-
ysis of the congenital anomalies gene panel (Figures 1B and
2A). Four additional cases (4/24, 16.7%) were solved
through analysis of the whole clinical exome (Figures 1B
and 2A). A speciﬁc in silico gene panel in simplex analysis

(ie, only ﬁltering on the proband variants) solved 2 more
cases (2/24, 8.3%) (Figure 2A). Among the positive cases,
only 1 presented a relevant family history (ie, affected fetus
from previous pregnancy). When only consanguineous
couples (n = 12) were taken into account, the diagnostic
yield increased to 42% (5/12). In the whole prospective
cohort, autosomal dominant (AD) disorders accounted for
46% (n = 11) of cases and all were caused by a de novo
variant (genes: PIK3CA, ZIC2, TSC2, NRAS, COL1A1,
CHAMP1, ARID1B, TP63, RASA1) (Table 1). Autosomal
recessive (AR) disorders were diagnosed in 11 cases (46%),
including 6 (54.5%) with compound heterozygous variants
and 5 (45.5%) with homozygous variants (genes: MKS1,
PKHD1, PKD1, SLC7A9, TPO, RBM8A, SLC17A5, COQ9,
BBS7) (Table 1). In this last subgroup, consanguinity was
noted in 4 of 5 cases, and a founder pathogenic variant was

present in the remaining case. One XL disorder was found
(1/24, 4.2%) (gene: IDS) (Table 1), and a digenic diagnosis
was proposed in 1 case (1/24, 4.2%). Interestingly, 2 cases
involved detection of a single nucleotide change along with
a CNV (genes: RBM8A and SLC17A5) (Table 1). The
highest diagnostic yields in the prospective cohort (among
subgroups with ≥10 cases) were obtained for skeletal (20%,
n = 3/15), multiple (19%, n = 12/62), urinary (18%, n =
2/11), and cerebral anomalies (14%, n = 3/22) (Figure 2B).
Three cases from our prospective series warranted further
description (see Supplemental Case Reports for details). The
discovery of a novel fetal phenotype caused by a novel
variant within a known gene is illustrated by case P131 for
which a de novo truncating variant of the CHAMP1 gene
(Supplemental Figure 2, Supplemental Case Reports),
associated with AD mental retardation (OMIM 616579),
was detected in a fetus presenting with increased NT and
congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Case P136, presenting
with hydrops fetalis, hyperechogenic kidneys, and hepato-
megaly, was solved by the detection of 1 pathogenic variant
in the SLC17A5 gene (Salla disease, OMIM 604369)––by a
simplex analysis of an in silico panel hydrops fetalis––along
with a SLC17A5 microduplication detected after the CNV
analysis through Copy Number Variation Detection In NGS
gene panels (Supplemental Figure 1, Supplemental Case
Reports), showing the need for multiple analysis strate-
gies. In numerous cases, medical teams are faced with
variant interpretation challenges, as in case P178 presenting
with
spina
biﬁda,
lemon
sign,
and
mild
fetal
ven-
triculomegaly for which compound heterozygous VUS were
detected in the SCRIB gene (Supplemental Figure 3,
Supplemental Case Reports), a candidate gene for neural
tube defects.
Most fetuses in the prospective cohort were classiﬁed
using 1 to 3 HPO terms (Figure 2C), with a median number
of 2 terms. Although the correlation between frequency of a
positive diagnosis and the number of HPO terms was not
statistically signiﬁcant, the trend of the plot may suggest that
fCES diagnostic yield could be partially determined by an
accurate phenotypic description (Figure 2D).
In the retrospective cohort, a diagnosis was reached in 35
of 120 cases (29%) through multistep analysis (Figure 3A,
Table 2). The diagnostic rate was thus signiﬁcantly higher in
the retrospective than in the prospective cohort (N = 303;
X2
(2) = 11.9; P < .001). Most variants (30/35, 86%) were
found using the gene panel for congenital anomalies
(Figures 1B and 3A), and the remaining cases required
analysis of all the fCES genes (5/35, 14%) (Figure 3A).
Among the solved cases, 5 were characterized by a positive
family history (5/35, 14%). When only consanguineous
couples were considered (n = 15), the diagnostic rate
increased to 40% (6/15). AD disorders were diagnosed in
49% (17/35) with mostly de novo variants (15/35, 43%)
(genes: ACTA1, MYH3, HRAS, PTPN11, DVL1, FLNB,
RIT1, BRAF, JAG1, KMT2D, COL1A1, GREB1L) (Table 2).
Parental mosaicism was identiﬁed in 2 of the cases affected
by AD syndromes (genes: COL1A1, GREB1L) (Table 2).
Similar to AD disorders, AR diseases were diagnosed in 17
cases (17/35, 49%) with compound heterozygous (9/35,
26%) and homozygous variants (8/35, 23%) (genes: NEB,
ASCC1,
ASPM,
GBE1,
B3GALNT2,
ISPD,
CEP290,
PIEZO1,
TUBGCP6,
TNNT3,
DDX11,
ALG3,
ETFA)
(Table 2). In 5 of 8 fetuses (63%) presenting with homo-
zygous variants, the parents were consanguineous, whereas
in most other cases the variants were hotspot variants.
Moreover, an XL disorder was diagnosed (1/35, 3%) (gene:
IDS) (Table 2). The greatest proportion of diagnostic genetic
variants (subgroups with ≥10 cases) were found in fetuses
presenting with multiple (34%, n = 27/79) and cerebral
(28.5%, n = 4/14) anomalies (Figure 3B).
The average number of HPO terms used was 5, and most
of the cases were described using 3 or 4 terms (Figure 3C).
As seen in the prospective cohort, there is a trend suggesting
that a detailed fetal phenotype characterization enhances the
likelihood of a diagnosis (Figure 3D).
VUS that may have contributed to the fetal phenotype
were reported in 7% of prospective (12/183) and retro-
spective (8/120) cases (Figures 2A and 3A, Supplemental
Table 8). The analysis of the gene panel for congenital
anomalies (Figure 1B) allowed VUS identiﬁcation in 4 of 12
prospective and 3 of 8 retrospective cases. In 5 of 12 pro-
spective and 5 of 8 retrospective cases, VUS were detected
after analysis of all fCES genes. In the prospective cohort,
additional simplex gene panel analyses identiﬁed the 3
remaining VUS.
Fetal incidental ﬁndings were reported in 2 prospective
cases (Supplemental Table 9), and 2 of the 3 variants re-
ported were found after the analysis of all the fCES gene
content. Parental incidental ﬁndings were reported in 5 cases
(1 retrospective and 4 prospective cases), and they were
mostly detected through whole clinical exome analysis
(Supplemental Table 10).
The average TAT, deﬁned as the number of days be-
tween the request for fCES and the ﬁnal report validation by
a clinical geneticist, was calculated for both cohorts. The
average TAT was 4 and 2.5 months for the retrospective and
prospective cohorts, respectively. For the latter, TAT
improved to 29 working days (range 17-43 working days)
during the course of our study.
Discussion
The use of fCES in fetuses presenting with anomalies
detected using ultrasound allowed the identiﬁcation of the
underlying genetic cause in 13% prospective and 29%
retrospective cases by using a multistep variant analysis.
One factor that could explain the difference might be the
case recruitment procedure because interrupted pregnancies
more often displayed a severe multisystem phenotype and
were selected by clinical geneticists. In addition, detailed
phenotypic information was available, offering valuable
support for variant interpretation. Consequently, the diag-
nostic rate of the retrospective cohort was similar to that of
M. Marangoni et al.

the postnatal series.10,15 Conversely, the prospective cohort
included unselected cases, notably some with fetal anoma-
lies
weakly
associated
with
monogenic
ﬁndings
(ie,
increased NT or neural tube defects). Furthermore, variant
interpretation was hampered by the limited knowledge of in
utero phenotypes. Results from the unselected cohort are
comparable with the ones described in other ES prospective
studies in which diagnostic variants were detected in 8.5%
to 10.3% of cases.16,17 Our slightly higher diagnostic yield
may be explained by a greater proportion of consanguineous
couples (12/171, 7%).
The highest diagnostic rates were achieved for fetuses
presenting with multisystem and cerebral anomalies in the
retrospective
cohort.
In
the
multisystem
subgroup,
a
conclusive molecular diagnosis was reached for most cases
with a fetal akinesia sequence (9/11, 82%) or a Meckel-
Gruber–related phenotype (5/6, 83%), indicating that fCES
is highly recommended for these ultrasound ﬁndings. In the
prospective cohort, diagnostic rates were highest in fetuses
with multiple systems, skeletal, urinary, and cerebral
anomalies. These results are in agreement with previous
studies,16,17 although higher rates for fetuses with cardiac16
and lymphatic17 anomalies were also described. Because the
proportion of cases belonging to these phenotypic categories
was small in our cohort, further studies are required to draw
ﬁnal conclusions. Similarly, the absence of diagnostic var-
iants in rarely explored phenotypic categories (ie, isolated
intrauterine growth restriction and anomalies of the amniotic
ﬂuid) needs to be further investigated in larger series. In line
with other studies, no NGS diagnostic variants were found
in fetuses with either neural tube defects or isolated
increased NT.16,23 More data, more exploratory variant se-
lection, and more complex heritability investigations (eg,
oligogenic, noncoding, polygenic) will be necessary to
assess the diagnostic yield of NGS in these anomalies.
Interestingly, our study shows that the proportion of AD
and AR diagnoses was the same, which is in contrast with
reports related to postnatal series in which de novo variants
accounted for most of the cases.24 Remarkably, our study
shows the importance of investigating compound heterozy-
gous variants (especially in nonconsanguineous cases) because
they represent 54.5% and 26% of positive AR diagnoses in
our 2 cohorts. This result may be explained by the fact that AR
diseases are more often responsible for the interruption of
pregnancy or perinatal lethality. Other fetal series observed
similar proportions,12,16,17,25 suggesting that AR disorders play
an important role in severe fetal phenotypes.
On the basis of the experience accumulated in this and
other studies,11,26,27 it seems beneﬁcial to perform a trio/duo-
based analysis involving all the genes of the clinical exome.
Such an analysis strategy carries a diagnostic gain of 16.7%
(prospective cases) and 14% (retrospective cohort) when
compared with a trio/duo analysis focused on a comprehen-
sive congenital anomalies gene panel designed using litera-
ture (Figures 2A and 3A). In complement to this strategy, we
found that, when appropriate, a simplex analysis of in silico
panels comprising genes speciﬁc for the fetal phenotype with
adapted variant selection criteria also increased the diagnostic
yield (8.3% in the prospective cohort) (Figure 2A).
In addition to expanding our understanding of fetal pre-
sentations for known genetic conditions (as in case P6,
described in28) and identifying new types of pathogenic
variants in association with them (as in case P32, reported
in29), phenotypes resembling conditions not previously re-
ported prenatally may be identiﬁed, leading to challenges in
data interpretation and assessment of the variants’ patho-
genicity (represented here by case P131). Additional chal-
lenges arise with recessive pathologies for which only 1
pathogenic variant is detected, such as in prospective case
P136. Finally, further analysis of speciﬁc gene panels using
simplex analysis allowed the detection of inherited patho-
genic variants responsible for AD disorders with incomplete
penetrance or the discovery of 1 diagnostic variant in genes
responsible for AR disorders consistent with the fetal
phenotype, which would otherwise have been missed if only
trio-based analysis was performed (P136).
In most of the reported VUS, the variants were heterozy-
gous in an asymptomatic parent, and further clinical exami-
nations and segregation analysis were recommended to assess
pathogenicity. Incomplete penetrance and variable expression
among family members (eg, variants within the COL4A2
gene and risk of porencephaly) complicate evaluation, and
these variants often remain of unknown signiﬁcance until
similar cases with the same variant are identiﬁed in inde-
pendent families. VUS may also contribute to some pheno-
typic features that a diagnostic variant could not explain (as
found in case P158) (Table 1). Although smaller, focused
gene panels limit the incidental identiﬁcation of VUS16 and
true diagnoses may also be missed,25 making the selection of
the most appropriate analysis method challenging.
As fCES/ES become more widely implemented, it is
crucial to share phenotypic and molecular data in interna-
tional databases to improve variant interpretation and
recognition of novel fetal genotype–phenotype correlations.
The absence of a statistically signiﬁcant correlation between
the number of HPO terms and the percentage of conclusive
diagnoses may be explained by multiple factors, such as the
reduced number of cases presenting with a high number of
HPO terms, the presence of cases with multiple anomalies
with a low-level association with monogenic diseases, and/
or the fact that some genetic anomalies or variants in genes
not studied in our design are not detected. Further analyses
on larger series will be needed to draw ﬁnal conclusions on
the importance of the HPO terminology usage. Nonetheless,
we highly recommend that clinicians requesting fetal NGS
provide detailed clinical information and family history to
genetics laboratories.18 Moreover, in the context of inter-
rupted pregnancies, the complementary information identi-
ﬁed by postmortem examination strongly contributes to a
higher diagnostic yield. Of note, we encountered difﬁculties
in describing some fetal phenotypes because HPO terms
were missing for a portion of prenatal anomalies detected
using ultrasound (eg, antenatal hyperechoic colon) or sub-
types of anomalies. We thus believe that efforts should be
360

made to expand the existing fetal HPO terminology. Simi-
larly, we found that variant classiﬁcation could be particu-
larly challenging in a prenatal setting because classical
criteria21 were not always applicable given the inevitably
limited phenotypic characterization in utero.
Our study has limitations regarding the diagnosis of some
phenotypic categories that will require further clinical
evaluations. Another limitation of our study is that exonic
CNVs were not routinely investigated and were only
analyzed when 1 diagnostic variant was already found in a
gene causing an AR phenotype. In contrast to other studies,
ES was not performed. Although our approach limits the
discovery of new disease-causing genes and the data rean-
alysis power, it is suitable for a prenatal clinical setting,
allowing very high-quality coverage data in well-known
genes causing Mendelian disorders with prenatal onset. In
addition,
clinical
exome
sequencing
(CES)/ES-based
methods are limited to the detection of coding variants and
misses some genetic defects (eg, deep intronic variants,
nucleotide repeat expansions). This limitation can be over-
come by genome sequencing (GS). However, because of the
greater cost of GS over CES/ES-based methods, it is likely
that combined CMA and CES/ES-based analysis will
become more widely implemented before the advent of GS
in the
prenatal
clinical
setting.
The reﬁned prenatal
phenotype–genotype correlations expected to be obtained
from CES/ES-based methods will likely facilitate the sub-
sequent implementation of fetal GS.
In conclusion, this study showed that the overall diag-
nostic yields of CES using a multistep variant analysis were
13% and 29% in prospective and retrospective cases,
respectively. In particular, trio/duo-based analysis involving
all the genes of the clinical exome and simplex analysis (ie,
in silico panels on fCES data comprising genes speciﬁc for
the fetal phenotype) were complementary to achieve the
highest diagnostic rate possible, and compound heterozy-
gous genotypes were not rare. fCES-based diagnosis was
efﬁcient in fetuses presenting with cerebral, skeletal, uri-
nary, or multiple anomalies. The comparison between a
retrospective and a prospective cohort highlighted the
importance of providing detailed phenotypic information to
genetic laboratories performing fetal NGS for better inter-
pretation and reporting of genetic variants. Finally, selected
cases illustrate some interpretation challenges faced during
the analysis of genome-wide data and widen the knowledge
of the prenatal presentation of genetic syndromes.
Data Availability
Clinical and genetic data of 198 of 303 patients are
described in detail in Supplemental Tables 6 and 7). For the
remaining 105 of 303 cases for whom no formal informed
consent for the sharing of personal data was provided, only
limited information was included in the general statistics (ie,
only their phenotypic categories and the presence/absence of
diagnostic variant(s)/variants of uncertain signiﬁcance were
shared). Further details about our methods are available
upon request.
