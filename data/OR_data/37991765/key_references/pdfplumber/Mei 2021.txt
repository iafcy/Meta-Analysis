Abstract
Background Infantile hydrocephalus (IHC) is commonly related to other central nervous system diseases, which may have
adverse effects on prognosis. The causes of IHC are heterogeneous, and the genetic etiologies are not fully understood. This
study aimed to analyze the genetic etiologies of an IHC cohort.
Methods The data for 110 IHC patients who had received exome sequencing at the Clinical Genetic Center of the Children’s
Hospital of Fudan University between 2016 and 2019 were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively. An exome-wide associa-
tion analysis (EWAS) was performed within this cohort using IHC as the study phenotype.
Results Of the 110 IHC patients, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was identified in 16 (15%) patients, spanning
13 genes. The genes were mainly associated with metabolic disorders, brain abnormalities, and genetic syndromes. IHC
patients who had unclear clinical etiology were more likely to possess a genetic etiology. Based on previous studies and
on our EWAS results, ZEB1, SBF2, and GNAI2 were over-represented among IHC patients and might affect the signaling
pathways involved in IHC formation.
Conclusions Our study showed heterogeneous genetic etiologies in an IHC cohort. It is essential to perform genetic testing
on IHC patients who have unclear clinical etiology, and genes associated with metabolic disorders, brain abnormalities, and
genetic syndromes should be noted. In addition, when aiming to discover IHC susceptibility genes, genes that might influ-
ence the signaling pathways involved in IHC formation should be prioritized.
