            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      As microarray technology has become mature and popular, the selection and use of a small number of relevant genes for accurate classification of samples has arisen as a hot topic in the circles of biostatistics and bioinformatics. However, most of the developed algorithms lack the ability to handle multiple classes, arguably a common application. Here, we propose an extension to an existing regularization algorithm, called Threshold Gradient Descent Regularization (TGDR), to specifically tackle multi-class classification of microarray data. When there are several microarray experiments addressing the same/similar objectives, one option is to use a meta-analysis version of TGDR (Meta-TGDR), which considers the classification task as a combination of classifiers with the same structure/model while allowing the parameters to vary across studies. However, the original Meta-TGDR extension did not offer a solution to the prediction on independent samples. Here, we propose an explicit method to estimate the overall coefficients of the biomarkers selected by Meta-TGDR. This extension permits broader applicability and allows a comparison between the predictive performance of Meta-TGDR and TGDR using an independent testing set.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Using real-world applications, we demonstrated the proposed multi-TGDR framework works well and the number of selected genes is less than the sum of all individualized binary TGDRs. Additionally, Meta-TGDR and TGDR on the batch-effect adjusted pooled data approximately provided same results. By adding Bagging procedure in each application, the stability and good predictive performance are warranted.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Compared with Meta-TGDR, TGDR is less computing time intensive, and requires no samples of all classes in each study. On the adjusted data, it has approximate same predictive performance with Meta-TGDR. Thus, it is highly recommended."

            "abstract": "Optical fibre bundles usually comprise a few thousand to tens of thousands of individually clad glass optical fibres. The ordered arrangement of the fibres enables coherent transmission of an image through the bundle and therefore enables analysis and viewing in remote locations. In fused bundles, this architecture has also been used to fabricate arrays of various micro to nano-scale surface structures (micro/nanowells, nanotips, triangles, etc.) over relatively large areas. These surface structures have been used to obtain new optical and analytical capabilities. Indeed, the imaging bundle can be thought of as a \"starting material\" that can be sculpted by a combination of fibre drawing and selective wet-chemical etching processes. A large variety of bioanalytical applications have thus been developed, ranging from nano-optics to DNA nanoarrays. For instance, nanostructured optical surfaces with intrinsic light-guiding properties have been exploited as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) platforms and as near-field probe arrays. They have also been productively associated with electrochemistry to fabricate arrays of transparent nanoelectrodes with electrochemiluminescent imaging properties. The confined geometry of the wells has been loaded with biosensing materials and used as femtolitre-sized vessels to detect single molecules. This review describes the fabrication of high-density nanostructured optical fibre arrays and summarizes the large range of optical and bioanalytical applications that have been developed, reflecting the versatility of this ordered light-guiding platform."

Microfluidic assay techniques have brought widespread advances in C. elegans research; however, traditional microfluidic assays such as those based on soft lithography require time-consuming design and fabrication cycles and offer limited flexibility in changing the geometric environment during experimentation. We present a technique for maskless photopatterning of a biocompatible hydrogel on an NGM (Agar) substrate, enabling dynamic manipulation of the C. elegans culture environment in vitro. Maskless photopatterning is performed using a projector-based microscope system largely built from off-the-shelf components. We demonstrate the capabilities of this technique by building micropillar arrays during C. elegans observation, by fabricating free-floating mechanisms that can be actuated by C. elegans motion, by using freehand drawing to isolate individual C. elegans in real time, and by patterning arrays of mazes for isolation and fitness testing of C. elegans populations. In vitro photopatterning enables rapid and flexible design of experiment geometry as well as real-time interaction between the researcher and the assay such as by sequential isolation of individual organisms. Future adoption of image analysis and machine learning techniques could be used to acquire large datasets and automatically adapt the assay geometry."

            "abstract": "Food intolerance is delayed adverse food reactions which follow consumption of specific foods. The underlying mechanisms are not well understood, but food intolerance is often considered as a type 2 hypersensitivity reaction mediated by immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody. To understand the causes of food intolerance, it is important to investigate sensitization patterns of food-specific IgGs (sIgG) in relation to dietary patterns and physical conditions. Conventional approaches to measure serological IgGs often require large volumes of serum, thus are not suitable for highly multiplexed assays. To overcome this impracticality, we developed a highly sensitive method to screen the sIgGs and other antibody isotypes against 66 antigens with minimal amount of serums. We prepared a microarray by immobilizing food antigens on activated glass slides. Human sera and their dietary information were obtained from 30 subjects. Aliquots (200 nl) of sera were analyzed against 66 food antigens in parallel. sIgG levels were determined and analyzed in relation to subjects' dietary patterns. The levels of antibody isotypes were also examined to understand the relationship between allergy and food intolerance. The developed microarray showed exceptional performances in antibody screening and demonstrated the potential to be used as an automated assay system."

Lab-on-a-stick tests are ideally suited to analysis of particulate samples such as mammalian or bacterial cells, and capable of performing multiple different parallel microfluidic assays when dipped into a single sample with results recorded optically. The utility of this new diagnostics format was demonstrated by performing three types of multiplex cellular assays that are challenging to perform in conventional dipsticks: 1) instantaneous ABO blood typing; 2) microbial identification; and 3) antibiotic minimum inhibitory (MIC) concentration measurement. A pressure balance model closely predicted the superficial flow velocities in individual capillaries, that were overestimated by up to one order of magnitude by the Lucas-Washburn equation conventionally used for wicking in cylindrical pores. Lab-on-a-stick provides a cost-effective, simple, portable and flexible multiplex platform for a range of assays, and will deliver a new generation of advanced yet affordable point-of-care tests for global diagnostics."

By controlling chamber height to droplet diameter ratios we predictively control three-dimensional packing configurations with varying degrees of droplet overlap to increase droplet density and imaging sensor area coverage efficiency. Fluorescence imaging of the densely packed 3D reactor arrays, up to three layers high, demonstrates high throughput quantitative analysis of single-molecule reactions. Now a greater number of microreactors can be observed and studied in a single picture frame without the need for confocal imaging, slide scanners, or complicated image processing techniques. Compared to 2D designs, tunable 3D reactor arrays yield up to a threefold increase in density and use 100% of the sensor's imaging area to enable simultaneous imaging a larger number of reactions without sacrificing digital quantification performance. This novel approach provides an important advancement for ultra-high-density reactor arrays."

This chapter proposes a multiagent algorithm for building a distributed algorithm for DNA Microarray management. A collection of agents, in which each one representing a Microarray (or chip), execute in parallel a sequence of simple operations exploiting local information, and an organized virtual structure is built at global level. A word embeddings approach, able to capture the semantic context and represent Microarrays with vectors, is employed to map the chips, so allowing advanced agents' operations. A similarity-based overlay network of agents is brought out and an efficient management system of DNA Microarray is enabled.

Yet, for some microarray datasets, both classification accuracy and stability of gene sets obtained still have rooms for improvement. This may be due to the presence of samples with wrong class labels (i.e. outliers). Outlier detection algorithms proposed so far are either not suitable for microarray data, or only solve the outlier detection problem on their own.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We tackle the outlier detection problem based on a previously proposed Multiple-Filter-Multiple-Wrapper (MFMW) model, which was demonstrated to yield promising results when compared to other hybrid approaches (Leung and Hung, 2010). To incorporate outlier detection and overcome limitations of the existing MFMW model, three new features are introduced in our proposed MFMW-outlier approach: 1) an unbiased external Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation framework is developed to replace internal cross-validation in the previous MFMW model; 2) wrongly labeled samples are identified within the MFMW-outlier model; and 3) a stable set of genes is selected using an L1-norm SVM that removes any redundant genes present. Six binary-class microarray datasets were tested. Comparing with outlier detection studies on the same datasets, MFMW-outlier could detect all the outliers found in the original paper (for which the data was provided for analysis), and the genes selected after outlier removal were proven to have biological relevance. We also compared MFMW-outlier with PRAPIV (Zhang et al., 2006) based on same synthetic datasets. MFMW-outlier gave better average precision and recall values on three different settings. Lastly, artificially flipped microarray datasets were created by removing our detected outliers and flipping some of the remaining samples' labels. Almost all the 'wrong' (artificially flipped) samples were detected, suggesting that MFMW-outlier was sufficiently powerful to detect outliers in high-dimensional microarray datasets."

The results showed that microarray probed with the single mannose structure is not enough for the detection of bacteria with various serovars or subtypes, which contain a high degree of allelic variation in adhesin.

We performed CNV detection by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or low pass CNV-sequencing (CNV-seq), and in parallel SNVs/indels detection by trio-based clinical exome sequencing (CES) or whole exome sequencing (WES). Eight-three singleton pregnancies with a normal fetal karyotype were enrolled in this prospective observational study. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variations were identified in 30 cases (CNVs in 3 cases, SNVs/indels in 27 cases), indicating an overall molecular diagnostic rate of 36.1% (30/83). Two cases had both a CNV of uncertain significance (VOUS) and likely pathogenic SNV, and one case carried both a VOUS CNV and an SNV. We demonstrated that simultaneous analysis of CNVs and SNVs/indels can improve the diagnostic yield of prenatal diagnosis with shortened reporting time, namely, 2-3 weeks. Due to the relatively long TAT for sequential procedure for prenatal genetic diagnosis, as well as recent sequencing technology advancements, it is clinically necessary to consider the simultaneous evaluation of CNVs and SNVs/indels to enhance the diagnostic yield and timely TAT, especially for cases in the late second trimester or third trimester."

            "abstract": "Diagnosis of rare copy number variants (CNVs) with scarce literature evidence poses a major challenge for interpretation of the clinical significance of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) results, especially in the prenatal setting. Bioinformatic tools can be used to assist in this issue; however, this prediction can be imprecise. Our objective was to describe the phenotype of the rare copy number losses encompassing the 8q24.13-q24.3 locus, and to find common features in terms of genomic coordinates, gene content, and clinical phenotypic characteristics. Appropriate cases were retrieved using local databases of two largest Israeli centers performing CMA analysis. In addition, literature and public databases search was performed. Local database search yielded seven new patients with del (8)(q24.13q24.3) (one of these with an additional copy number variant). Literature and public databases search yielded eight additional patients. The cases showed high phenotypic variability, ranging from asymptomatic adults and fetuses with normal ultrasound to patients with autism/developmental delay (6/11 postnatal cases, 54.5%). No clear association was noted between the specific disease-causing/high-pLI gene content of the described del (8)(q24.13q24.3) to neurodevelopmental disorders, except for a possibly relevant locus encompassing the KCNQ3 gene. We present the challenges in classification of rare variants with limited clinical information. In such cases, genotype-phenotype correlation must be assessed with extra-caution and possibly using additional methods to assist the classification, especially in the prenatal setting."

            "abstract": "With advances in molecular biology, microarray data have become an important resource in the exploration of complex human diseases. Although gene chip technology continues to grow, there are still many barriers to overcome, such as high costs, small sample sizes, complex procedures, poor repeatability, and the dependence on data analysis methods. To avoid these problems, simulation data have a vital role in the study of complex diseases. A simulation method of microarray data is introduced in this study to model the occurrence and development of general diseases. Using classic statistics and control theory, five risk models are proposed. One or more models can be introduced into the baseline simulation dataset with a case-control label. In addition, time-series gene expression data can be generated to model the dynamic evolutionary process of a disease. The prevalence of each model is estimated and disease-associated genes are tested by significance analysis of microarrays.

            "abstract": "In 1959, 63 years after the death of John Langdon Down, Jérôme Lejeune discovered trisomy 21 as the genetic reason for Down syndrome. Screening for Down syndrome has been applied since the 1960s by using maternal age as the risk parameter. Since then, several advances have been made. First trimester screening, combining maternal age, maternal serum parameters and ultrasound findings, emerged in the 1990s with a detection rate (DR) of around 90-95% and a false positive rate (FPR) of around 5%, also looking for trisomy 13 and 18. With the development of high-resolution ultrasound, around 50% of fetal anomalies are now detected in the first trimester. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for trisomy 21, 13 and 18 is a highly efficient screening method and has been applied as a first-line or a contingent screening approach all over the world since 2012, in some countries without a systematic screening program. Concomitant with the rise in technology, the possibility of screening for other genetic conditions by analysis of cfDNA, such as sex chromosome anomalies (SCAs), rare autosomal anomalies (RATs) and microdeletions and duplications, is offered by different providers to an often not preselected population of pregnant women. Most of the research in the field is done by commercial providers, and some of the tests are on the market without validated data on test performance. This raises difficulties in the counseling process and makes it nearly impossible to obtain informed consent. In parallel with the advent of new screening technologies, an expansion of diagnostic methods has begun to be applied after invasive procedures. The karyotype has been the gold standard for decades. Chromosomal microarrays (CMAs) able to detect deletions and duplications on a submicroscopic level have replaced the conventional karyotyping in many countries. Sequencing methods such as whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) tremendously amplify the diagnostic yield in fetuses with ultrasound anomalies."

Here, we analyze a glycan array by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to gain a better understanding of the physicochemical properties of the individual spots and to improve carbohydrate microarray quality. The carbohydrate microarray is prepared by piezo printing of thiol-terminated sugars onto a maleimide functionalized glass slide. The hyperspectral ToF-SIMS imaging data are analyzed by multivariate curve resolution (MCR) to discern secondary ions from regions of the array containing saccharide, linker, salts from the printing buffer, and the background linker chemistry. Analysis of secondary ions from the linker common to all of the sugar molecules employed reveals a relatively uniform distribution of the sugars within the spots formed from solutions with saccharide concentration of 0.4 mM and less, whereas a doughnut shape is often formed at higher-concentration solutions. A detailed analysis of individual spots reveals that in the larger spots the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) salts are heterogeneously distributed, apparently resulting in saccharide concentrated at the rim of the spots. A model of spot formation from the evaporating sessile drop is proposed to explain these observations. Saccharide spot diameters increase with saccharide concentration due to a reduction in surface tension of the saccharide solution compared to PBS. The multivariate analytical partial least squares (PLS) technique identifies ions from the sugars that in the complex ToF-SIMS spectra correlate with the binding of galectin proteins."

Despite the benefits that microfluidic systems provide, they typically operate in the laminar flow regime under mass transfer limitations, where large analyte depletion layers act as a resistance to analyte capture. By locally stirring the fluid and delivering fresh analyte to the capture spot, the use of passive mixing structures in a microarray environment can reduce the negative effects of these depletion layers and enhance the sensor performance. Despite their large potential, little attention has been given to the integration of these mixing structures in microarray sensing environments. In this study, we use passive mixing structures to enhance the mass transfer of analyte to a capture spot within a microfluidic flow cell. Using numerical methods, different structure shapes and heights were evaluated as means to increase local fluid velocities, and in turn, rates of mass transfer to a capture spot. These results were verified experimentally via the real-time detection of 20-mer ssDNA for an array of microspots. Both numerical and experimental results showed that a passive mixing structure situated directly over the capture spot can significantly enhance the binding rate of analyte to the sensing surface. Moreover, we show that these structures can be used to enhance mass transfer in experiments regarding an array of capture spots. The results of this study can be applied to any experimental system using microfluidic sample delivery methods for microarray detection techniques."

In the untreated wastewater, the average shares of kanamycin-, streptomycin-, and tetracycline-resistant bacteria were 53, 56, and 42%, respectively. Meanwhile, the shares of kanamycin-, streptomycin-, and tetracycline-resistant bacteria in the treated wastewater were 39, 33, and 29%, respectively. To evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility of the bacteria present in the wastewater, using the phenotype microarrays (PMs), the most common isolates from the treated wastewater were chosen: Serratia marcescens ss marcescens, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Stenotrophomonas rhizophila, Microbacterium flavescens, Alcaligenes faecalis ss faecalis, Flavobacterium hydatis, Variovorax paradoxus, Acinetobacter johnsonii, and Aeromonas bestiarum. The strains were classified as multi-antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Most of them were resistant to more than 30 antibiotics from various chemical classes. Phenotype microarrays could be successfully used as an additional tool for evaluation of the multi-antibiotic resistance of environmental bacteria and in preliminary determination of the range of inhibition concentration."

Since the missing data points can hinder downstream analyses, there exists a wide variety of ways in which to deal with missing values in large-scale data sets. Nowadays, it has become routine to estimate (or impute) the missing values prior to the actual data analysis. After nearly a decade since the publication of the first missing value imputation methods for gene expression microarray data, new imputation approaches are still being developed at an increasing rate. However, what is lagging behind is a systematic and objective evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches when faced with different types of data sets and experimental questions. In this review, the present strategies for missing value imputation and the measures for evaluating their performance are described. The imputation methods are first reviewed in the context of gene expression microarray data, since most of the methods have been developed for estimating gene expression levels; then, we turn to other large-scale data sets that also suffer from the problems posed by missing values, together with pointers to possible imputation approaches in these settings. Along with a description of the basic principles behind the different imputation approaches, the review tries to provide practical guidance for the users of high-throughput technologies on how to choose the imputation tool for their data and questions, and some additional research directions for the developers of imputation methodologies."

            "abstract": "Microarray batch effect (BE) has been the primary bottleneck for large-scale integration of data from multiple experiments. Current BE correction methods either need known batch identities (ComBat) or have the potential to overcorrect, by removing true but unknown biological differences (Surrogate Variable Analysis SVA). It is well known that experimental conditions such as array or reagent batches, PCR amplification or ozone levels can affect the measured expression levels; often the direction of perturbation of the measured expression is the same in different datasets. However, there are no BE correction algorithms that attempt to estimate the individual effects of technical differences and use them to correct expression data. In this manuscript, we show that a set of signatures, each of which is a vector the length of the number of probes, calculated on a reference set of microarray samples can predict much of the batch effect in other validation sets. We present a rationale of selecting a reference set of samples designed to estimate technical differences without removing biological differences. Putting both together, we introduce the Batch Effect Signature Correction (BESC) algorithm that uses the BES calculated on the reference set to efficiently predict and remove BE. Using two independent validation sets, we show that BESC is capable of removing batch effect without removing unknown but true biological differences. Much of the variations due to batch effect is shared between different microarray datasets. That shared information can be used to predict signatures (i.e. directions of perturbation) due to batch effect in new datasets. The correction can be precomputed without using the samples to be corrected (blind), done on each sample individually (single sample) and corrects only known technical effects without removing known or unknown biological differences (conservative). Those three characteristics make it ideal for high-throughput correction of samples for a microarray data repository. We also compare the performance of BESC to three other batch correction methods: SVA, Removing Unwanted Variation (RUV) and Hidden Covariates with Prior (HCP). An R Package besc implementing the algorithm is available from http://explainbio.com."

However, the incidence of HT-VUS was not statistically different between different groups.Conclusions: HT-VUS (deletions or duplications) involving introns and HT-VUS (duplications) including terminal coding exons (either the first or last exons) might be clinically neutral. Our study will be helpful for both interpretation and genetic counselling in the future."

We describe a simple approach that greatly facilitates these tasks for Drosophila melanogaster embryos, one of the most advanced models of developmental genetics. Based on passive hydrodynamics, we developed a microfluidic embryo-trap array that can be used to rapidly order and vertically orient hundreds of embryos. We describe the physical principles of the design and used this platform to quantitatively analyze multiple morphogen gradients in the dorsoventral patterning system. Our approach can also be used for live imaging and, with slight modifications, could be adapted for studies of pattern formation and morphogenesis in other model organisms."

A major requirement determining their uptake and use is the availability and stability of purified, functional proteins for immobilisation. With conventional methods, involving individual expression and purification of recombinant proteins, the cost of commercial high-content protein arrays is often found to be prohibitively high. Moreover, due to the need for specialised microarray production equipment, custom-made protein arrays containing more focussed sets of proteins of interest are also in little use. In the DNA array to protein array technology described herein, repeated economical printing of protein microarrays from a reusable template DNA microarray is performed on demand by cell-free -protein synthesis. Once the template DNA microarray has been obtained, protein microarrays are made using purely macro-handling procedures, making protein arraying accessible without sophisticated microarraying apparatus."

The wild type and vaccine strains of canine distemper virus (CDV), influenza virus, canine herpesvirus (CHV), Bordetella bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma cynos were detected and differentiated simultaneously on a microarray chip.

To analyze the surface antigen expression pattern in a high-throughput manner, antibody microarrays have been developed by several groups, including ours. This analysis can be performed using cell-binding assays on microarrays; moreover, this approach has advantages over conventional flow cytometry (FCM). Unlike FCM, the microarray-based method cannot evaluate the concurrent expression of more than two surface antigens on a single cell, and therefore, it cannot be used for cell subset analysis. To overcome this drawback, we prepared an antibody microarray with spots presenting co-immobilized multiple antibodies together with spots presenting each antibody separately. The co-immobilized spots are expected to be reactive for every surface antigen specific to the co-immobilized antibodies. In addition, the concept of an algebra of sets is incorporated into the derivation of quantitative data regarding cell subsets. Here, taking cell subsets with respect to two surface antigens as the simplest example, antibody microarrays were prepared and initially subjected to validation studies to verify the accuracy of cell-binding assays. Quantitative subset analysis was performed using antibody microarrays prepared using the anti-CD13 and anti-CD49f antibodies. For model populations that consisted of discrete subsets, THP-1, HL-60, CCRF-CEM, and Ramos cell lines were used because they were found by FCM to have a singular phenotype, that is, CD13+CD49f+, CD13+CD49f-, CD13-CD49f+, and CD13-CD49f-, respectively. Five populations were prepared by mixing these cells at various ratios and analyzed for their subsets using microarrays. The results showed that the experimentally determined abundance ratios of the four model subsets were in good agreement with the predetermined abundance ratios, which provided the proof of principle for the new method in the quantitative subset analysis."

The development of a microarray assay entails most of the cost, to be deferred by the massive use of the end product. A microarray assay development project, involving multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), labeling, hybridization and scanning/scoring steps is presented as a paradigm of objective bug ratios expected to such procedures and of ways to cope with them. Qualification of the microarray genotypes needs a reference method, which may still be restriction digestion or other, as sequencing remains an expensive commodity. Optimization of wet steps should also be followed by careful and perhaps individualized dye excitation and in silico scoring rules, taking into consideration decay and bleaching effects that perplex development. The strategy of successive elimination of problems, a top-bottom procedure, which had been used and is usually preferred by developing agencies, might have been erroneous; a bottom-up course to delineate issues in different levels, although more laborious, might be the correct choice, especially as software and robotic hardware, high throughput tools become more mature and available. The testing for interlocus compatibility, specificity and robustness is demanding and warranted only in the case of steady, high volume use of an assay for territorial, national or international use."

To address this knowledge gap, we applied WES to a population-based sample of 182 Bedouin and Jewish children with ASD from southern Israel, and assessed its yield in a gene panel of 205 genes robustly associated with ASD. We then compared the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for an ASD diagnosis by WES, chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), and CMA + WES. Overall, 32 ASD candidate variants were detected in 28 children, corresponding to an overall WES diagnostic yield of 15.4%. Interestingly, the diagnostic yield was significantly higher for the Bedouin children than for the Jewish children, i.e., 27.6% vs. 11.1% (p = 0.036). The most cost-effective means for genetic testing was the CMA alone, followed closely by the CMA + WES strategy (ICER = USD 117 and USD 124.8 per child). Yet, WES alone could become more cost effective than the other two approaches if there was to be a 25% increase in its yield or a 50% decrease in its cost.

            "abstract": "Ventriculomegaly discovered on prenatal ultrasound examinations is frequently a significant challenge both for the accurate identification of the etiology of ventriculomegaly as well as for adequate parental counseling. Fetal ventriculomegaly is usually easily depicted on prenatal ultrasound studies. It is, however, of utmost importance to differentiate between the various forms of ventriculomegaly. A ventriculomegaly may be \"isolated\" or part of a syndrome. In addition, ventriculomegaly may be a complication of an intrauterine infection or hemorrhage. A correct differentiation between the various etiologies of ventriculomegaly is essential to predict outcome and to guide the various treatment options which may start as early as in the fetal time period. Prenatal ultrasound may be limited in the correct identification of subtle \"additional\" lesions that would point to the \"overall\" diagnosis. The high spatial resolution and various anatomical and functional image contrasts that can be generated by prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have proven to be especially beneficial for complex fetal brain pathologies. In addition, prenatal MRI allows study of the entire fetus including the spinal cord and canal. In the current manuscript the various fetal MRI techniques are being discussed. In addition, the various causes of isolated, acquired and syndromal ventriculomegaly are presented as well as their imaging appearance on fetal MRI. Finally, a short summary on the various theories on ventriculomegaly versus hydrocephalus are presented."

Nanostructuring is achieved by combining electron beam lithography with the so-called shadow evaporation technique which involves a two-step Au vapor deposition through a suspended Ge mask while the substrate is tilted in opposite directions. This results in a regular triangular surface pattern with extremely small gap distances that allow positive enhancement of the local electric fields by enabling improvements in the electromagnetic coupling between adjacent nanoparticles. The resulting SERS active surfaces are suitable for the realization of reference procedures for quantifying marker molecules like urea or creatinine at physiologically relevant concentrations."

            "abstract": "Chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) has proven to be a powerful tool in postnatal patients with intellectual disabilities, and it is increasingly used in prenatal diagnosis. However, its diagnostic capabilities in prenatal diagnosis vary, and clinical experiences have failed to establish a consensus regarding CMA indications, the design and resolution of microarrays, and the notification and interpretation of copy number variations (CNVs). We present our 5 years of clinical experience using whole-genome high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to investigate 446 fetuses that had structural malformations detected with ultrasound but for which standard karyotyping analysis showed normal karyotypes. CMA revealed genomic CNVs in 323 (72.4%) cases and clinically significant CNVs in 11.4% of the fetuses (51/446), including 2 cases of uniparental disomy (UPD) as well as 1 case of cryptic mosaic monosomy of chromosome X. Variants of unknown significance (VOUS) existed in 2.0% of the tested fetuses (9/446). Our results demonstrate the value of whole-genome high-resolution SNP arrays in fetuses with congenital malformations and give a higher detection rate of clinically significant genomic imbalance, especially for detecting UPD. Sufficient communication between technicians and genetic counselors, along with parental testing and comparison with data from in-house or international sources, can significantly reduce VOUS."

At the same time increased incidence of the late complications of prematurity such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) has become a growing problem. The aim of the study was to identify groups of genes potentially involved in the development of long-term complications of prematurity, by conducting genome wide microarray expression analysis. The prospective cohort study was conducted, 52 premature babies were included. At the 5th, 14th and 28th day of life samples of the peripheral blood were taken from the study participants. Subsequently, total RNA was extracted and microarray experiment, with the use of GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix), was performed. The analysis of the results was carried out in the separate cohorts of prematures. Within 52 infants 2 groups were distinguished--children without BPD (n = 25) and children with BPD (n = 27). Significant difference in the expression of 251 genes was observed. Additionally, a group of 20 participants of the study, in whom ROP was diagnosed, was compared with the group of the remaining 32 children without proven retinopathy. The analysis revealed a significant difference in the expression between the analyzed groups with regard to 752 genes. Further study is needed to verify the obtained results. The impact of the over- and underexpressed genes should be studied, as well as detailed analysis of the metabolic pathways should be performed."

To increase the sensitivity and specificity of microarrays, surface blocking is required to minimize the nonspecific interactions between analytes and unprinted yet functionalized surfaces. To block amine- or epoxy-functionalized substrates, bovine serum albumin (BSA) is one of the most commonly used blocking reagents because it is cheap and easy to use. Based on standard protocols from microarray manufactories, a BSA concentration of 1% (10 mg/mL or 200 μM) and reaction time of at least 30 min are required to efficiently block epoxy-coated slides. In this paper, we used both fluorescent and label-free methods to characterize the BSA blocking efficiency on epoxy-functionalized substrates. The blocking efficiency of BSA was characterized using a fluorescent scanner and a label-free oblique-incidence reflectivity difference (OI-RD) microscope. We found that (1) a BSA concentration of 0.05% (0.5 mg/mL or 10 μM) could give a blocking efficiency of 98%, and (2) the BSA blocking step took only about 5 min to be complete. Also, from real-time and in situ measurements, we were able to calculate the conformational properties (thickness, mass density, and number density) of BSA molecules deposited on the epoxy surface."

A multiplexed version of the Lawrence Livermore Microbial Detection Array (LLMDA) was developed and evaluated with minimum detectable concentrations for pure unamplified DNA viruses, along with mixtures of viral and bacterial DNA subjected to different whole genome amplification protocols. In addition the performance of the array was tested when hybridization time was reduced from 17 h to 1h. The LLMDA was able to detect unamplified vaccinia virus DNA at a concentration of 14 fM, or 100,000 genome copies in 12 μL of sample. With amplification, positive identification was made with only 100 genome copies of input material. When tested against human stool samples from patients with acute gastroenteritis, the microarray detected common gastroenteritis viral and bacterial infections such as rotavirus and E. coli. Accurate detection was found but with a 4-fold drop in sensitivity for a 1h compared to a 17 h hybridization. The array detected 2 ng (equivalent concentration of 15.6 fM) of labeled DNA from a virus with 1h hybridization without any amplification, and was able to identify the components of a mixture of viruses and bacteria at species and in some cases strain level resolution. Sensitivity improved by three orders of magnitude with random whole genome amplification prior to hybridization; for instance, the array detected a DNA virus with only 20 fg or 100 genome copies as input. This multiplexed microarray is an efficient tool to analyze clinical and environmental samples for the presence of multiple viral and bacterial pathogens rapidly."

For this aim, we used the software called TRAM (Transcriptome Mapper), which is able to generate transcriptome maps based on gene expression data from multiple sources. We also analyzed differential expression by comparing the hippocampus with the whole brain transcriptome map to identify a typical expression pattern of this subregion compared with the whole organ. Finally, due to the fact that the hippocampus is one of the main brain region to be severely affected in trisomy 21 (the best known genetic cause of intellectual disability), a particular attention was paid to the expression of chromosome 21 (chr21) genes. Data were downloaded from microarray databases, processed, and analyzed using TRAM software. Among the main findings, the most over-expressed loci in the hippocampus are the expressed sequence tag cluster Hs.732685 and the member of the calmodulin gene family CALM2. The tubulin folding cofactor B (TBCB) gene is the best gene at behaving like a housekeeping gene. The hippocampus vs. the whole brain differential transcriptome map shows the over-expression of LINC00114, a long non-coding RNA mapped on chr21. The hippocampus transcriptome map was validated in vitro by assaying gene expression through several magnitude orders by \"Real-Time\" reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The highly significant agreement between in silico and experimental data suggested that our transcriptome map may be a useful quantitative reference benchmark for gene expression studies related to human hippocampus. Furthermore, our analysis yielded biological insights about those genes that have an intrinsic over-/under-expression in the hippocampus."

A chromosome analysis showed interstitial deletion of chromosome 3q23-q25.1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and microarray-based genomic analysis revealed the heterozygous deletion of ZIC1 and ZIC4 loci on 3q24. Her facial features were not consistent with those observed in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) involving FOXL2 abnormality.

The most common genetic cause is L1CAM-related X-linked hydrocephalus and that explains only 5%-10% of all male cases. This underlines a current limitation in our understanding of the genetic burden of non-syndromic congenital hydrocephalus, especially for those cases with likely autosomal recessive inheritance. Additionally, the prognosis for most cases of severe congenital hydrocephalus is poor, with most of the surviving infants displaying significant intellectual impairment despite surgical intervention. It is for this reason that couples with an antenatal diagnosis of severe hydrocephalus are given the option, and may opt, for termination of the pregnancy. We present two families with CCDC88C-related recessive congenital hydrocephalus with children who had severe hydrocephalus. Those individuals who were shunted within the first few weeks of life, who did not require multiple surgical revisions, and who had a more distal truncating variant of the CCDC88C gene met their early childhood developmental milestones in some cases. This suggests that children with CCDC88C-related autosomal recessive hydrocephalus can have normal developmental outcomes under certain circumstances. We recommend CCDC88C analysis in cases of severe non-syndromic congenital hydrocephalus, especially when aqueduct stenosis with or without a medial diverticulum is seen, in order to aid prognosis discussion."

Progressive ventriculomegaly and an enlarged brain were consistently observed in knockout mice from embryonic day 12.5 through to adulthood. Transcriptome profiling revealed severe dysfunctions in progenitor maintenance in the ventricular zone and therefore in cilium biogenesis after β-catenin knockout. Histological analyses also revealed an aberrant neuronal layout in both the ventral and dorsal telencephalon in hydrocephalic mice at both embryonic and postnatal stages.

Pathogenic chromosomal abnormalities (numeric and pathogenic copy number variants) detected by chromosomal microarray analysis were significantly more common in the nonisolated congenital heart disease group (64.5%; n=49) compared with the isolated group (22%; n=31; P<.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In pregnancies that were diagnosed with congenital heart disease and had undergone diagnostic genetic testing, our study showed that chromosomal microarray analysis has an added value in the detection of pathogenic chromosomal abnormalities compared with conventional karyotype, particularly in cases of pathogenic copy number variants.

Biallelic mutations in the PKHD1 gene underlie this condition. We describe a child with bilaterally enlarged cystic kidneys, portal hypertension, and cerebral ventriculomegaly. Molecular genetic investigations using whole-exome sequencing and confirmation using Sanger sequencing revealed a homozygous pathogenic mutation in PKHD1 underlying the clinical phenotype of ARPKD. Whole-exome data analysis was used to search for additional rare variants in additional ciliopathy genes that may have contributed to the unusual brain phenotype. Aside from a rare hypomorphic allele in MKS1, no other pathogenic variants were detected. We conclude that the homozygous pathogenic mutation in PKHD1 underlies the ciliopathy phenotype in this patient."

            "abstract": "Congenital hydrocephalus (CH), featuring markedly enlarged brain ventricles, is thought to arise from failed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homeostasis and is treated with lifelong surgical CSF shunting with substantial morbidity. CH pathogenesis is poorly understood. Exome sequencing of 125 CH trios and 52 additional probands identified three genes with significant burden of rare damaging de novo or transmitted mutations: TRIM71 (p = 2.15 × 10-7), SMARCC1 (p = 8.15 × 10-10), and PTCH1 (p = 1.06 × 10-6). Additionally, two de novo duplications were identified at the SHH locus, encoding the PTCH1 ligand (p = 1.2 × 10-4). Together, these probands account for ∼10% of studied cases. Strikingly, all four genes are required for neural tube development and regulate ventricular zone neural stem cell fate. These results implicate impaired neurogenesis (rather than active CSF accumulation) in the pathogenesis of a subset of CH patients, with potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic ramifications."

However, non-biological factors such as systematic changes in sample preparation, differences in scanners, and other potential batch effects are often unavoidable in long-term studies and meta-analysis. In order to reduce the impact of batch effects on microarray data, Johnson, Rabinovic, and Li developed ComBat for use when combining batches of gene expression microarray data. We propose a modification to ComBat that centers data to the location and scale of a pre-determined, 'gold-standard' batch. This modified ComBat (M-Combat) is designed specifically in the context of meta-analysis and batch effect adjustment for use with predictive models that are validated and fixed on historical data from a 'gold-standard' batch.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We combined data from MIRT across two batches ('Old' and 'New' Kit sample preparation) as well as external data sets from the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 and MRC-IX trials into a combined set, first without transformation and then with both ComBat and M-ComBat transformations. Fixed and validated gene risk signatures developed at MIRT on the Old Kit standard (GEP5, GEP70, and GEP80 risk scores) were compared across these combined data sets. Both ComBat and M-ComBat eliminated all of the differences among probes caused by systematic batch effects (over 98% of all untransformed probes were significantly different by ANOVA with 0.01 q-value threshold reduced to zero significant probes with ComBat and M-ComBat). The agreement in mean and distribution of risk scores, as well as the proportion of high-risk subjects identified, coincided with the 'gold-standard' batch more with M-ComBat than with ComBat. The performance of risk scores improved overall using either ComBat or M-Combat; however, using M-ComBat and the original, optimal risk cutoffs allowed for greater ability in our study to identify smaller cohorts of high-risk subjects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      M-ComBat is a practical modification to an accepted method that offers greater power to control the location and scale of batch-effect adjusted data.

We wanted to select a method that would yield \"the best result\" (detected as many \"really\" differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as possible, without false positives and false negatives). However, life scientists could not help us--they use their \"favorite\" method without special argumentation. We also did not find any norm or recommendation. Therefore, we decided to examine it for our own purpose. We considered whether the results obtained using different methods of high-level microarray data analyses--Significant Analysis of Microarrays, Rank Products, Bland-Altman, Mann-Whitney test, T test and the Linear Models for Microarray Data--would be in agreement. Initially, we conducted a comparative analysis of the results on eight real data sets from microarray experiments (from the Array Express database). The results were surprising. On the same array set, the set of DEGs by different methods were significantly different. We also applied the methods to artificial data sets and determined some measures that allow the preparation of the overall scoring of tested methods for future recommendation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We found a very low level concordance of results from tested methods on real array sets. The number of common DEGs (detected by all six methods on fixed array sets, checked on eight array sets) ranged from 6 to 433 (22,283 total array readings). Results on artificial data sets were better than those on the real data. However, they were not fully satisfying. We scored tested methods on accuracy, recall, precision, f-measure and Matthews correlation coefficient. Based on the overall scoring, the best methods were SAM and LIMMA. We also found TT to be acceptable. The worst scoring was MW. Based on our study, we recommend: 1. Carefully taking into account the need for study when choosing a method, 2. Making high-level analysis with more than one method and then only taking the genes that are common to all methods (which seems to be reasonable) and 3. Being very careful (while summarizing facts) about sets of differentially expressed genes: different methods discover different sets of DEGs."

In this study we directly compare exon microarrays to RNA-seq and investigate the ability of both platforms to detect differentially expressed genes following nerve injury using the L5 spinal nerve transection model of neuropathic pain. We also investigate the effects of increasing RNA-seq sequencing depth. Finally we take advantage of the \"agnostic\" approach of RNA-seq to discover areas of expression outside of annotated exons that show marked changes in expression following nerve injury.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      RNA-seq and microarrays largely agree in terms of the genes called as differentially expressed.

In addition, RNA-seq can interrogate the whole genome regardless of prior annotations, being able to detect transcription from areas of the genome not currently annotated as exons. Some of these areas are differentially expressed following nerve injury, and may represent novel genes or isoforms.

Thus far, the use of 1-D arrays has limited coherence measurements and SLSC imaging to a single dimension. Here, the SLSC algorithm is extended for use on 2-D matrix array transducers and applied in a simulation study examining imaging performance as a function of subaperture configuration and of incoherent channel noise. SLSC images generated with a 2-D array yielded superior contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and texture SNR measurements over SLSC images made on a corresponding 1-D array and over B-mode imaging. SLSC images generated with square subapertures were found to be superior to SLSC images generated with subapertures of equal surface area that spanned the whole array in one dimension. Subaperture beamforming was found to have little effect on SLSC imaging performance for subapertures up to 8 x 8 elements in size on a 64 × 64 element transducer. Additionally, the use of 8 x 8, 4 x 4, and 2 x 2 element subapertures provided 8, 4, and 2 times improvement in channel SNR along with 2640-, 328-, and 25-fold reduction in computation time, respectively.

There have been numerous techniques developed for gridding fluorescence images of traditional spotted microarrays but to our best knowledge, no algorithm has yet been developed for gridding bright field images of bead-based microarrays. The proposed gridding method is designed for automatic quality control during fabrication and assembly of bead-based microarrays. The method begins by estimating the grid parameters using an evolutionary algorithm. This is followed by a grid-fitting step that rigidly aligns an ideal grid with the image. Finally, a grid refinement step deforms the ideal grid to better fit the image. The grid fitting and refinement are performed locally and the final grid is a nonlinear (piecewise affine) grid. To deal with extreme corruptions in the image, the initial grid parameter estimation and grid-fitting steps employ robust search techniques. The proposed method does not have any free parameters that need tuning. The method is capable of identifying the grid structure even in the presence of extreme amounts of artifacts and distortions. Evaluation results on a variety of images are presented."

Expanding the utility of microarrays as a detection tool for various biological and biomedical applications requires information about performance such as the limits of detection and quantification, which are considered as an essential information to decide the detection sensitivity of sensing devices. Here we present a calibration design that integrates detection limit theory and linear dynamic range to obtain a performance index of microarray detection platform using oligonucleotide arrays as a model system. Two different types of limits of detection and quantification are proposed by the prediction or tolerance interval for two common cyanine fluorescence dyes, Cy3 and Cy5. Besides oligonucleotide, the proposed method can be generalized to other microarray formats with various biomolecules such as complementary DNA, protein, peptide, carbohydrate, tissue, or other small biomolecules.

Data were stratified into three groups; mild (Vp = 10-12 mm), moderate (Vp = 13-15 mm) and severe (Vp > 15 mm) ventriculomegaly.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were 213 fetuses included for analysis. Of these 42.7% had mild ventriculomegaly, 44.6% severe and 12.7% had moderate ventriculomegaly. Initial ultrasound assessment reported isolated ventriculomegaly in 45.5% fetuses, with additional structural abnormalities in 54.5%. The rate of chromosomal/genetic abnormalities was high,16.4%. After all investigations, the true rate of isolated VM was 36.1%. The overall survival was 85.6%. Survival was higher for those with isolated VM across all groups (P < 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Ventriculomegaly is a complex condition and patients should be counselled that even with apparently isolated VM, there remains the possibility of additional genetic and/or structural problems being diagnosed in up to 10% of fetuses."

Proper combination of the liposome components (Zn(II)-dipicolylamine for phosphate binding and an amine-terminated component for anchoring the liposome onto an aldehyde-derivatized glass plate), has led to a microarray chip that selectively detects pyrophosphate, an important biomarker, over competing anions, such as phosphate and adenosine triphosphate, with nanomolar sensitivity. The chip-based assay shows advantages, such as high specificity and sensitivity, over solution-based assays that use the same liposomes, and over known homogeneous molecular sensing systems."

Principally, whole genome-based analysis of copy number changes using microarrays has led to this method replacing conventional karyotyping as a routine diagnostic workhorse. The resolution offered by microarrays is an improvement of at least an order of magnitude compared to karyotyping, but it comes at a cost in terms of the time spent in data interpretation. Overall, however, the die has been cast and cytogeneticists need to become familiar with the tools use by molecular geneticists and bioinformaticists. The following review provides a brief background to array technology, but uses a series of case studies to illustrate the usefulness and challenges of interpreting array data."

In recent studies, a limited number of genetic causes of hydrocephalus have been identified. To date, recessive mutations in the CCDC88C gene have been identified as a cause of non-syndromic congenital hydrocephalus in three reported families. Here, we report the fourth known family with two affected individuals with congenital hydrocephalus due to a homozygous mutation in the CCDC88C gene identified by whole exome sequencing. Our two newly described children, as well as the previously published ones, all shared several features including severe infantile-onset hydrocephalus, mild to severe intellectual delay, varying degrees of motor delay, and infantile onset seizures. All identified homozygous mutations in CCDC88C abolish the PDZ binding site necessary for proper CCDC88C protein function in the Wnt signaling pathway. Our report further establishes CCDC88C as one of the few known recessive causes of severe prenatal-onset hydrocephalus. Recognition of this syndrome has important diagnostic and genetic implications for families identified in the future."

The output is high-density time-course data showing redox curves (approximating growth) for each experimental condition. The software provided with the Omnilog incubator/reader summarizes each time-course as a single datum, so most of the information is not used. However, the time courses can be extremely varied and often contain detailed qualitative (shape of curve) and quantitative (values of parameters) information. We present a novel, Bayesian approach to estimating parameters from Phenotype Microarray data, fitting growth models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to enable high throughput estimation of important information, including length of lag phase, maximal \"growth\" rate and maximum output. We find that the Baranyi model for microbial growth is useful for fitting Biolog data. Moreover, we introduce a new growth model that allows for diauxic growth with a lag phase, which is particularly useful where Phenotype Microarrays have been applied to cells grown in complex mixtures of substrates, for example in industrial or biotechnological applications, such as worts in brewing. Our approach provides more useful information from Biolog data than existing, competing methods, and allows for valuable comparisons between data series and across different models."

The system has been designed for crystallization condition screening, visual crystal inspection, initial X-ray screening and data collection in a high-throughput fashion. X-ray diffraction data acquisition can be performed directly on-the-chip at room temperature using an in situ approach. The capabilities of the chip eliminate the necessity for manual crystal handling and cryoprotection of crystal samples, while allowing data collection from multiple crystals in the same drop. This technology would be especially beneficial for projects with large volumes of data, such as protein-complex studies and fragment-based screening. The platform employs hydrophilic and hydrophobic concentric ring surfaces on a miniature plate transparent to visible light and X-rays to create a well defined and stable microbatch crystallization environment. The results of crystallization and data-collection experiments demonstrate that high-quality well diffracting crystals can be grown and high-resolution diffraction data sets can be collected using this technology. Furthermore, the quality of a single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data set collected with the X-CHIP at room temperature was sufficient to generate interpretable electron-density maps. This technology is highly resource-efficient owing to the use of nanolitre-scale drop volumes. It does not require any modification for most in-house and synchrotron beamline systems and offers a promising opportunity for full automation of the X-ray structure-determination process."

Both similarities and differences in glycan patterns are identified on EVs obtained under each experimental condition. EV size- and isolation method-dependent lectin-binding patterns are observed. Moreover, cellular uptake behaviors of EVs are affected by EV glycan profiles and acceptor cells. The in vivo biodistribution of EVs is also dependent on their glycan profile. These results suggest that EV surface glycans are a potential novel indicator of EV heterogeneity, and glycoengineering is a useful approach to regulate cell-EV interactions for biomedical applications."

            "abstract": "Microarray analysis is a powerful tool to simultaneously determine the pattern of transcription of large amounts of genes. For data post-processing distinct computational methods are currently used that, however, lead to different results regarding the genes expressed differentially. Herein, a new methodology for microarray data analysis named Q-GDEMAR is presented. It combines the quantile characterization of the entire distribution together with the Gaussian deconvolution of the central region of the microarray data distribution. Three discriminant variable variants are proposed that allow us to summarize data and compare groups even when their size is strongly unbalanced. In addition, a simple procedure to compute the false discovery rate (FDR) is also presented. The performance of the method is compared with that observed when using LIMMA (Linear Models Microarray) software as reference. In 58 out of 68 cases, Q-GDEMAR showed a higher sensitivity than LIMMA to detect differentially expressed genes (p = 1 × 10(-10)). The proposed method does not produce biased information, detecting genes with high sensitivity equally well at both tails of the distribution (p = 0.7428). Moreover, all detected genes were associated with very low levels of FDR (median value = 0.67%, interquartile range = 0.87%). Q-GDEMAR can be used as a general method for microarray analysis, but is particularly indicated when the conditions to be compared are unbalanced. The superior performance of Q-GEDEMAR is the consequence of its higher discriminative power and, the fact that it yields a univocal correspondence between the p-values and the values of the discriminating variable. Q-GDEMAR was tested only using Affymetrix microarrays. However, given that it operates after the step of data standardization, it can be used with the same quality features on any of the available mono- or dual-channel microarray platforms."

In PCR studies, genes designated as \"housekeeping genes\" have been used as internal reference genes under the assumption that their expression is stable and independent of experimental conditions. However, verification of this assumption is rarely performed. Here we assess the use of gene microarray analysis to facilitate selection of internal reference sequences with higher expression stability across experimental conditions than can be expected using traditional selection methods.We recently demonstrated that relative gene expression from qRT-PCR data normalized using GAPDH, ALG9 and RPL13A expression values mirrored relative expression using quantile normalization in Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) on the Affymetrix GeneChip rhesus Macaque Genome Array.Having shown that qRT-PCR and Affymetrix GeneChip data from the same hormone replacement therapy (HRT) study yielded concordant results, we used quantile-normalized gene microarray data to identify the most stably expressed among probe sets for prospective internal reference genes across three brain regions from the HRT study and an additional study of normally menstruating rhesus macaques (cycle study). Gene selection was limited to 575 previously published human \"housekeeping\" genes. Twelve animals were used per study, and three brain regions were analyzed from each animal.

Most of these biological activities occur through specific interactions with glucan-recognizing proteins. However, detailed molecular studies of glucan recognition remain a challenge mainly due to the inherent sequence heterogeneity and polydispersity of glucan polysaccharides, and associated difficulties in their purification and sequence characterization. It is thus ideal to have a series of sequence-defined glucooligosaccharides to represent the sequence diversity of glucan polysaccharides and to apply these to gain insight into glucan recognition processes. In this chapter, we describe the the methods for developing of oligosaccharide microarrays derived from a collection of glucans with different linkages based on the neoglycolipid (NGL) microarray system. The microscale oxime-ligation method has provided access in microarrays to over 150 sequence-defined glucooligosaccharides with different chain lengths, linkages, and branching patterns. We focus on the essential steps in the preparation of NGL-based glucooligosaccharide microarrays, which include (1) the depolymerization and purification methods to obtain oligosaccharide fractions of defined chain lengths; (2) a mass spectrometry-based method for linkage and sequence analysis of glucooligosaccharides; (3) improved procedures for preparation of oxime-linked NGLs from glucooligosaccharides for construction of microarrays; and (4) analyses of the recognition of these oligosaccharide sequences by various glucan-recognizing proteins: monoclonal antibodies, other proteins of the immune system such as Dectin-1 and DC-SIGN, and carbohydrate-binding modules of bacterial glycoside hydrolases."

The ever-increasing number of recording electrodes on microelectrode probes calls for an automated selection of electrodes containing \"good quality signals\" or \"signals of interest.\" This article reviews the different criteria for electrode selection as well as the basic signal processing steps to prepare the data to compute those criteria. We discuss three of them.

It is demonstrated that the dynamic nanomixers can improve the assay kinetics at least by a factor of 4 and 2 for DNA and protein microarray assays, respectively. By using the dynamic nanomixers, the sensitivities of detecting Escherichia coli O157:H7 DNA and prostate specific antigen increase by more than four-fold. The dynamic mixing also greatly reduces the spot-to-spot variation to below 10% across a broad concentration range, providing more accurate assay results.

The principal drawback of SVM-RFE is the huge time consumption. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a more efficient implementation of linear support vector machines and improve the recursive feature elimination strategy and then combine them together to select informative genes. Besides, we propose a simple resampling method to preprocess the datasets, which makes the information distribution of different kinds of samples balanced and the classification results more credible.

Microarraying allows the production of scores of replicate slides. Small molecule libraries are typically stored as 10 mM DMSO stock solutions, whereas libraries of biomolecules are typically stored in high percentages of glycerol. Thus, a method is required to print such libraries on microarrays, and then assay them against biological targets. By printing either small molecule libraries or biomolecule libraries in an aqueous solvent containing glycerol, each adherent nanodroplet remains fixed at a position on the microarray by surface tension without the use of wells, without evaporating, and without the need for chemically linking the compound to the surface. Importantly, glycerol is a high boiling point solvent that is fully miscible with DMSO and water and has the additional property of stabilizing various enzymes. The nanoliter volume of the droplet forms the reaction compartment once additional reagents are metered onto the microarray, either by aerosol spray deposition or by addressable acoustic dispensing. Incubation of the nanodroplet microarray in a high humidity environment controls the final water content of the reaction. This platform has been validated for fluorescent HTS assays of protease and kinases as well as for fluorogenic substrate profiling of proteases. Label-free HTS is also possible by running nanoliter HTS reactions on a MALDI target for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis without the need for desalting of the samples. A method is described for running nanoliter-scale multicomponent homogeneous reactions followed by label-free MALDI MS spectrometry analysis of the reactions."

Chemically related to nucleic acid probes, production of aptamers against targets of various sizes and compositions places them as ideal capture elements, alternative to more consolidated molecules such as antibodies. Thanks to their chemical simplicity and production, as well as their unique characteristics, aptamers have been successfully integrated in several innovative approaches. The incorporation of aptamers into the existing microarray technologies has lead to the reporting of various detection strategies, including direct fluorescence detection of fluorescent reporters, fluorescence anisotropy, FRET, SPR imaging, and electrochemical detection."

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used for the precise determination of the amount of alkanethiol molecules transferred and SAMs formed on the microarray. We can also control the oxidative and reductive state of each molecule displayed to cells by CV.

Current guidelines for clinical genetic testing recommend a G-banded karyotype to detect chromosomal abnormalities and fragile X DNA testing, but guidelines for chromosomal microarray analysis have not been established.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      A cohort of 933 patients received clinical genetic testing for a diagnosis of ASD between January 2006 and December 2008. Clinical genetic testing included G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, and chromosomal microarray (CMA) to test for submicroscopic genomic deletions and duplications. Diagnostic yield of clinically significant genetic changes was compared.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Karyotype yielded abnormal results in 19 of 852 patients (2.23% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.73%-2.73%]), fragile X testing was abnormal in 4 of 861 (0.46% [95% CI: 0.36%-0.56%]), and CMA identified deletions or duplications in 154 of 848 patients (18.2% [95% CI: 14.76%-21.64%]). CMA results for 59 of 848 patients (7.0% [95% CI: 5.5%-8.5%]) were considered abnormal, which includes variants associated with known genomic disorders or variants of possible significance. CMA results were normal in 10 of 852 patients (1.2%) with abnormal karyotype due to balanced rearrangements or unidentified marker chromosome. CMA with whole-genome coverage and CMA with targeted genomic regions detected clinically relevant copy-number changes in 7.3% (51 of 697) and 5.3% (8 of 151) of patients, respectively, both higher than karyotype. With the exception of recurrent deletion and duplication of chromosome 16p11.2 and 15q13.2q13.3, most copy-number changes were unique or identified in only a small subset of patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      CMA had the highest detection rate among clinically available genetic tests for patients with ASD. Interpretation of microarray data is complicated by the presence of both novel and recurrent copy-number variants of unknown significance.

This study used gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to represent the spatial distribution among high density (HD) electrodes and improved its calculation based on the using condition of myoelectric system, proposing a new feature, iGLCM, to improve the robustness of the system. The effects of its two parameters, quantization level and input data, were first evaluated and it was found that improved discrete Fourier transform (iDFT) performed better than the other three (time-domain, autoregressive, root mean square) as the input data of iGLCM, and increasing quantization level did not significantly decrease the error rate of iGLCM when it was above 8. The performance of iGLCM with iDFT as input data and 8 as quantization level was subsequently compared with previous robust approaches (time domain autoregressive, variogram, common spatial pattern and optimal less channel configuration) and its input data, iDFT. It was showed that iGLCM achieved comparable classification accuracy without shift, and significantly decreased the sensitivity to electrode shift with 1 cm (p < 0.05). More importantly, it could reduce the perpendicular shift distance to half interelectrode distance with the electrodes worn as a band around the circumference of the forearm. Combined with the small interelectrode distance of HD electrodes, it provided a way to control the effect of perpendicular shifts fundamentally, which were the main source of performance degradation. Finally, the analysis of feature space revealed that the robustness was improved by discarding information sensitivity to shift and keeping as much as useful information. This study highlighted the importance of HD electrodes in robust myoelectric control, and the outcome would help the design of robust control system based on pattern recognition and promote its application in real-world condition."

Many microarray experiments have been designed to investigate the genetic mechanisms of cancer, and analytical approaches have been applied in order to classify different types of cancer or distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue. However, microarrays are high-dimensional datasets with high levels of noise and this causes problems when using machine learning methods. A popular approach to this problem is to search for a set of features that will simplify the structure and to some degree remove the noise from the data. The most widely used approach to feature extraction is principal component analysis (PCA) which assumes a multivariate Gaussian model of the data. More recently, non-linear methods have been investigated. Among these, manifold learning algorithms, for example Isomap, aim to project the data from a higher dimensional space onto a lower dimension one. We have proposed a priori manifold learning for finding a manifold in which a representative set of microarray data is fused with relevant data taken from the KEGG pathway database. Once the manifold has been constructed the raw microarray data is projected onto it and clustering and classification can take place. In contrast to earlier fusion based methods, the prior knowledge from the KEGG databases is not used in, and does not bias the classification process--it merely acts as an aid to find the best space in which to search the data. In our experiments we have found that using our new manifold method gives better classification results than using either PCA or conventional Isomap."

            "abstract": "With its low-cost fabrication and ease of modification, paper-based analytical devices have developed rapidly in recent years. Microarrays allow automatic analysis of multiple samples or multiple reactions with minimal sample consumption. While cellulose paper is generally used, its high backgrounds in spectrometry outside of the visible range has limited its application to be mostly colorimetric analysis. In this work, glass-microfiber paper is used as the substrate for a microarray. The glass-microfiber is essentially chemically inert SiOx, and the lower background from this inorganic microfiber can avoid interference from organic analytes in various spectrometers. However, generally used wax printing fails to wet glass microfibers to form hydrophobic barriers. Therefore, to prepare the hydrophobic-hydrophilic pattern, the glass-microfiber paper was first modified with an octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) to make the paper hydrophobic. A hydrophilic microarray was then prepared using a CO2 laser scriber that selectively removed the OTS layer with a designed pattern. One microliter of aqueous drops of peptides at various concentrations were then dispensed inside the round patterns where OTS SAM was removed while the surrounding area with OTS layer served as a barrier to separate each drop. The resulting specimen of multiple spots was automatically analyzed with a time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (ToF-SIMS), and all of the secondary ions were collected. Among the various cluster ions that have developed over the past decade, pulsed C60+ was selected as the primary ion because of its high secondary ion intensity in the high mass region, its minimal alteration of the surface when operating within the static-limit and spatial resolution at the ∼μm level. In the resulting spectra, parent ions of various peptides (in the forms [M+H]+ and [M+Na]+) were readily identified for parallel detection of molecules in a mixture. By normalizing the ion intensity of peptides with respect to the glass-microfiber matrix ([SiOH]+), a linear calibration curve for each peptide was generated to quantify these components in a mixture."

Fortunately, this dilemma can be solved.

We report the first patients, a brother and a sister, with Fowler syndrome and survival beyond infancy. The patients present a phenotype of severe intellectual and neurologic disability with seizures, absence of functional movements, and no means of communication. Imaging of the brain showed calcifications, profound ventriculomegaly with only a thin edging of the cerebral cortex and hypoplastic cerebellum. Investigation with whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed, in both patients, a homozygous pathogenic mutation in FLVCR2, c.1289C>T, compatible with a diagnosis of Fowler syndrome. The results highlight the power of combining WES with a thorough clinical examination in order to identify disease-causing mutations in patients whose clinical presentation differs from previously described cases.

However, mosaicism may be missed due to multiple factors including failure to recognize clinical indications and order appropriate testing, technical limitations of diagnostic assays, or sampling tissue (s) in which mosaicism is either not present, or present at very low levels. Blood leukocytes have long been the \"gold standard\" sample for cytogenetic analysis; however, the culturing process for routine chromosome analysis can complicate detection of mosaicism since the normal cell line may have a growth advantage in culture, or may not be present in the cells that produce metaphases (the lymphocytes). Buccal cells are becoming increasingly utilized for clinical analyses and are proving to have many advantages. Buccal swabs allow for simple and noninvasive DNA collection. When coupled with a chromosomal microarray that contains single nucleotide polymorphic probes, analysis of buccal cells can maximize a clinician's opportunity to detect cytogenetic mosaicism. We present three cases of improved diagnosis of mosaic aberrations using buccal specimens for chromosomal microarray analysis. In each case, the aberration was either undetectable in blood or present at such a low level it likely could have gone undetected. These cases highlight the limitations of certain laboratory methodologies for identifying mosaicism. We also present practice implications for genetic counselors, including clinic workflow changes and counseling approaches based on increasing use of buccal samples."

To aid in the mechanistic study of mechanotransduction, herein we devised a cell stretching device that allowed for quantitative control and real-time measurement of mechanical stimuli and cellular biomechanical responses. Our strategy involved a microfabricated array of silicone elastomeric microposts integrated onto a stretchable elastomeric membrane. Using a computer-controlled vacuum, this micropost array membrane (mPAM) was activated to apply equibiaxial cell stretching forces to adherent cells attached to the microposts. Using the mPAM, we studied the live-cell subcellular dynamic responses of contractile forces in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to a sustained static equibiaxial cell stretch. Our data showed that in response to a sustained cell stretch, VSMCs regulated their cytoskeletal (CSK) contractility in a biphasic manner: they first acutely enhanced their contraction to resist rapid cell deformation ('stiffening') before they allowed slow adaptive inelastic CSK reorganization to release their contractility ('softening'). The contractile response across entire single VSMCs was spatially inhomogeneous and force-dependent. Our mPAM device and live-cell subcellular contractile measurements will help elucidate the mechanotransductive system in VSMCs and thus contribute to our understanding of pressure-induced vascular disease processes."

A positive dielectrophoretic force was selectively applied by energizing appropriate electrodes to capture the dispersed cells at the bottom electrode, while the micro-wells were designed to confine cells in situ when the positive dielectrophoretic force is removed. The combination of spatial positive dielectrophoresis (pDEP) and micro-wells made it possible to construct cell microarrays with specific patterns.

However, very fast reactions are difficult to resolve below this limit. We now outline an approach that provides access to ultrafast kinetics but does not rely on active mixing at all. Here, the reagents are compartmentalized into water-in-oil emulsion microdroplets (diameter ∼50 μm) that are statically arrayed in pairs, resting side-by-side in a well feature of a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) device. A reaction between the contents of two droplets arrayed in such a holding trap is initiated by droplet fusion that is brought about by electrocoalescence and known to occur on a time scale of about 100 μs. A reaction between the reactants (Fe(3+) and SCN(-)) is monitored by image analysis measuring the product formation in the newly merged drop in both space and time, by use of a fast camera. A comparison of the concentration field of the reaction product with the output of a reaction-diffusion system of equations yields a rate constant k ∼ 3 × 10(4) M(-3)·s(-1). Since reaction and diffusion are formally included in the mathematical model, measurements can proceed immediately after the drop fusion, removing the need to allow time for mixing. This approach is different from existing methodologies, for example, experiments in a conventional stopped-flow apparatus but also electrofusion of moving droplets where contents are mixed by chaotic advection before a reaction is monitored. Our analysis makes kinetics accessible that are several times faster than techniques that have to allow time for mixing."

In the current work, we improved the situation by developing a new microarray substrate based on a fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) membrane. A polydopamine microspot array was fabricated on the FEP membrane, with proteins conjugated to the FEP surface through polydopamine. Uniform microspots were obtained on FEP without the application of a special printing solution. The modified FEP membrane demonstrated ultralow background signal and was applied in protein and peptide microarray analysis."

This novel approach is based upon the principle of nanosphere lithography and can be used for one-step antibody immobilization. The developed platform was checked by functionalizing with cysteine followed by capturing biotinylated antibody and detecting it with dye-conjugated steptravidin. An immunoassay was performed with spiked samples containing human fetuin A antigen. The minimum limits of detection (LOD) of human fetuin A for NA-based and conventional microarray platforms were 50 pg/mL and 50 ng/mL, respectively. The developed approach was highly reproducible and unlike conventional microarray approaches the use of a spotting system was omitted because immobilization was controlled and directed on the predefined arrays. This approach could be an ideal alternative for developing microarrays. And, the ease of the strategy also allows the high throughput production of the microarrays."

            "abstract": "Fetal ventriculomegaly (VM) is a condition in which one or both lateral ventricles are enlarged, and is diagnosed as an atrial diameter larger than 10 mm. Evidence of altered cortical folding associated with VM has been shown in the literature. However, existing works use a single scalar value such as diagnosis or lateral ventricular volume to characterize VM and study its relationship with alterations in cortical folding, thus failing to reveal the spatially-heterogeneous associations. In this work, we propose a novel approach to identify fine-grained associations between cortical folding and ventricular enlargement by leveraging the vertex-wise correlations between their growth patterns in terms of area expansion and curvature. Our approach comprises three steps. In the first step, we define a joint graph Laplacian matrix using cortex-to-ventricle correlations. The joint Laplacian is built based on multiple cortical features. Next, we propose a spectral embedding of the cortex-to-ventricle graph into a common underlying space where its nodes are projected according to the joint ventricle-cortex growth patterns. In this low-dimensional joint ventricle-cortex space, associated growth patterns lie close to each other. In the final step, we perform hierarchical clustering in the joint embedded space to identify associated sub-regions between cortex and ventricle. Using a dataset of 25 healthy fetuses and 23 fetuses with isolated non-severe VM within the age range of 26-29 gestational weeks, our approach reveals clinically relevant and heterogeneous regional associations. Cortical regions forming these associations are further validated using statistical analysis, revealing regions with altered folding that are significantly associated with ventricular dilation."

For functional studies, Ciona eggs are considerably more challenging to microinject than the much larger eggs of other model organisms such as zebrafish and Xenopus. One of the key difficulties is in restraining the eggs so that the microinjection needle can be easily introduced and withdrawn. Here we develop and test a device to cast wells in agarose that are each sized to hold a single egg. This injection mold is fabricated by micro-resolution stereolithography with a grid of egg-sized posts that cast corresponding wells in agarose. This 3D printing technology allows the rapid and inexpensive testing of iteratively refined prototypes.

Among these nanomaterials, graphene is well suited for a practical candidate for implementing a large-scale array of biomolecular sensors, as its two-dimensional morphology is readily compatible with industry standard top-down fabrication techniques.

The present chapter, which is a review of this recent work, outlines procedures demonstrating the use of individual graphene sites of the array in dual roles--electrophoretic electrodes for site specific probe DNA immobilization and field effect transistor (FET) sensors for detection of target DNA hybridization. The 100 fM detection sensitivity achieved in 7 out of 8 graphene FET sensors in the array combined with the alternative use of the graphene channels as electrophoretic electrodes for probe deposition represent steps toward creating an all-electrical multiplexed DNA array."

We present a case of CPH diagnosed by fetal MRI at 23 weeks of gestation following referral for ventriculomegaly. The pregnancy was carried to term and the child was monitored clinically and radiologically. Despite the persistence of enlarged choroid plexuses, the ventricular size has progressively decreased, and at the 4-year follow-up the child presented normal psychomotor development. This case highlights the added value of MRI in prenatal diagnosis of fetal ventriculomegaly and its management.

Signature profiles, usually involving several miRNAs, have also been associated with dysfunctional cellular regulation such as in cancer. Profiling miRNAs can be done using the Agilent Technologies miRNA profiling system, which is a sensitive and accurate miRNA microarray assay. The assay is based on a highly efficient labeling method linked to a novel probe design strategy. The labeling method uses a simple, single-vial approach where 100 ng of nonfractionated total RNA is directly labeled by ligation of a Cy3 labeled pCp molecule to the 3' end of the RNA. The labeled cytosine interacts with the guanidine at the 5' end of the probe which adds stability to the hybridization complex. In addition, the probes have been designed to provide both sequence and size discrimination, generally resulting in highly specific detection of closely related mature miRNAs. The labeling and probe design strategies allow for a precise and accurate measurement that spans a linear dynamic range of greater than four orders of magnitude from at least 0.2 amol to 2 fmol of miRNA and a detection limit of less than 0.1 amol.

However, microarray data classification is still a challenging task since there are often a huge number of genes but a small number of samples in gene expression data. As a result, a computational method for reducing the dimension of microarray data is necessary. In this paper, we introduce a computational gene selection model for microarray data classification via adaptive hypergraph embedded dictionary learning (AHEDL). Specifically, a dictionary is learned from the feature space of original high dimensional microarray data, and this learned dictionary is used to represent original genes with a reconstruction coefficient matrix. Then we use a l2, 1-norm regularization to impose the row sparsity on the coefficient matrix for selecting discriminate genes. Meanwhile, in order to capture the localmanifold geometrical structure of original microarray data in a high-order manner, a hypergraph is adaptively learned and embedded into the model. An iterative updating algorithm is designed for solving the optimization problem. In order to validate the efficacy of the proposed model, we have conducted experiments on six publicly available microarray data sets and the results demonstrate that AHEDL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of microarray data classification.

Ideally, the spectrum of clinically significant blood group antigens and alloantibodies would be wider than allowed by current routine tests. At the same time, we are witnessing an increase in emerging and re-emerging human pathogens due to urbanisation, increased international travel and trade, climate change and other factors. The spectrum of blood-borne infectious agents requiring donation screening is expected to grow correspondingly. Dengue and chikungunya viruses, variant CJD and hepatitis E virus represent just some of the candidate infectious agents for future donation screening. Multiplexing techniques, such as microarrays are well suited to address the growing number of targets, pending the increase in sensitivity of some of the microarrays assays. There are several possible scenarios for future testing algorithms, combining new multiplexing techniques with the existing blood testing assays. New generation testing platforms capable of microbiology screening, blood grouping and potential additional types of targets, are also being developed."

While many studies demonstrate the impact of glycan modification on GBP recognition and activity, the relative contribution of subtle changes in glycan structure on GBP binding can be difficult to define. To overcome limitations in the analysis of GBP-glycan interactions, recent studies utilized glycan microarray platforms containing hundreds of structurally defined glycans. These studies not only provided important information regarding GBP-glycan interactions in general but have also resulted in significant insight into binding specificity and biological activity of the galectin family.

            "abstract": "Study methodologies of supersaturated state are fast developing as pharmaceutical industry is adopting supersaturating drug delivery systems (SDDS) to overcome the solubility issue of drugs. The \"parachute\" of sobriquet \"spring-and-parachute\", which indicates delayed or slowed intraluminal precipitation of drug from SDDS, is of immense importance to formulation scientists since optimal attainment of \"parachute\" governs the success of SDDS in stabilizing supersaturated state that ensues in enhancement of bioavailability. The studies carried out so far for precipitation assessments have ignored the stochastic nature of nucleation and lack absolute mathematical approach. In the current study, the supersaturated state has been studied in a quantitative manner through microarray plate method with application of the classical nucleation theory (CNT) equation for determination of precipitation kinetics. This microarray plate method is an attempt to pursue the principle of miniaturization in supersaturation assays and involves comprehensive measurements that allows for accounting of the stochastic nature of nucleation. Overcoming the drawbacks of reproducibility and greater material requirement of existing methods, this study aims to quantify the rate of in vivo precipitation through understanding of precipitation profile of model drug, celecoxib, in biorelevant media. Quantification of nucleation rates was made through CNT using tailored criteria and visually represented through temporal precipitation distribution (TPD) plots. Supersaturation stability was also compared through metastable zone width (MSZW). Optical microscopy helped in visualizing the dynamics of precipitation, while solid state characterization assisted in understanding the nature of obtained precipitates. This study identified the short-lived supersaturation of celecoxib and its tendency to precipitate under fasted conditions, which can be correlated with in vivo behavior for formulation design."

Recently, anti-glycan antibody profiles have been of interest in various cancer studies. Novel advantages in the field of analytical techniques have simplified the analysis of anti-glycan antibodies and made it easier to have more comprehensive knowledge about their functions. One of the robust approaches for studying anti-glycan antibodies engages in microarray technology. The analysis of glycan microarrays can provide more expanded information to simultaneously specify or suggest the role of antibodies to a wide variety of glycans in the progression of different diseases, therefore making it possible to identify new biomarkers for diagnosing cancer and/or the state of the disease.

Fairly skewed distribution of the continuous part coupled with small sample sizes are issues of main concern to be attended for the quality of inference in such situations while popularly used nonparametric methods rely on asymptotic distribution of the underlying test statistics which are valid only under large sample sizes. We address the aforementioned issues via a newly proposed exact test for location-scale family distributions and Generalized pivot quantity (GPQ) based parametric test procedures for non-location-scale distributions.

It is associated with several syndromes, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), which is caused by dysfunction of motile cilia. We previously demonstrated that mouse models of PCD lacking ciliary proteins CFAP221, CFAP54 and SPEF2 all have hydrocephalus with a strain-dependent severity. While morphological defects are more severe on the C57BL/6J (B6) background than 129S6/SvEvTac (129), cerebrospinal fluid flow is perturbed on both backgrounds, suggesting that abnormal cilia-driven flow is not the only factor underlying the hydrocephalus phenotype. Here, we performed a microarray analysis on brains from wild type and nm1054 mice lacking CFAP221 on the B6 and 129 backgrounds. Expression differences were observed for a number of genes that cluster into distinct groups based on expression pattern and biological function, many of them implicated in cellular and biochemical processes essential for proper brain development. These include genes known to be functionally relevant to congenital hydrocephalus, as well as formation and function of both motile and sensory cilia. Identification of these genes provides important clues to mechanisms underlying congenital hydrocephalus severity."

They have been studied extensively as signal transducers in biosensor applications. Here, we describe an antibody-based biosensor using PDA liposomes for detection of human immunoglobulin E (hIgE). Target hIgE chemically bound to hIgE monoclonal antibodies immobilized on PDA liposomes and the fluorescent signals were slightly increased depending on the target protein concentration. As the primary response, the hIgE could be detected to below 10 ng mL(-1). However, fluorescent signals were dramatically increased depending on the target protein concentration when gold nanoparticle-conjugated polyclonal antibody probes were added on the PDA liposomes after the primary immune reaction. A PDA liposome biosensor could detect the hIgE as low as 0.1 ng mL(-1) and the sensitivity was increased up to one hundred times higher than the primary response. As a result, we confirmed that gold nanoparticle-conjugated polyclonal antibody probes efficiently enhanced the fluorescent signal of the PDA liposome biosensor chip. This strategy can be useful to detect proteins of ultra-low concentration."

However, parallelization of magnetic stimulation with multiple coils may generate far greater potential than a single coil, and could thus expand the scope of brain area stimulation. Therefore, we examined whether a multiple coil-based system could improve the effectiveness and focality of conventional single coil-based magnetic stimulation.\n    \n\n\n          Approach:\n        \n      \n      We designed and tested a micromagnetic stimulation (µMS) device with multiple submillimeter-sized coils as a possible substitute for one large coil. Our design concept is spatially-distributed stimulation strategy involving the small number of coils to be able to mimic desired electric field profiles. To this end, the cost function of the error between the desired and coil-induced electric fields was firstly calculated, and coil currents were repetitively estimated to achieve the smaller number of coils under a certain criterion: a minimum error with spatial sparsity. Using these approaches, we evaluated the capability of our multi-channel µMS via numerical simulations and demonstrated responsive results in animal experiments.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Our approach can enhance control of neural excitation and improve the concentration of the excitation field induced by magnetic stimulation with reduced power consumption. Furthermore, in vivo electrophysiological recordings of mouse brain performed to evaluate our proposed approach for brain stimulation demonstrated experimentally that our multi-channel µMS device can yield more effective stimulation than the single-channel device. In addition, our device permitted electronic spatial adjustment of the stimulus shape and location without moving the coils.\n    \n\n\n          Significance:\n        \n      \n      The development of new multichannel µMS-based therapeutic approaches may be useful because the µMS affects only a restricted brain area. Indeed, the small size of micro-coils and their finer focality with multichannel contribution might be suitable for chronic use, which is difficult using conventional large transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with simple round or figure-eight coils. Thus, our findings support new opportunities to explore magnetic stimulation as a therapeutic approach for neurological disorders."

            "abstract": "Gold nanorod (GNR) based label-free sensing has been attractive due to its unique property of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Compared to bulk gold, the SPR of GNRs is more sensitive to the refractive index change caused by biological binding in the close proximity. Numerous studies have reported biological detection in solution based GNR probes. However, the biosensing has the intrinsic problems of fluctuating readings and short storage time due to nanoparticle aggregation. In contrast, a chip-based nanorod biosensor is a more robust and reliable platform. We have developed a nanoplasmonic biosensor in a chip format by immobilizing functionalized GNRs on a (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane modified glass substrate. The covalent Au-S bond ensures a strong GNR deposition on the substrate. This biochip exhibits a high sensitivity and stability when exposed to physiological buffer with high ionic strength. Another advantage of GNR as optical transducer is its LSPR peak dependence on the aspect ratio, which provides an ideal multiplexed detection mechanism. GNRs of different sizes that exhibit distinct SPR peaks are combined and deposited on designated spots of a glass substrate. The spectral shift of the respective peaks upon the biological binding are monitored for simultaneous detection of specific analytes. Coupled with a microplate reader, this spatially resolved GNR array biochip results in a high-throughput assay of samples as well as multiplexed detection in each sample. Since most biological molecules such as antibodies and DNA can be linked to GNR using previously reported surface chemistry protocol, the label-free nanosensor demonstrated here is an effective tool for protein/DNA array analysis, especially for detection of disease biomarkers."

By now, most prominent for imaging label-free interaction analyses on microarrays are imaging surface plasmon resonance (SPR) methods, quartz crystal microbalance, or biolayer interferometry. SPR is sensitive against temperature drifts and suffers from plasmon crosstalk, and all systems lack array size (maximum 96 spots). Our detection system is robust against temperature drifts. Microarrays are analyzed with a spatial resolution of 7 µm and time resolution of ≤50 fps. System sensitivity is competitive, with random noise of <5 × 10-5 and baseline drift of <3 × 10-6. Currently available spotting technologies limit array sizes to ~4 spots/mm2 (1080 spots/array); our detection system would allow ~40 spots/mm2 (10,800 spots/array). The microfluidic flow cells consist of structured PDMS inlays sealed by versatilely coated glass slides immobilizing the microarray. The injection protocol determines reagent volumes, priming rates, and flow cell temperatures for up to 44 reagents; volumes of ≤300 µL are validated.

The biosensor was fabricated with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel microarrays that entrapped acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and quantum dots (QDs) as fluorescence reporters. Metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) was utilized to amplify the fluorescence signal, which was achieved by decorating QDs on the surface of silica-coated silver nanoparticles (Ag@Silica). The MEF effects of Ag@Silica were optimized by tuning the thickness of the silica shells, and under the optimized conditions, the fluorescence intensity was shown to be increased 5 fold, compared with the system without MEF. PEG hydrogel microarray entrapping QD-decorated Ag@Silica and AChE was prepared via photopatterning process. The entrapped AChE hydrolyzed paraoxon to produce p-nitrophenol within the hydrogel microstructure, which subsequently quenched the fluorescence of the QDs on the surface of Ag@Silica. The MEF-assisted fluorescence detection resulted in a significant enhancement of paraoxon detection. The detection limit was approximately 1.0 × 10-10 M and 2.0 × 10-7 M for sensing with and without MEF, respectively.

Conventional multiplex PCR is an effective methodology to simultaneously amplify different DNA targets. However, its multiplicity is limited due to the intrinsic interference and competition among primer pairs within one tube. Here, we present an easy multiplex PCR microchip system, which can simultaneously detect 54 targets. The design of the microchip is quite simple. There is a microchannel connected with multiple underlying parallel microwells. And every microchannel has an inlet/outlet for loading PCRmix. The surface of the microchannel is hydrophobic and the inner surface of the microwell is hydrophilic, which enables us to load and separate the PCRmix into different microwells simultaneously. Different primer pairs and low melting agarose are pre-fixed in different microwells, and the microchip is assembled with top glass. The PCRmix is loaded into inlets and then mineral oil is sequentially pipetted into channels to push the PCRmix into all microwells and subsequently mineral oil fills the channels to avoid cross contaminations. After the PCRmix is loaded, it would be placed on a plat thermal cycler for PCR. During PCR, the low melting gel in the well is liquid and after PCR it would be solidified due to temperature changes. When PCR is completed, a nucleic acid dye is introduced into channels and then results are visualized by a home-made, potable UV detector. In our platform we successfully detected seven frequently used targets of genetically modified (GM) organisms. The results demonstrate that our platform has high flexibility and specificity.

Microarrays and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) are the most commonly used high-throughput gene expression platforms for detecting differentially expressed genes between two (or more) phenotypes. Gene co-expression networks (GCNs) are a systems biology method for capturing transcriptional patterns and predicting gene interactions into functional and regulatory relationships. Here, we describe the procedures and tools used to construct and analyze GCN and investigate the integration of transcriptional data with GCN to provide reliable information about the underlying biological mechanism."

The gradual change of composition within the polymer gradients, consisting of two different monomers and a cross-linker, was validated by XPS and fluorescence analysis. Cellular screening of the gradients allowed the rapid identification of optimal polymer compositions for binding of the suspension cell line K562 and the adherent cell line HeLa. The polymers identified were identical to those identified by previous microarray data, providing proof of concept for the successful application of the polymer gradient arrays as a screening tool. In addition, the polymer gradients could be readily modified by conjugation enabling the generation of bio-molecule gradients."

However, silicone printheads are expensive and not able to be used as a disposable. Here, we show the development and functional characterization of 8-channel plastic microarray printheads that overcome both disadvantages of their conventional silicone counterparts. A combination of injection-molding and laser processing allows us to produce a high quantity of cheap, customizable and disposable microarray printheads. The use of plastics (e.g., polystyrene) minimizes the need for surface modifications required previously for proper printing results. Time-consuming regeneration processes, cleaning procedures and contaminations caused by residual samples are avoided. The utilization of plastic printheads for viscous liquids, such as cell suspensions or whole blood, is possible. Furthermore, functional parts within the plastic printhead (e.g., particle filters) can be included. Our printhead is compatible with commercially available TopSpot devices but provides additional economic and technical benefits as compared to conventional TopSpot printheads, while fulfilling all requirements demanded on the latter. All in all, this work describes how the field of traditional microarray spotting can be extended significantly by low cost plastic printheads."

The applications of the combined array are summarized in Figure 4. Standard aCGH is a rapid, sensitive, and high-throughput approach for CNV detection, and although central to many cytogenetic studies, approximately 80% of developmental disorder samples yield a normal result, highlighting the need for additional information. Incorporating SNP analysis into the aCGH array provides insight into the underlying genetic causes, while retaining the benefits of the well-established aCGH platform. In many cases this removes the need for time-consuming follow-up studies, and is particularly beneficial considering the costs and labor involved in a high-resolution SNP array. Due to the prevalence of ancestral ROH, it is clear that there is little additional benefit to analyzing ROH at high resolution, which adds to the complexity of the data, increasing the laboratory workload. The most effective combined aCGH and SNP arrays instead provide sufficient resolution to detect abnormally long ROH stretches present in UPD or consanguineous samples, while excluding standard length ancestral ROH that are not biologically relevant, without compromising CNV detection. his new generation of combined aCGH and SNP array presents a high-throughput and efficient alternative to high-resolution SNP platforms, incorporating SNP analysis into existing aCGH workflows, and yielding unique biological insights with minimal additional cost."

We focused on time series data since we are interested in the dynamics of GRNs and the identification of dynamic networks. We evaluated the amount of information that exists in artificial time series microarray data and the ability of an inference process to produce accurate models based on them. We used dynamic artificial gene regulatory networks in order to create artificial microarray data. Key features that characterize microarray data such as the time separation of directly triggered genes, the percentage of directly triggered genes and the triggering function type were altered in order to reveal the limits that are imposed by the nature of microarray data on the inference process. We examined the effect of various factors on the inference performance such as the network size, the presence of noise in microarray data, and the network sparseness. We used a system theory approach and examined the relationship between the pole placement of the inferred system and the inference performance. We examined the relationship between the inference performance in the time domain and the true system parameter identification. Simulation results indicated that time separation and the percentage of directly triggered genes are crucial factors. Also, network sparseness, the triggering function type and noise in input data affect the inference performance. When two factors were simultaneously varied, it was found that variation of one parameter significantly affects the dynamic response of the other. Crucial factors were also examined using a real GRN and acquired results confirmed simulation findings with artificial data. Different initial conditions were also used as an alternative triggering approach. Relevant results confirmed that the number of datasets constitutes the most significant parameter with regard to the inference performance."

This review focuses on the application of nanofabrication towards the nanoscale observing, patterning, sorting, and concentrating membrane components. Membranes on living cells are a necessary component of many fundamental cellular processes that naturally incorporate nanoscale rearrangement of the membrane lipids and proteins. Nanofabrication has advanced these understandings, for example, by providing 30 nm resolution of membrane proteins with metal-enhanced fluorescence at the tip of a scanning probe on fixed cells. Naturally diffusing single molecules at high concentrations on live cells have been observed at 60 nm resolution by confining the fluorescence excitation light through nanoscale metallic apertures. The lateral reorganization on the plasma membrane during membrane-mediated signaling processes has been examined in response to nanoscale variations in the patterning and mobility of the signal-triggering molecules. Further, membrane components have been separated, concentrated, and extracted through on-chip electrophoretic and microfluidic methods. Nanofabrication provides numerous methods for examining and manipulating membranes for both greater understandings of membrane processes as well as for the application of membranes to other biophysical methods."

The shift from cytotoxic chemotherapy to biomolecular therapeutics requires that efficacy is assessed at the biologically active dose that modulates the target, rather than using the conventional dose-toxicity relationship. In this context, functional cytomics is slowly becoming an omnipotent part of the post-genomic drug-discovery pipelines. Although, it is widely recognized in the drug-discovery arena that the validation of therapeutic targets revealed by proteomic and genetic screens requires functional cell-based assays, their widespread clinical applications are still underdeveloped. In this context, microfluidic cell array technologies provide important technological advances that allow for fundamentally new capabilities in the spatiotemporal control of molecules and cells. Pioneering lab-on-a-chip devices, such as microfluidic cell arrays, allow for a lucid integration of multiparameter data, obtained from functional cell-based assays, as well as from proteomic and genetic screening. They also offer opportunities for fabrication of parallelized and fully addressable perfusion microarrays aiming at greatly reduced equipment costs, simplified operation, increased sensitivity and throughput by implementing, for example, a parallel processing principle.

Genome-wide profiling of the human placental transcriptome provides an unbiased approach to study normal maternal-placental-foetal physiology and pathologies.\n    \n\n\n          Objective and rationale:\n        \n      \n      To date, many studies have examined the human placental transcriptome, but often within a narrow focus. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of human placental transcriptome studies, encompassing those from the cellular to tissue levels and contextualize current findings from a broader perspective. We have consolidated studies into overarching themes, summarized key research findings and addressed important considerations in study design, as a means to promote wider data sharing and support larger meta-analysis of already available data and greater collaboration between researchers in order to fully capitalize on the potential of transcript profiling in future studies.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      The PubMed database, National Center for Biotechnology Information and European Bioinformatics Institute dataset repositories were searched, to identify all relevant human studies using 'placenta', 'decidua', 'trophoblast', 'transcriptome', 'microarray' and 'RNA sequencing' as search terms until May 2019.

Transcriptome studies prior to 2015 were predominantly performed using microarrays, while RNA sequencing became the preferred choice in more recent studies. Development of fluidics technology, combined with RNA sequencing, has enabled transcript profiles to be generated of single cells throughout pregnancy, in contrast to previous studies relying on isolated cells. There are several key study aspects, such as sample selection criteria, sample processing and data analysis methods that may represent pitfalls and limitations, which need to be carefully considered as they influence interpretation of findings and conclusions.

Such understanding could help in predicting risk of future adversity and in designing interventions that can improve the health outcomes of both mothers and their offspring. Wider collaboration and sharing of placental transcriptome data, overcoming the challenges in obtaining sufficient numbers of quality samples with well-defined clinical characteristics, and dedication of resources to understudied areas of pregnancy will undoubtedly help drive the field forward."

However, ETV-related long-term outcome data are lacking for the adult hydrocephalus population. The objective of the present study was to assess the role of ETV as a primary or secondary treatment for hydrocephalus in adults. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective chart review of all adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with symptomatic hydrocephalus treated with ETV in Calgary, Canada, over a span of 20 years (1994-2014). Patients were dichotomized into a primary or secondary ETV cohort based on whether ETV was the initial treatment modality for the hydrocephalus or if other CSF diversion procedures had been previously attempted respectively. Primary outcomes were subjective patient-reported clinical improvement within 12 weeks of surgery and the need for any CSF diversion procedures after the initial ETV during the span of the study. Categorical and actuarial data analysis was done to compare the outcomes of the primary versus secondary ETV cohorts. RESULTS A total of 163 adult patients with symptomatic hydrocephalus treated with ETV were identified and followed over an average of 98.6 months (range 0.1-230.4 months). All patients presented with signs of intracranial hypertension or other neurological symptoms. The primary ETV group consisted of 112 patients, and the secondary ETV consisted of 51 patients who presented with failed ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. After the initial ETV procedure, clinical improvement was reported more frequently by patients in the primary cohort (87%) relative to those in the secondary ETV cohort (65%, p = 0.001). Additionally, patients in the primary ETV group required fewer reoperations (p < 0.001), with cumulative ETV survival time favoring this primary ETV cohort over the course of the follow-up period (p < 0.001). Fifteen patients required repeat ETV, with all but one experiencing successful relief of symptoms. Patients in the secondary ETV cohort also had a higher incidence of complications, with one occurring in 8 patients (16%) compared with 2 in the primary ETV group (2%; p = 0.010), although most complications were minor. CONCLUSIONS ETV is an effective long-term treatment for selected adult patients with hydrocephalus. The overall ETV success rate when it was the primary treatment modality for adult hydrocephalus was approximately 87%, and 99% of patients experience symptomatic improvement after 2 ETVs. Patients in whom VP shunt surgery fails prior to an ETV have a 22% relative risk of ETV failure and an almost eightfold complication rate, although mostly minor, when compared with patients who undergo a primary ETV. Most ETV failures occur within the first 7 months of surgery in patients treated with primary ETV, but the time to failure is more prolonged in patients who present with failed previous shunts."

Clinical phenotypes within L1 syndrome include X-linked hydrocephalus with stenosis of the aqueduct of sylvius (HSAS); mental retardation, adducted thumbs, shuffling gait, and aphasia (MASA) syndrome; spastic paraplegia type 1; and agenesis of the corpus callosum. Over 200 mutations in L1CAM have been reported; however, only a few large gene deletions have been observed. We report on a 4-month-old male with a de novo whole gene deletion of L1CAM presenting with congenital hydrocephalus, aqueductal stenosis, and adducted thumbs. Initial failure of L1CAM gene sequencing suggested the possibility of a whole gene deletion of L1CAM. Further investigation through chromosome microarray analysis showed a 62Kb deletion encompassing the first exon of the PDZD4 gene and the entire L1CAM gene. Investigations into genotype-phenotype correlations have suggested that mutations leading to truncated or absent L1 protein cause more severe forms of L1 syndrome. Based on the presentation of the proband and other reported patients with whole gene deletions, we provide further evidence that L1CAM whole gene deletions result in L1 syndrome with a severe phenotype, deletions of PDZD4 do not cause additional manifestations, and that X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus reported in a subset of patients with large L1CAM deletions results from the loss of AVPR2."

Nonetheless, in the majority of CH cases, the pathological etiology remains unknown, suggesting more genes await discovery.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      WES of family members of a sporadic and familial form of severe L1CAM mutation-negative CH associated with aqueductal stenosis was performed. Rare genetic variants were analyzed, prioritized, and validated. De novo copy number variants (CNVs) were identified using the XHMM algorithm and validated using qPCR. Xenopus oocyte experiments were performed to access mutation impact on protein function and expression.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A novel inherited protein-damaging mutation (p.Pro605Leu) in SLC12A6, encoding the K+ -Cl- cotransporter KCC3, was identified in both affected members of multiplex kindred CHYD110. p.Pro605 is conserved in KCC3 orthologs and among all human KCC paralogs. The p.Pro605Leu mutation maps to the ion-transporting domain, and significantly reduces KCC3-dependent K+ transport. A novel de novo CNV (deletion) was identified in SLC12A7, encoding the KCC3 paralog and binding partner KCC4, in another family (CHYD130) with sporadic CH.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These findings identify two novel, related genes associated with CH, and implicate genetically encoded impairments in ion transport for the first time in CH pathogenesis."

However, converting well-developed surface chemistry for spectroscopic measurements to array-based, high-throughput screening is not a trivial process and often proves to be the bottleneck in method development. This chapter reports the fabrication and characterization of a new carbohydrate microarray with synthetic sialosides for surface plasmon resonance imaging analysis of lectin-carbohydrate interactions. Contact printing of functional sialosides on neutravidin-coated surfaces was carried out and the properties of the resulting elements were characterized by fluorescence microscopy. Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) was used for testing on four different carbohydrate-functionalized surfaces and differential binding was analyzed. Multiplexed detection of SNA/biotinylated sialoside interactions on arrays up to 400 elements has been performed with good data correlation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the biotin-neutravidin-based biointerface to control probe orientation for reproducible and efficient protein binding to carbohydrates."

Fetal brain imaging and autopsy showed major ventriculomegaly, reduced brain mass, and with no histomorphologic abnormalities. We demonstrate that the binding of KIDINS220 to TrkA is diminished by the deletion mutation.

As a model system, different concentrations of glucose were detected using a fluorescence method by sequential bienzymatic reaction of hydrogel-entrapped glucose oxidase (GOX) and peroxidase (POD) inside a hydrogel microarray. Microarrays based on poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG) hydrogels were prepared by photopatterning a solution containing PEG diacrylate (PEG-DA), photoinitiator, enzymes, and Ag@SiO2. The resulting hydrogel microarrays were able to entrap both enzymes and Ag@SiO2 without leaching and deactivation problems. The presence of Ag@SiO2 within the hydrogel microarray enhanced the fluorescence signal, and the extent of the enhancement was dependent on the thickness of silica shells and the amount of Ag@SiO2. Optimal MEF effects were achieved when the thickness of the silica shell was 17.5 nm, and 0.5 mg mL(-1) of Ag@SiO2 was incorporated into the assay systems. Compared with the standard hydrogel microarray-based assay performed without Ag@SiO2, more than a 4-fold fluorescence enhancement was observed in a glucose concentration range between 10(-3) mM and 10.0 mM using hydrogel microarray entrapping Ag@SiO2, which led to significant improvements in the sensitivity and the limit of detection (LOD). The hydrogel microarray system presented in this study could be successfully combined with a microfluidic device as an initial step to create an MEF-based micro-total-analysis-system (μ-TAS)."

Unfortunately, the clinical implication of many copy number variants found on prenatal CMA is uncertain, complicating genetic counseling. Recognizing that uncertain results will be encountered frequently as more of the genome is assayed prenatally, we set out to understand the experiences and needs of genetic counselors when counseling patients about uncertain prenatal microarray results, their comfort with various aspects of prenatal genetic counseling, and their interest in additional education and training about prenatal microarray testing. We first interviewed 10 genetic counselors about their experiences of providing pre- and post-test genetic counseling about prenatal CMA. Based on the findings from the counselor interviews, we developed items for a survey to assess the prevalence of genetic counselors' attitudes towards, experience and comfort with, and educational needs regarding prenatal CMA. Based on surveys completed by 193 prenatal genetic counselors, we found that when there is an uncertain CMA result, only 59% would be comfortable providing genetic counseling and only 43% would be comfortable helping a patient make a decision about pregnancy termination. Being less comfortable was associated with seeing fewer patients having prenatal CMA testing. Respondents expressed a high degree of interest in additional education about prenatal CMA and counseling about uncertain results. Further genetic counselor education and training aimed at improving counselors' personal comfort with uncertain results and communicating about them with patients is needed."

The purpose of this document is to review the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of mild fetal ventriculomegaly. When enlargement of the lateral ventricles (≥10 mm) is identified, a thorough evaluation should be performed, including detailed sonographic evaluation of fetal anatomy, amniocentesis for karyotype and chromosomal microarray analysis, and a workup for fetal infection. In some cases, fetal magnetic resonance imaging may identify other central nervous system abnormalities and should be considered when this technology as well as expert interpretation is available. Follow-up ultrasound examination should be performed to assess for progression of the ventricular dilation. In the setting of isolated ventriculomegaly of 10-12 mm, the likelihood of survival with normal neurodevelopment is >90%. With moderate ventriculomegaly (13-15 mm), the likelihood of normal neurodevelopment is 75-93%. The following are Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: We suggest that ventriculomegaly be characterized as mild (10-12 mm), moderate (13-15 mm), or severe (>15 mm) for the purposes of patient counseling, given that the chance of an adverse outcome and potential for other abnormalities are higher when the ventricles measure 13-15 mm vs 10-12 mm (GRADE 2B); we recommend that diagnostic testing (amniocentesis) with chromosomal microarray analysis should be offered when ventriculomegaly is detected (GRADE 1B); we recommend testing for cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis when ventriculomegaly is detected, regardless of known exposure or symptoms (GRADE 1B); we suggest that magnetic resonance imaging be considered in cases of mild or moderate fetal ventriculomegaly when this modality and expert radiologic interpretation are available; magnetic resonance imaging is likely to be of less value if the patient has had a detailed ultrasound performed by an individual with specific experience and expertise in sonographic imaging of the fetal brain (GRADE 2B); we recommend that timing and mode of delivery be based on standard obstetric indications (GRADE 1C); we recommend that with isolated mild ventriculomegaly of 10-12 mm, after a complete evaluation, women be counseled that the outcome is favorable, and the infant is likely to be normal (GRADE 1B); we recommend that with isolated moderate ventriculomegaly of 13-15 mm, after a complete evaluation, women be counseled that the outcome is likely to be favorable but that there is an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disabilities (GRADE 1B)."

The microarrays consisted of pure nanocrystalline CdS with average crystallite size of about 10.7 nm. The photocurrent response and the optical adsorption of the patterned CdS microarray thin films increased with the decrease of the feature size, which was due to the increased CdS surface area, as well as the increased optical path length within the patterned CdS thin films, resulting from multiple reflection of incident light.

The array was printed in 16 subarrays to allow testing of several samples on each slide. Hybridizations with cDNA from plants infected with 52 different virus species showed that out of the 52 species tested, 49 were positive and identified correctly to species level. This array represents the largest published microarray for plant virus detection in terms of the number of targeted species and is thus an important milestone towards the construction of a generic microarray able to detect most, if not all, plant RNA viruses."

Further classification on levels of risk of SAB to high (>75%), intermediate (51%-75%), and low (26%-50%) for known chromosomal abnormalities, genomic disorders, and syndromic pCNVs could provide evidence-based interpretation in prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling."

Because structural heterogeneity is high in GAG chains and purification is difficult, the use of structurally defined GAG oligosaccharides from natural sources as molecular models in both biophysical and pharmacological assays is limited. To overcome this obstacle, GAG-like oligosaccharides of well-defined structures are currently being synthesized by chemical and/or enzymatic means in many research groups around the world. These synthetic GAG oligosaccharides serve as useful molecular tools in studies of GAG-protein interactions. In this review, besides discussing the commonest routes used for the synthesis of GAG oligosaccharides, we also survey some libraries of these synthetic models currently available for research and discuss their activities in interaction studies with functional proteins, especially through the microarray approach."

Little is known about the incidence and sensitivity of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) for detection of pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) comprising medically-actionable genes. Clinical CMA has been performed on 8865 individuals referred for molecular cytogenetic testing. We retrospectively reviewed the CMA results to identify patients with CNVs comprising genes included in the 59-ACMG list of secondary findings. We evaluated the clinical significance of these CNVs in respect to pathogenicity, phenotypic manifestations, and heritability. We identified 23 patients (0.26%) with relevant CNV either deletions comprising the entire gene or intragenic alterations involving one or more secondary findings genes. A number of patients and/or their family members with pathogenic CNVs manifest or expected to develop an anticipated clinical phenotype and would benefit from preventive management similar to the patients with pathogenic SNVs. To improve patients' care standardization should apply to reporting of both sequencing and CNVs obtained via clinical genome-wide analysis, including chromosomal microarray and exome/genome sequencing."

In this regard, the elucidation of the epigenetic process of DNA methylation, known to influence transcription by a differential occurrence in CpG islands in promoter regions, is increasingly gaining importance. However, DNA methylation has not yet been investigated on a genomic scale in CHO cells and suitable tools have not existed until now. Based on the genomic and transcriptomic CHO data currently available, we developed a customized oligonucleotide microarray covering 19598 CpG islands (89 % of total bioinformatically identified CpG islands) in the CHO genome. We applied our CHO-specific CpG island microarray to investigate the effect of butyrate treatment on differential DNA methylation in CHO cultures in a time-dependent approach. Supplementation of butyrate is known to enhance cell specific productivities in CHO cells and leads to alterations of epigenetic silencing events. Gene ontology clusters regarding, e.g., chromatin modification or DNA repair, were significantly overrepresented 24 h after butyrate addition. Functional classifications furthermore indicated that several major signaling systems such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway were affected by butyrate treatment. Our novel CHO-specific CpG island microarray will provide valuable information in future studies of cellular processes associated with productivity and product characteristics."

The prenatal consultation consisted in discussing the prognosis of ventriculomegaly, according to the literature.

We demonstrate that though extracted DNA concentrations varied across dust samples, the majority produced sufficient 16S rRNA to be profiled by the array. Comparison of array and 454-pyrosequencing performed in parallel on a subset of samples, illustrated that increasingly deeper sequencing efforts validated greater numbers of array-detected taxa. Community composition agreement across samples exhibited a hierarchy in concordance, with the highest level of agreement in replicate array profiles followed by samples collected from adjacent 1×1 m(2) sites in the same room, adjacent sites with different sized sampling quadrants (1×1 and 2×2 m(2)), different sites within homes (living and bedroom) to lowest in living room samples collected from different homes.

More precisely, our approach firstly finds the local density regions and subsequently merges the density connected regions to form the meaningful clusters. This idea empowers the clustering procedure, in which outliers are automatically detected, higher dense regions are intuitively determined and merged to form clusters of arbitrary shape, and clusters are identified regardless the dimensionality of space in which they are embedded.

Among these four methods, LR and Loess regression methods use all available genes to estimate either a linear or nonlinear normalization function, while IR and INR methods feature some iterative processes to identify invariantly expressed genes (IEGs) for nonlinear normalization. We tested these normalization approaches on three real microarray data sets and evaluated their performances in terms of variance reduction and fold-change preservation. By comparison, we found that (1) LR method exhibited the worst performance in both variance reduction and fold-change preservation, and (2) INR method showed an improved performance in achieving low expression variance across replicates and excellent fold-change preservation for differentially expressed genes."

These DNA modules were encoded so the recognition sequences would uniquely associate through Watson-Crick assembly to form closed-cycle or linear arrays of aligned SNS monomers. The melting behavior and electrophoretic migration of these assemblies showed cooperative formation of multicomponent arrays containing two to five DNA modules (i.e., 12-30 SNS monomers). The treatment of these arrays with horseradish peroxidase and H(2)O(2) resulted in oxidative polymerization of the SNS monomers with concomitant ligation of the DNA modules. The resulting cyclic and linear arrays exhibited chemical and optical properties typical of conducting thiophene-like polymers, with a red-end absorption beyond 1250 nm.

Efficient spike sorters must be developed to cope with such large data volumes. Most existing spike sorting methods for single electrodes or small multielectrodes, however, suffer from the \"curse of dimensionality\" and cannot be directly applied to recordings with hundreds of electrodes. This holds particularly true for the standard reference spike sorting algorithm, principal component analysis-based feature extraction, followed by k-means or expectation maximization clustering, against which most spike sorters are evaluated. We present a spike sorting algorithm that circumvents the dimensionality problem by sorting local groups of electrodes independently with classical spike sorting approaches. It is scalable to any number of recording electrodes and well suited for parallel computing. The combination of data prewhitening before the principal component analysis-based extraction and a parameter-free clustering algorithm obviated the need for parameter adjustments. We evaluated its performance using surrogate data in which we systematically varied spike amplitudes and spike rates and that were generated by inserting template spikes into the voltage traces of real recordings. In a direct comparison, our algorithm could compete with existing state-of-the-art spike sorters in terms of sensitivity and precision, while parameter adjustment or manual cluster curation was not required. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We present an automatic spike sorting algorithm that combines three strategies to scale classical spike sorting techniques for high-density microelectrode arrays: 1) splitting the recording electrodes into small groups and sorting them independently; 2) clustering a subset of spikes and classifying the rest to limit computation time; and 3) prewhitening the spike waveforms to enable the use of parameter-free clustering.

Accompanied by a deregulated glycolysis is an increasing dependence on glucose and glutamine, this characteristic offers a striking opportunity for new kinds of anti-cancer drugs.

However, each data entry may reflect trivial individual differences among samples and also contain technical noise. Therefore, the certainty of each observed difference should be confirmed at earlier steps of the analyses, and statistical tests are frequently used for this purpose. Since microarrays analyze a huge number of genes simultaneously, concerns of multiplicity, i.e. the family wise error rate (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR), have been raised in testing the data. To deal with these concerns, several compensation methodologies have been proposed, making the tests very conservative to the extent that arbitrary tuning of the threshold has been introduced to relax the conditions. Unexpectedly, however, the appropriateness of the test methodologies, the concerns of multiplicity, and the compensation methodologies have not been sufficiently confirmed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The appropriateness was checked by means of coincidence between the methodologies' premises and the statistical characteristics of data found in two typical microarray platforms. As expected, normality was observed in within-group data differences, supporting application of t-test and F-test statistics. However, genes displayed their own tendencies in the magnitude of variations, and the distributions of p-values were rather complex. These characteristics are inconsistent with premises underlying the compensation methodologies, which assume that most of the null hypotheses are true. The evidence also raised concerns about multiplicity. In transcriptomic studies, FWER should not be critical, as analyses at higher levels would not be influenced by a few false positives. Additionally, the concerns for FDR are not suitable for the sharp null hypotheses on expression levels.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Therefore, although compensation methods have been recommended to deal with the problem of multiplicity, the compensations are actually inappropriate for transcriptome analyses.

However, the diversity of platforms has made it a challenge to re-use and/or integrate datasets generated in different experiments or labs for constructing array-based diagnostic models. Using large toxicogenomics datasets generated using both Affymetrix and Agilent microarray platforms, we carried out a benchmark evaluation of cross-platform consistency in multiple-class prediction using three widely-used machine learning algorithms. After an initial assessment of model performance on different platforms, we evaluated whether predictive signature features selected in one platform could be directly used to train a model in the other platform and whether predictive models trained using data from one platform could predict datasets profiled using the other platform with comparable performance. Our results established that it is possible to successfully apply multiple-class prediction models across different commercial microarray platforms, offering a number of important benefits such as accelerating the possible translation of biomarkers identified with microarrays to clinically-validated assays. However, this investigation focuses on a technical platform comparison and is actually only the beginning of exploring cross-platform consistency. Further studies are needed to confirm the feasibility of microarray-based cross-platform prediction, especially using independent datasets."

Plants use polysaccharides for support, defense, signaling, cell adhesion, and as energy storage, and many plant glycans are also important industrially and nutritionally. Understanding the biological roles of plant glycans and the effective exploitation of their useful properties requires a detailed understanding of their structures, occurrence, and molecular interactions. Microarray technology has revolutionized the massively high-throughput analysis of nucleotides, proteins, and increasingly carbohydrates. Using microarrays, the abundance of and interactions between hundreds and thousands of molecules can be assessed simultaneously using very small amounts of analytes. Here we show that carbohydrate microarrays are multifunctional tools for plant research and can be used to map glycan populations across large numbers of samples to screen antibodies, carbohydrate binding proteins, and carbohydrate binding modules and to investigate enzyme activities."

We therefore sought to achieve comprehensive detection of microbial populations in wounds using novel genomic technologies and bioinformatics analyses. We employed a microarray capable of detecting all sequenced pathogens for interrogation of 124 wound samples from extremity injuries in combat-injured U.S. service members. A subset of samples was also processed via next-generation sequencing and metagenomic analysis. Array analysis detected microbial targets in 51% of all wound samples, with Acinetobacter baumannii being the most frequently detected species. Multiple Pseudomonas species were also detected in tissue biopsy specimens. Detection of the Acinetobacter plasmid pRAY correlated significantly with wound failure, while detection of enteric-associated bacteria was associated significantly with successful healing. Whole-genome sequencing revealed broad microbial biodiversity between samples. The total wound bioburden did not associate significantly with wound outcome, although temporal shifts were observed over the course of treatment. Given that standard microbiological methods do not detect the full range of microbes in each wound, these data emphasize the importance of supplementation with molecular techniques for thorough characterization of wound-associated microbes. Future application of genomic protocols for assessing microbial content could allow application of specialized care through early and rapid identification and management of critical patterns in wound bioburden."

A mixed solution of small interfering RNA (siRNA) and a transfection reagent was spotted on PEG-oleyl-coated glass slides using an ink-jet printer, and the cells were then transiently immobilized on the patterned transfection mixtures. After overlaying an ECM hydrogel sheet onto the immobilized cells, the cells sandwiched between the glass slide and the hydrogel sheet were incubated at 37°C for simultaneous transfection of siRNA into cells and adhesion of cells to the hydrogel sheet. Transfer of the adhered, transfected cells was completed by peeling off the hydrogel sheet. The knockdown of a model gene in the transferred cell microarray by the transfected siRNA was successfully confirmed. Transfected cell microarrays were also embedded within three-dimensional ECM hydrogels. In the three-dimensional hydrogel, the inhibition effect of siRNA on cancer cell invasion was evaluated by quantifying the size of cell clusters on the microarrays. These results indicate that transfection of cell microarrays on or in a biological matrix is a promising technique for high-throughput screening of disease-related genes by direct observation of cellular phenomena in a physiologically relevant environment."

An understanding of hemagglutinin (HA) receptor-binding specificity to host receptors is key to studying the adaptation of influenza viruses in humans. This information may be particularly useful for predicting the emergence of a pandemic outbreak. Therefore, high-throughput sensing technologies able to profile HA receptor binding can facilitate studies of influenza virus evolution and adaptation in humans. As a step toward this goal, we have prepared glycan-based receptor analogue microarrays on the Arrayed Imaging Reflectometry (AIR) platform. These arrays demonstrate label-free, multiplex detection and discrimination between human and avian influenza viruses. Microarrays consisting of glycan probes with 2,6 and 2,3 linkages were prepared. After first confirming their ability to capture lectins (carbohydrate-binding proteins) with known specificities, we observed that the arrays were able to discriminate between and quantify human pandemic influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm) and avian A/Netherlands/1/2000 (H13N8) influenza viruses, respectively. As the method may be expanded to large numbers of glycans (>100) and virus subtypes (H1-H18), we anticipate it can be applied to systematically evaluate influenza virus adaptation in humans. In turn, this will facilitate global influenza surveillance and serve as a new tool enabling health organizations, governments, research institutes, and laboratories to react quickly in the face of a pandemic outbreak."

Photolithographic thin layer technology allows the fabrication of sensors of micrometric dimensions separated with a very small gap. This fact allows the diffusion layers of single microelectrodes to overlap as members of the array. Various basic types of microelectrode arrays with interacting diffusion layers are described and their analytical abilities are accented. Theoretical approaches to diffusion layer overlapping and the consequences of close constitution effects such as collection efficiency and redox cycling are discussed. Examples of basis applications in electroanalytical chemistry such as amperometric detectors in HPLC and substitutional stripping voltammetry are also given."

The present study monitored clot formation in a microchip-based light transmission aggregometer. Citrated blood samples with and without the addition of calcium ion solution were initially disaggregated by rotating a stirrer in the microchip. After abrupt stop of the rotating stirrer, the transmitted light intensity over time was recorded. The syllectogram (light intensity vs. time graph) manifested a rapid increase that is associated with RBC aggregation followed by a decrease that is associated with blood coagulation. The time to reach the peak point was used as a new index of coagulation time (CT) and ranged from 200 to 500 seconds in the present measurements. The CT was inversely proportional to the concentration of fibrinogen, which enhances RBC aggregation. In addition, the CT was inversely proportional to the hematocrit, which is similar to the case of the prothrombin time (PT), as measured by a commercial coagulometer. Thus, we carefully concluded that RBC aggregation should be considered in tests of blood coagulation."

In order for the results of the trio study to be valid, the mother and father must be the true biological parents of the proband. As such, non-paternity and sample mix-ups are potential sources of error. To address these potential issues, we developed a computer script to accurately assess maternity and paternity using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data generated by Agilent chromosomal microarrays, a platform-of-choice for clinical copy number testing.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We assessed the performance of the script on 10 putative trios tested at our laboratory, and found that the numbers and proportions of discordant SNPs were useful for determining parental relationships.

Microarray Polymer Profiling identified xylan, arabinoxylan, mixed-linkage glucan and mannan as target substrates for the enzymatic cleaning of BoBo residues from surfaces. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that burning resulted in extensive structural modifications and degradation of the three-dimensional architecture of constituent polysaccharide matrices.

The sample populations included 116 normal fetuses and 66 fetuses with primary (n = 56) or post-hemorrhagic (n = 10) ventriculomegaly. In all cases, the atrial width (AW) was measured according to standard protocols and the findings were compared with four sonographic indices developed in the neonate: the anterior horn width (AHW), the ventricular index (VI), the thalamo-occipital distance (TOD) and the fronto-occipital horn ratio (FOHR).

Such microchip employs two pairs of piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) for acoustic field generation and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microcavity on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate for producing microparticle array. The applying of acoustic field results in rapidly forming microparticle array by adjusting the inputting frequency and voltage. In-situ modification and detection are accelerated due to the dynamic ultrasonic streaming around the ultrasound induced microparticle array. Such array also benefits from reducing the detection errors by coupling of multiple points. With this strategy, biomarkers (e.g. miRNA) can be enriched, and achieve in-situ modification and detection via simple two steps with excellent specificity. After the detection, samples are regained from the output channel by releasing the acoustic field, which is benefit for further analysis. Such integrated modification and detection acoustic microchip shows great potential in visual in-situ analysis and enriching ultratrace biomarkers for clinical diagnosis."

DWM is associated with a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental abnormalities such as cognitive, motor, and behavioral impairments, which cannot be explained solely by cerebellar malformations. Notably, the pathogenesis of these symptoms remains poorly understood. This study investigated whether fetal structural developmental abnormalities in DWM extended beyond the posterior fossa to the cerebrum even in fetuses without apparent cerebral anomalies. Post-acquisition volumetric fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis was performed in 12 fetuses with DWM and 14 control fetuses. Growth trajectories of the volumes of the cortical plate, subcortical parenchyma, cerebellar hemispheres, and vermis between 18 and 33 weeks of gestation were compared. The median (interquartile range) gestational ages at the time of MRI were 22.4 (19.4-24.0) and 23.9 (20.6-29.2) weeks in the DWM and control groups, respectively (p = 0.269). Eight of the 12 fetuses with DWM presented with associated cerebral anomalies, including hydrocephalus (n = 3), cerebral ventriculomegaly (n = 3), and complete (n = 2) and partial (n = 2) agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC); 7 presented with extracerebral abnormalities. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected by microarray analysis in 4 of 11 fetuses with DWM, using amniocentesis. Volumetric analysis revealed that the cortical plate was significantly larger in fetuses with DWM than in controls (p = 0.040). Even without ACC, the subcortical parenchyma, whole cerebrum, cerebellar hemispheres, and whole brain were significantly larger in fetuses with DWM (n = 8) than in controls (p = 0.004, 0.025, 0.033, and 0.026, respectively). In conclusion, volumetric fetal MRI analysis demonstrated that the development of DWM extends throughout the brain during the fetal period, even without apparent cerebral anomalies."

Its diagnosis remains primarily clinical and radiological. Identification of its causative variants will assist genetic counseling. We aim to describe genetic and neuroimaging findings of WWS and investigate the correlation between them.\n## METHODS\nWe retrospectively reviewed the clinical, genetic and neuroimaging findings of eleven Saudi neonates diagnosed with WWS between April 2012 and December 2018 in a single tertiary care center. Correlation between neuroimaging and genetic findings was investigated.\n## RESULTS\nAll patients had macrocephaly except one who had intrauterine growth restriction. Dysmorphic features were identified in nearly half of the patients. Creatine kinase levels were available in nine patients and were always elevated. Homozygous pathogenic variants were identified in all patients spanning POMT1 (n = 5), TMEM5 (n = 3), ISPD (n = 2) and POMT2 (n = 1) including one patient who had a dual molecular diagnosis of ISPD and PGAP2.

Other cerebral cortical malformations included subependymal heterotopia, polymicrogyria and open-lip schizencephaly in four, two and one patients, respectively. Buphthalmos and microphthalmia were the most prevalent orbital findings and found in all patients either unilaterally or bilaterally.\n## CONCLUSION\nWWS is a genetically heterogeneous disorder among Saudis. The case with an additional PGAP2-related phenotype exemplifies the increased risk of dual autosomal recessive disorders in consanguineous populations.

            "abstract": "Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) defined by the cessation of ovarian function before the age of 40 years and the increase of gonadotropins (> 25 UI/l) occurs in approximately 1-5% of women. Different mechanisms are responsible for POI: chemotherapy, radiotherapy, environmental factors or genetic causes but most frequently no cause is identified. In order to determine the etiology of POI, cytogenetic analyses such as karyotype are performed. The karyotype allows to identify abnormalities of the number of chromosomes as well as abnormalities of the structure such as translocations, deletions or insertions of a size greater than 5-10 Mb… Turner syndrome is the most frequent genetic cause of POI and deletions of the long arm of the X chromosome are other causes of POI identified by the karyotype. However, the resolution of the karyotype is low and other cytogenetic techniques were developed such as all genome microarray analysis. This technique includes CGH-array and SNP-array and allows to identify gain or loss of chromosomal material as small as 10 kb but not the balanced structural rearrangements. Different studies using microarray analysis in cohorts of patients presenting with POI identify candidate genes responsible for POI. Furthermore, they allowed to identify a recurrent microdeletion, which includes the CPEB1 gene, located in 15q25.2 in about 1.5% of patients with POI."

            "abstract": "Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is recommended as a first tier investigation for patients with developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID), autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), and multiple congenital anomalies (MCA). It is widely used in the prenatal and postnatal settings for detection of chromosomal aberrations. This is a retrospective review of all array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH/ array CGH) findings ascertained in two major prenatal and postnatal genetic diagnostic centers in Hong Kong from June 2012 to December 2017. Medical records were reviewed for cases with pathogenic and variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS). Classification of copy number variants (CNVs) was based on current knowledge and experience by August 2018. The aims of this review are to study the diagnostic yield of array CGH application in prenatal and postnatal settings in Hong Kong and to describe the spectrum of abnormalities found. Prenatal indications included abnormal ultrasound findings, positive Down syndrome screening, abnormal noninvasive prenatal test results, advanced maternal age and family history of chromosomal or genetic abnormalities. Postnatal indications included unexplained DD, ID, ASD, and MCA. A total of 1,261 prenatal subjects and 3,096 postnatal patients were reviewed. The prenatal diagnostic yield of pathogenic CNV and VUS (excluding those detectable by karyotype) was 3.5%. The postnatal diagnostic yield of pathogenic CNV was 15.2%. The detection rates for well-defined microdeletion and microduplication syndromes were 4.6% in prenatal and 6.1% (1 in 16 index patients) in postnatal cases, respectively. Chromosomes 15, 16, and 22 accounted for over 21 and 25% of pathogenic CNVs detected in prenatal and postnatal cohorts, respectively. This review provides the first large scale overview of genomic imbalance of mostly Chinese patients in prenatal and postnatal settings."

According to the degree of enlargement of the ventricles, VM was divided into three groups: mild, moderate and severe. Moreover fetuses with isolated VM were separated from those with additional abnormalities. According to the KANET, fetuses with scores ≥ 14 were considered normal, those with scores 6-13 borderline and abnormal if the score was ≤ 5.

Referred to as \"in-plane parallel scanning\" (IPPS), this technology replaces expensive laser scanning with a grid of 100-μm-wide waveguides embedded in the chip's substrate, enabling real-time quantification of molecular complex formation on the chip's surface. Compared to conventional microarray technology, IPPS has advantages of shorter assay time and lower instrument cost and complexity so that the platform can potentially be used in point-of-care (POC) settings. Two different chip formats are described: a low-density microarray with 10 sensing wells (IPPS-10) and a medium-density one with 100 sensing wells (IPPS-100). Performance was evaluated in two different proof-of-principle immunoassays: interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and Clostridium difficile toxin A. The two assays gave similar limits of detection of 0.67 and 0.94 pM, respectively. A saturation kinetics model described the sensor response with apparent dissociation constants of 511 pM for IL-1β and 6.47 nM for C. difficile toxin A toxoid. The multiplexing capabilities of the IPPS technology were also demonstrated in a multiplex assay for both analytes on the same IPPS-10 chip. Based on these results, the IPPS technology holds promise for translating diagnostic microarrays into near-patient environments."

Electronic readout of large panels of markers has been hampered by the difficulty of addressing large arrays of electrode-based sensors on inexpensive platforms. Here we report a new concept--solution-based circuits formed on chip--that makes highly multiplexed electrochemical sensing feasible on passive chips. The solution-based circuits switch the information-carrying signal readout channels and eliminate all measurable crosstalk from adjacent, biomolecule-specific microsensors. We build chips that feature this advance and prove that they analyse unpurified samples successfully, and accurately classify pathogens at clinically relevant concentrations. We also show that signature molecules can be accurately read 2 minutes after sample introduction."

            "abstract": "Microarray technologies have received considerable attention owing to the fact that they serve as powerful tools for the high-throughput analysis of biomolecular interactions and the identification of bioactive substances that bind to biomolecules. Most of the current methods used to construct microarrays rely on the immobilization of substances on properly derivatized surfaces. Among various functional groups used for this purpose, the N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester group has been largely employed because it can be readily reacted with amine or hydrazide functionalities in substances of interest. However, the NHS ester group is usually introduced onto the surface of a glass slide by employing inconvenient and time-consuming multistep processes. In recent studies, we have developed an efficient, single step method for derivatization of glass surfaces with NHS ester groups that takes advantage of an acid-mediated reaction of NHS ester functionalized dimethallylsilanes with silanols on the glass surface. Conditions for the surface modification procedure that utilize TfOH rather than Sc(OTf)(3) were found to be superior. Protein and RNA-binding experiments show that glass surfaces modified by employing this method are suitable for efficient immobilization of various substances that are appended by amine, hydrazide, and alcohol functionalities. The microarrays, generated in this way, are applicable to procedures for rapid analysis of protein-protein, protein-glycan, protein-small molecule, and peptide-RNA interactions, as well as for profiling enzyme activities. The newly developed acid-mediated, glass surface modification method should be generally applicable to the preparation of various functional group-modified surfaces."

The usefulness of ImmunoCAP ISAC has been validated in a wide spectrum of allergic diseases like asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, food allergy and anaphylaxis. ISAC provides a broad picture of a patient's sensitization profile from a single test, and provides information on specific and cross-reactive sensitizations that facilitate diagnosis, risk assessment, and disease management. Furthermore, it can reveal unexpected sensitizations which may explain anaphylaxis previously categorized as idiopathic and also display for the moment clinically non-relevant sensitizations. ISAC can facilitate a better selection of relevant allergens for immunotherapy compared with extract testing. Microarray technique can visualize the allergic march and molecular spreading in the preclinical stages of allergic diseases, and may indicate that the likelihood of developing symptomatic allergy is associated with specific profiles of sensitization to allergen components. ISAC is shown to be a useful tool in routine allergy diagnostics due to its ability to improve risk assessment, to better select relevant allergens for immunotherapy as well as detecting unknown sensitization.

We have developed the THEME (Tsing Hua Engine of Microarray Experiment) that exploits all necessary data analysis tools for loop-design microarray studies. THEME allows users to construct linear models and to apply multiple user-defined statistical tests of hypotheses for detection of DEG (differentially expressed genes). Users can modify entries of design matrix for experimental design as well as that of contrast matrix for statistical tests of hypotheses. The output of multiple user-defined statistical tests of hypotheses, DEG lists, can be cross-validated. The web platform provides data assessment and visualization tools that significantly assist users when evaluating the performance of microarray experimental procedures. THEME is also a MIAME (Minimal Information About a Microarray Experiment) compliant system, which enables users to export formatted files for GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) submission. THEME offers comprehensive web services to biologists for data analysis of loop-design microarray experiments.

            "abstract": "The expression microarray is a frequently used approach to study gene expression on a genome-wide scale. However, the data produced by the thousands of microarray studies published annually are confounded by \"batch effects,\" the systematic error introduced when samples are processed in multiple batches. Although batch effects can be reduced by careful experimental design, they cannot be eliminated unless the whole study is done in a single batch. A number of programs are now available to adjust microarray data for batch effects prior to analysis. We systematically evaluated six of these programs using multiple measures of precision, accuracy and overall performance. ComBat, an Empirical Bayes method, outperformed the other five programs by most metrics. We also showed that it is essential to standardize expression data at the probe level when testing for correlation of expression profiles, due to a sizeable probe effect in microarray data that can inflate the correlation among replicates and unrelated samples."

In the absence of accurate markers, MPM can be difficult to distinguish from peripheral lung adenocarcinoma and metastatic epithelial cancers. MicroRNA expression is tissue-specific and highly informative for identifying tumor origin. We identified microRNA biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of MPM and developed a standardized microRNA-based assay. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of 33 MPM and 210 carcinomas were used for assay development. Using microarrays, we identified microRNAs differentially expressed between MPM and various carcinomas. Hsa-miR-193-3p was overexpressed in MPM, while hsa-miR-200c and hsa-miR-192 were overexpressed in peripheral lung adenocarcinoma and carcinomas that frequently metastasize to lung pleura. We developed a standardized diagnostic assay based on the expression of these microRNAs. The assay reached a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 94% in a blinded validation set of 68 samples from the lung and pleura. This diagnostic assay can provide a useful tool in the differential diagnosis of MPM from other malignancies in the pleura."

A microbial diagnostic microarray for the detection of the most relevant bacterial food- and waterborne pathogens and indicator organisms was developed and thoroughly validated. The microarray platform based on sequence-specific end labeling of oligonucleotides and the phylogenetically robust gyrB marker gene allowed a highly specific (resolution on genus and/or species level) and sensitive (0.1% relative and 10(4) CFU absolute sensitivity) detection of the target pathogens.

In this study, we compared the diagnostic yield of exome sequencing (ES) and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) in fetuses with a major CNS anomaly.\n## METHODS\nThis was a retrospective study of 114 cases referred for genetic evaluation following termination of pregnancy (TOP) due to a major CNS anomaly detected on prenatal ultrasound. All fetuses were first analyzed by CMA. All CMA-negative cases were offered ES. CMA-positive cases were reanalyzed using ES to assess its ability to detect copy-number variants (CNVs).\n## RESULTS\nCMA identified a pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) CNV in 11/114 (10%) cases. Eighty-six CMA-negative cases were analyzed using ES, which detected P/LP sequence variants in 38/86 (44%). Among recurrent cases (i.e. cases with a previously affected pregnancy), the incidence of P/LP sequence variants was non-significantly higher compared with non-recurrent ones (12/19 (63%) vs 26/67 (39%); P = 0.06). Among the 38 cases with an ES diagnosis, 20 (53%) were inherited and carried a significant risk of recurrence. Reanalysis of 10 CMA-positive cases by ES demonstrated that the bioinformatics pipeline used for sequence variant analysis also detected all P/LP CNVs, as well as three previously known non-causative CNVs.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn our study, ES provided a high diagnostic yield (> 50%) in fetuses with severe CNS structural anomalies, which may have been partly due to the highly selected case series that included post-TOP cases from a specialist referral center. These data suggest that ES may be considered as a first-tier test for the prenatal diagnosis of major fetal CNS anomalies, detecting both P/LP sequence variants and CNVs. This is of particular importance given the time constraints of an ongoing pregnancy and the risk of recurrence in future pregnancies. © 2022 The Authors.

The aspect ratio (AR) of the nanocones can be finely modulated ranging from 1 to 6 by regulating the etching time. The samples with the AR value of 6 can present underwater superoleophobicity with the underwater oil contact angle (OCA) of 171.8°. The as-prepared PET nanocone arrays perform anti-bioadhesion behavior, which inhibits the formation of the actin cytoskeleton when it used as the substrate for cell culture. Moreover, the oil wettability is temperature controlled after modifying the PET nanocone arrays with PNIPAAm film, and the oil wettability of the functionalized nanocone arrays can be transformed from the superoleophobic state with OCA about 151° to the oleophilic state with OCA about 25° reversibly. Due to the high-throughput, parallel fabrication and cost-efficiency of this method, it will be favourable for researchers to introduce oleophobic properties to various substrate and device surfaces. Due to the superoleophobicity and simple functionalizing properties, the PET nanocone arrays are very promising surfaces for anti-adhesion, self-cleaning and have potential applications in material, medical, and biological fields."

Antibody-based proteomics by means of suspension bead arrays offers one attractive approach to analyze serum, plasma, or CSF samples for such studies in microtiter plates. To expand measurements beyond single batches, with either 96 or 384 samples per plate, suitable normalization methods are required to minimize the variation between plates. Here we propose two normalization approaches utilizing MA coordinates. The multidimensional MA (multi-MA) and MA-loess both consider all samples of a microtiter plate per suspension bead array assay and thus do not require any external reference samples. We demonstrate the performance of the two MA normalization methods with data obtained from the analysis of 384 samples including both serum and plasma. Samples were randomized across 96-well sample plates, processed, and analyzed in assay plates, respectively. Using principal component analysis (PCA), we could show that plate-wise clusters found in the first two components were eliminated by multi-MA normalization as compared with other normalization methods. Furthermore, we studied the correlation profiles between random pairs of antibodies and found that both MA normalization methods substantially reduced the inflated correlation introduced by plate effects. Normalization approaches using multi-MA and MA-loess minimized batch effects arising from the analysis of several assay plates with antibody suspension bead arrays. In a simulated biomarker study, multi-MA restored associations lost due to plate effects. Our normalization approaches, which are available as R package MDimNormn, could also be useful in studies using other types of high-throughput assay data."

RAPIDOMICS was a trio-based rapid ES pilot study of 25 babies with suspected genetic disorders in the BC Women's Hospital NICU. ES and bioinformatic analysis were performed after careful patient ascertainment. Trio analysis was performed using an in-house pipeline reporting variants in known disease-causing genes. Variants interpreted by the research team as definitely or possibly causal of the infant's phenotype were Sanger validated in a clinical laboratory. The average time to preliminary diagnosis was 7.2 days. Sanger validation was pursued in 15 patients for 13 autosomal dominant and 2 autosomal recessive disorders, with an overall diagnostic rate (partial or complete) of 60%.Conclusion: In total, 72% of patients enrolled had a genomic diagnosis achieved through ES, multi-gene panel testing or chromosomal microarray analysis. Among these, there was an 83% rate of significant and immediate impact on medical decision-making directly related to new knowledge of the diagnosis. Health service implementation challenges and successes are discussed.

Fetal growth restriction was defined as an estimated fetal weight of <tenth percentile for gestational age identified in ultrasound reports. For this analysis, we selected fetuses who underwent invasive genetic testing with karyotype and chromosomal microarray analysis results. Data were obtained from medical records and ultrasound databases and postmortem and placental examination reports in case of spontaneous stillbirths and terminations of pregnancy. Following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines, copy number variants were classified into 5 groups as following: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, variant of unknown significance, likely benign, and benign.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 682 referred fetuses diagnosed with isolated fetal growth restriction, both karyotype and chromosomal microarray analysis were performed in 146 fetuses.

Among the 139 fetuses with normal karyotype, 5 were detected with pathogenic and likely pathogenic copy number variants, resulting in an incremental yield of 3.6% (95% confidence interval, 0.5-6.6) in chromosomal microarray analysis compared with karyotype. All fetuses detected with pathogenic or likely pathogenic copy number variants resulted in terminations of pregnancy. In addition, 3 fetuses with normal karyotype were detected with a variant of unknown significance (2.1%).

For many microarrays, several biomolecular interactions occur simultaneously and the interplay of various factors that affect these interactions remains poorly understood. Detecting such interactions with a single technique can often be a difficult and complicated process. In this work we propose a combined technique which enables simultaneous angle-interrogation surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing and hyperspectral fluorescence imaging. This tandem technique offers two-dimensional imaging of the whole array plane. The refractive index information obtained from SPR sensing and the physicochemical properties obtained from fluorescence imaging provide a comprehensive analysis of biological events on the array-chip. In addition, SPR and fluorescence detection techniques confirm each other in experimental results to exclude false-positive or false-negative cases. In terms of SPR sensing performance, the refractive index resolution is 3.86×10(-6) refractive index units (RIU), and the detection limit is 10(4) cfu/ml of Escherichia coli bacteria. The resolving power and detection sensitivity of fluorescence imaging are approximately 20 μm and 0.61 fluors/μm(2), respectively. Finally, two model experiments, detecting the DNA hybridization and biotin-avidin interactions respectively, demonstrate the biomedical application of this system."

Bacterial adhesion was imaged under darkfield conditions with Fourier analysis, supporting a label-free method of pathogen detection. Hemin microarrays were screened against a panel of 16 bacteria and found capable of capturing multiple species, some with limits of detection as low as 10(3) cfu/mL. Several Gram-positive strains including Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis also exhibited rapid adhesion, enabling pattern recognition within minutes of exposure. This can be attributed to differences in hemin acquisition systems: aggressively adherent bacteria express cell-surface hemin receptors (CSHRs) that enable direct hemin binding and uptake, whereas other types of bacteria including most Gram-negative strains rely on the secretion and recapture of soluble proteins (hemophores) for hemin acquisition, with consequently longer times for ligand binding and detection."

Numerous methods of measuring RNA abundance exist, including northern blotting, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. However, these techniques might be used to assess the expression levels of only 10-50 genes at time. Today, DNA microarrays provide us with opportunity to simultaneously analyze tens of thousands of genes, giving a remarkable possibility to investigate the genomic contribution to cardiovascular diseases. A particular tissue at any stage of health or disease may be used to generate a genomic profile. Microarray techniques are already used in infectious diseases, oncology, and pharmacology to facilitate clinicians, risk-stratify patients, as well as to predict and assess therapeutic responses to drugs. In this paper, we describe recent advances in the use of various types of microarray technique in the diagnosis of arrhythmogenic heart disease.

Although many studies have noted potential sources of heterogeneity in genomic studies, to our knowledge none have systematically investigated their intertwined impacts on prediction accuracy across studies. We employ a hybrid parametric/non-parametric bootstrap method to realistically simulate publicly available compendia of microarray, RNA-seq, and whole metagenome shotgun microbiome studies of health outcomes. Three types of heterogeneity between studies are manipulated and studied: (i) imbalances in the prevalence of clinical and pathological covariates, (ii) differences in gene covariance that could be caused by batch, platform, or tumor purity effects, and (iii) differences in the \"true\" model that associates gene expression and clinical factors to outcome. We assess model accuracy, while altering these factors. Lower accuracy is seen in CSV than in CV. Surprisingly, heterogeneity in known clinical covariates and differences in gene covariance structure have very limited contributions in the loss of accuracy when validating in new studies. However, forcing identical generative models greatly reduces the within/across study difference. These results, observed consistently for multiple disease outcomes and omics platforms, suggest that the most easily identifiable sources of study heterogeneity are not necessarily the primary ones that undermine the ability to accurately replicate the accuracy of omics prediction models in new studies. Unidentified heterogeneity, such as could arise from unmeasured confounding, may be more important."

Recent whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies have shown that rare, damaging de novo and inherited mutations with large effect contribute to ~ 25% of sporadic CH. Interestingly, multiple CH genes are key regulators of neural stem cell growth and differentiation and converge in human transcriptional networks and cell types pertinent to fetal neurogliogenesis. These data implicate genetic disruption of early brain development as the primary pathomechanism in a substantial minority of patients with sporadic CH, shedding new light on human brain development and the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus.

Among the C. difficile isolates compared, R20291, a recent hypervirulent outbreak-associated strain, appears to have an expanded nutrient utilization profile when compared to all other strains.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The expanded nutritional utilization profile of some newer C. difficile strains could be one of the reasons for infections in patients who are not exposed to the hospital environment or not undergoing antibiotic treatment. This nutritional profile could be used to design tube feeding formulas that reduce the risk of CDI."

The term \"designer\" microarray, which we introduced in the course of the Dectin-1 study refers to a microarray of oligosaccharide probes generated from ligand-bearing glycoconjugates to reveal the oligosaccharide ligands they harbor, so that these can be isolated and characterized. Oligosaccharide probes were generated from two polysaccharides, one that was bound by Dectin-1 and known to be rich in β1,3-glucose sequence and another that was not bound and was rich in β1,6-glucose sequence and served as a negative control. The approach involved: classic ELISA-type binding assays to select the polysaccharides; partial depolymerization of the polysaccharides by chemical hydrolysis; fractionation by size of the glucan oligosaccharides obtained and determination of their chain lengths by mass spectrometry; detection of Dectin-1 ligand-positive and ligand-negative oligosaccharides using the neoglycolipid (NGL) technology; methylation analysis of oligosaccharides to derive glucose linkage information, and incorporation of the newly generated glucan oligosaccharide probes into microarrays encompassing diverse mammalian-type and exogenous sequences for microarray analysis of Dectin-1."

High-throughput and general binding assays may provide a path for discovering small molecules that target proteins for which little is known about structure or function or for which conventional functional assays have failed. One such binding assay involves small-molecule microarrays (SMMs) containing compounds that have been arrayed and immobilized onto a solid support.

Several suitable methods for manufacturing SMMs exist and different immobilization methods may be more or less preferable for any given application.

Analysis of microarrays requires several steps, including microarray imaging, identification of cell spots, quality control, and data exploration. While high content image analysis, cell counting, and cell pattern recognition methods are established, there is a need for new postprocessing and quality control methods for cell-based microarrays used to investigate combinatorial microenvironments. Previously, microarrayed cell spot identification and quality control were performed manually, leading to excessive processing time and potentially resulting in human bias. This work introduces an automated approach to identify cell-based microarray spots and spot quality control. The approach was used to analyze the adhesion of murine cardiac side population cells on combinatorial arrays of extracellular matrix proteins. Microarrays were imaged by automated fluorescence microscopy and cells were identified using open-source image analysis software (CellProfiler). From these images, clusters of cells making up single cell spots were reliably identified by analyzing the distances between cells using a density-based clustering algorithm (OPTICS). Naïve Bayesian classifiers trained on manually scored training sets identified good and poor quality spots using spot size, number of cells per spot, and cell location as quality control criteria. Combined, the approach identified 78% of high quality spots and 87% of poor quality spots. Full factorial analysis of the resulting microarray data revealed that collagen IV exhibited the highest positive effect on cell attachment. This data processing approach allows for fast and unbiased analysis of cell-based microarray data."

Here, we present a strategy that employs standard MALDI time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) for the sensitive and accurate quantification of saquinavir from an extract of blood peripheral mononuclear cells. Unambiguous identification of saquinavir in the mass spectra was possible because of using internal mass calibration and by an overall low chemical noise in the low mass range. Exact mass determination of the constant background peaks of the cell extract, which were used for recalibration, was performed by an initial MALDI-FT-MS analysis. Fast and multiplexed sample analysis was enabled by microarray technology, which provided 10 replicates in the lower nL range for each sample in parallel lanes on a chip.

The impact of such detection methods, however, has yet not fully been exploited, mainly due to a lack of appropriate mathematical tools for robust data analysis. One particular example relates to the analysis of microarray data. While classical microarray analysis works at resolutions of 2-20 microm and quantifies the abundance of target molecules by determining average pixel intensities, a novel high-resolution approach directly visualizes individual bound molecules as diffraction-limited peaks. The now possible quantification via counting is less susceptible to labeling artifacts and background noise. We have developed an approach for the analysis of high-resolution microarray images. First, it consists of a single-molecule detection step, based on undecimated wavelet transforms, and second, a spot identification step via spatial statistics approach (corresponding to the segmentation step in the classical microarray analysis). The detection method was tested on simulated images with a concentration range of 0.001 to 0.5 molecules per square micrometer and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between 0.9 and 31.6. For SNR above 15, the false negatives relative error was below 15%. Separation of foreground/background is proved reliable, in case foreground density exceeds background by a factor of 2.

            "abstract": "An easy chemical strategy was proposed and used to establish a method for direct anchoring of intact saccharides on solid surfaces with well conserved bioaffinity. The anchoring was achieved by temperature-modulated stepwise reactions with cyanuric chloride as a key linker, and was successfully applied to the fabrication of saccharide chips. To demonstrate, 15 intact reducing and nonreducing saccharides with various molecular sizes were dotted on a cyanuric-chloride-modified chip (1.0 × 1.0 cm(2)) and made to react with lectins. As expected, the anchored saccharides were capable of recognizing their target lectins, and more exciting were the perfect conservation of the specific recognizing ability of the anchored monosaccharides such as mannose, glucose, and even fructose (interacting only weakly with concanavalin A). This conservation was ascribed to the maintenance of the original structure (especially the anomeric configuration) of saccharides after immobilization and to the allowance of the anchored saccharides to rotate with and/or on the scaffold of cyanuric chloride, which makes them easily adapt to the recognition-preferred spatial position. The expected linkage of saccharides on cyanuric chloride and the maintenance of their anomeric configuration were characterized by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, respectively. The new method can be highlighted not only by its conservation of saccharide bioaffinity and universal applicability but also by its merits of easy manipulation or facile control of the reactions and cost-effectiveness due to the use of extremely cheap cyanuric chloride."

Two of the newer genetic technologies in the prenatal setting are chromosomal microarray and whole-exome sequencing. Chromosomal microarray analysis is a method of measuring gains and losses of DNA throughout the human genome. It can identify chromosomal aneuploidy and other large changes in the structure of chromosomes as well as submicroscopic abnormalities that are too small to be detected by traditional modalities. Prenatal chromosomal microarray analysis is recommended for a patient with a fetus with one or more major structural abnormalities identified on ultrasonographic examination and who is undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis. Whole-genome sequencing analyzes the entire genome, including noncoding regions (introns) and coding regions (exons). However, because the introns are typically of little clinical relevance, there has been a focus instead on whole-exome sequencing, which examines the coding regions (exons) of the genome. The exons generally have greater clinical relevance and applicability to patient care. However, the routine use of whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis is not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials."

Due to the formidable heterogeneity of intermixed cell types that make up the brain, isolating cell types prior to microarray processing poses steep technical challenges that have been met in various ways. These methodological differences have the potential to distort cell-type-specific gene expression profiles insofar as they may insufficiently filter out contaminating mRNAs or induce aberrant cellular responses not normally present in vivo. Thus we have compared the repeatability, susceptibility to contamination from off-target cell-types, and evidence for stress-responsive gene expression of five different purification methods--Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP), Immunopanning (PAN), Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), and manual sorting of fluorescently labeled cells (Manual). We found that all methods obtained comparably high levels of repeatability, however, data from LCM and TRAP showed significantly higher levels of contamination than the other methods. While PAN samples showed higher activation of apoptosis-related, stress-related and immediate early genes, samples from FACS and Manual studies, which also require dissociated cells, did not. Given that TRAP targets actively translated mRNAs, whereas other methods target all transcribed mRNAs, observed differences may also reflect translational regulation."

METHODS Clinical and brain imaging data from 28 PaVM patients (including 10 patients from 5 families) were retrospectively studied. Five children were included. In adult patients, the age at onset was 56.0 ± 16.7 years. Tetraventricular dilation, aqueductal opening with flow void on T2-weighted images, and a wide foramen of Magendie and large cisterna magna (wide cerebrospinal fluid space at the fourth ventricle outlet) were essential MRI findings for PaVM diagnosis. 3D fast asymmetrical spin echo sequences were used for visualization of cistern membranes. Time-spatial labeling inversion pulse examination was performed to analyze cerebrospinal fluid movement. Copy number variations were determined using high-resolution microarray and were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction with breakpoint sequencing. RESULTS Adult patients showed gait disturbance, urinary dysfunction, and cognitive dysfunction. Five infant patients exhibited macrocranium. Patients were divided into 2 subcategories, those with or without downward bulging third ventricular floors and membranous structures in the prepontine cistern. Patients with bulging floors were successfully treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy. Genetic analysis revealed a deletion in DNAH14 that encodes a dynein heavy chain protein associated with motile cilia function, and which co-segregated with patients in a family without a downward bulging third ventricular floor. CONCLUSIONS Panventriculomegaly with a wide foramen of Magendie and a large cisterna magna may belong to a subtype of congenital hydrocephalus with familial accumulation, younger age at onset, and symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus.

This is often hindered by the cell wall structure and endogenous RNase activity in filamentous fungi. There is thus a need for rapid methods for the extraction of good quality RNA for use in microarrays and for quantitative PCR assays. The objective of this study was to examine the use of different systems for the high throughput method to extract intact RNA from filamentous fungi. Two bead beating systems with different motion patterns and speed capacities were tested in the development of the extraction protocol. They were evaluated based on the total RNA yield and overall RNA quality. The high speed bead beating with glass beads associated with an automated purification method gave more than three times higher total RNA yields with less than a quarter of the amount of mycelium required. Furthermore the integrity and overall quality was conserved, with RNA Quality Indicator (RQI) numbers consistently >7.5. This method also reduced cross contamination risks and kept RNA handling to a minimum while still being capable of multiple sample processing, reducing the time required to obtain RNA from filamentous fungi."

Therefore we have examined neuroinflammation at both the cellular and the molecular levels in an experimental model of neonatal obstructive hydrocephalus. On post-natal day 1, rats received an intracisternal injection of kaolin to induce hydrocephalus; control animals received saline injections. Prior to sacrifice on post-natal day 22, animals underwent magnetic resonance imaging to quantify ventricular enlargement, and the parietal cortex was harvested for analysis. Immunohistochemistry and light microscopy were performed on 5 hydrocephalic and 5 control animals; another set of 5 hydrocephalic and 5 control animals underwent molecular testing with Western blots and a gene microarray. Scoring of immunoreactivity on a 4-point ranking scale for GFAP and Iba-1 demonstrated an increase in reactive astrocytes and reactive microglia respectively in the hydrocephalic animals compared to controls (2.90±0.11 vs. 0.28±0.26; 2.91±0.11 vs. 0.58±0.23, respectively). Western blots confirmed these results. Microarray analysis identified significant (1.5-fold) changes in 1729 of 33,951 genes, including 26 genes out of 185 genes (26/185) in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, antigen processing and presentation pathways (15/66), and the apoptosis pathway (10/69). Collectively, these results demonstrate alterations in normal physiology and an up-regulation of the inflammatory response. These findings lead to a better understanding of neonatal hydrocephalus and begin to form a baseline for future treatments that may reverse these effects."

            "abstract": "Genomic microarray analysis is increasingly being applied as a prenatal diagnostic tool. Microarrays enable searching the genome at a higher resolution and with higher sensitivity than conventional karyotyping for identifying clinically significant chromosomal abnormalities. As yet, no clear guidelines exist on whether microarrays should be applied prenatally for all indications or only in selected cases such as ultrasound abnormalities, whether a targeted or genome-wide array should be used, and what these should include exactly. In this paper, we present some ethical considerations on the prenatal use of microarrays. There is a strong consensus, at least in Western countries, that the aim of prenatal screening for foetal abnormalities should be understood as facilitating autonomous reproductive choice for prospective parents. The tests offered should be valid and useful to reach that purpose. Against this background, we address several ethical issues raised by the prenatal application of microarrays. First, we argue that the general distinction between a targeted and a genome-wide microarray needs to be scrutinised. Then we examine whether microarrays are 'suitable tests' to serve either a screening or a diagnostic purpose. Given the wide range of findings possibly generated by microarrays, the question arises whether microarrays actually promote or interfere with autonomous reproductive decision-making. Moreover, if variants of unknown clinical significance are identified, this adds to the burden and complexity of reproductive decision-making. We suggest a qualified use of microarrays in the prenatal context."

This involves mixing monomers at varied ratios to produce a library of monomer solutions, transferring the solution to a glass slide format using a robotic printing device and curing with UV irradiation. This format is readily amenable to many biological assays, including stem cell attachment and proliferation, cell sorting and low bacterial adhesion, allowing the ready identification of 'hit' materials that fulfill a specific biological criterion (3-5). Furthermore, the use of high throughput surface characterization (HTSC) allows the biological performance to be correlated with physio-chemical properties, hence elucidating the biological-material interaction (6). HTSC makes use of water contact angle (WCA) measurements, atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). In particular, ToF-SIMS provides a chemically rich analysis of the sample that can be used to correlate the cell response with a molecular moiety. In some cases, the biological performance can be predicted from the ToF-SIMS spectra, demonstrating the chemical dependence of a biological-material interaction, and informing the development of hit materials (5,3)."

In the present paper, we combine lensless holographic imaging with antibody microarrays for rapid and multiparametric analysis of leukocytes from human blood. Monoclonal antibodies (Abs) specific for leukocyte surface antigens (CD4 and CD8) and cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-2) were printed in an array so as to juxtapose cell capture and cytokine detection antibody (Ab) spots. Integration of Ab microarrays into a microfluidic flow chamber (4 muL volume) followed by incubation with human blood resulted in capture of CD4 and CD8 T-cells on specific Ab spots. On-chip mitogenic activation of these cells induced release of cytokine molecules that were subsequently captured on neighboring anticytokine Ab spots. The binding of IL-2, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma molecules on their respective Ab spots was detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anticytokine Abs and a visible color reagent. Lensfree holographic imaging was then used to rapidly ( approximately 4 s) enumerate CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes captured on Ab spots and to quantify the cytokine signal emanating from IL-2, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma spots on the same chip. To demonstrate the utility of our approach for infectious disease monitoring, blood samples of healthy volunteers and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients were analyzed to determine the CD4/CD8 ratio, an important HIV/AIDS diagnostic marker. The ratio obtained by lensfree on-chip imaging of CD4 and CD8 T-cells captured on Ab spots was in close agreement with conventional microscopy-based cell counting. The present paper, describing tandem use of Ab microarrays and lensfree holographic imaging, paves the way for future development of miniature cytometry devices for multiparametric blood analysis at the point of care or in a resource-limited setting."

This limitation is especially true in France where termination of pregnancy for medical reasons may be performed at any stage of gestation. During a period of 15 months, we investigated 382 fetuses presenting with ultrasound anomalies, using a customized microarray designed to avoid the detection of CNVs raising challenges for genetic counseling. After excluding common aneuploidies, 20/374 (5.3%) fetuses had a pathogenic CNV, among which 12/374 (3.2%) could have been detected by karyotyping, whereas 8/374 (2.1%) were cryptic. Within these 374 cases, 300 were ongoing pregnancies at the time of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) testing. For these pregnancies, we detected 18/300 (6%) pathogenic CNVs, among which 6/300 (2%) were cryptic. Using this approach, only 2/300 (0.6%) of the detected CNVs raised difficulties for genetic counseling. This study confirms the added value of this strategy in a prenatal clinical setting to minimize ethical issues for genetic counseling while enhancing the detection of genomic imbalances."

            "abstract": "Macrophages play an important role in first-line host defense of innate immune in fishes. However, it is difficult to investigate cellular mechanism of immune response in fish species with little genomic information available. Here we present the first use of RNA-Sequencing to study the macrophage transcriptome of ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis, which is an economically important fish in East Asia. De novo assembly generated 49,808 non-redundant consensus sequences, among which 23,490 transcripts found respective coding sequences. 15,707 transcripts are predicted to be involved in known metabolic or signaling pathways. The sequences were then used to develop a microarray for measurement the effect of recombinant LECT2 on ayu macrophages. LECT2 altered expression of a variety of genes mainly implicated in actin cytoskeleton, pattern recognition receptors and cytokines. Meanwhile, LECT2 enhanced phagocytosis, bacterial killing, and respiratory burst in ayu macrophages, which supported the thought derived from the microarray data that LECT2 activates macrophages. In conclusion, our results contribute to understanding the specific regulation mechanism of LECT2 in macrophage activation, and the combination of transcriptome analysis and microarray assay is a good method for screening a special tissue or cell response to a stimulus or pathogen in non-model fish species."

Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) is a popular statistical approach for identification of DE genes for both small- and large-sample cases. However, it is sensitive to outlying gene expressions and produces low power in presence of outliers. Therefore, in this paper, an attempt is made to robustify the SAM approach using the minimum β-divergence estimators instead of the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters. We demonstrated the performance of the proposed method in a comparison of some other popular statistical methods such as ANOVA, SAM, LIMMA, KW, EBarrays, GaGa, and BRIDGE using both simulated and real gene expression datasets. We observe that all methods show good and almost equal performance in absence of outliers for the large-sample cases, while in the small-sample cases only three methods (SAM, LIMMA, and proposed) show almost equal and better performance than others with two or more conditions. However, in the presence of outliers, on an average, only the proposed method performs better than others for both small- and large-sample cases with each condition."

However, limma has the additional advantage of being able to report significance cut off, making it a more practical tool. In addition, limma and TTCA can be satisfactorily used for datasets with time-series data for all experimental groups.

It is a heterogeneous and multifactorial clinical condition. Several methodologies have been used to identify the genetic causes of ID and in recent years new generation sequencing techniques, such as exome sequencing, have enabled an increase in the detection of new pathogenic variants and new genes associated with ID. The aim of this study was to evaluate exome sequencing with analysis of the ID gene panel as a tool to increase the diagnostic yield of patients with ID/GDD/MCA in Central Brazil, together with karyotype and CMA tests. A retrospective cohort study was carried out with 369 patients encompassing both sexes. Karyotype analysis was performed for all patients. CMA was performed for patients who did not present structural and or numerical alterations in the karyotype. Cases that were not diagnosed after performing karyotyping and CMA were referred for exome sequencing using a gene panel for ID that included 1,252 genes. The karyotype identified chromosomal alterations in 34.7% (128/369). CMA was performed in 83 patients who had normal karyotype results resulting in a diagnostic yield of 21.7% (18/83). Exome sequencing with analysis of the ID gene panel was performed in 19 trios of families that had negative results with previous methodologies. With the ID gene panel analysis, we identified mutations in 63.1% (12/19) of the cases of which 75% (9/12) were pathogenic variants,8.3% (1/12) likely pathogenic and in 16.7% (2/12) it concerned a Variant of Uncertain Significance. With the three methodologies applied, it was possible to identify the genetic cause of ID in 42.3% (156/369) of the patients. In conclusion, our studies show the different methodologies that can be useful in diagnosing ID/GDD/MCA and that whole exome sequencing followed by gene panel analysis, when combined with clinical and laboratory screening, is an efficient diagnostic strategy."

            "abstract": "## Introduction\nVentriculomegaly (VM) is identified on prenatal ultrasound in 0.3-2.0 per 1000 pregnancies and is categorized into three groups based on measurement at the atrial level: mild (≥10-<12mm), moderate (≥12-<15mm), and severe (≥15mm). The literature suggests that approximately 2 to 15% of fetuses with identified VM have an abnormal karyotype, with lower prevalence in isolated cases (1.5-12%) compared to cases with additional anomalies (9.5-36%). Infectious etiologies and clotting disorders are causal in some. Isolated VM has been associated with many types of chromosomal anomalies, the most common being trisomy 21. Other chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy 18, trisomy 13, monosomy X, and triploidy), large deletions and duplications (1q dup, 7p dup, 5p del, and 4p del), microdeletion syndromes (22q11.2 del, 15q11.2 microdel, 16p13.11 microdel and microdupl, 1p36 microdel) and single gene disorders (L1CAM, AP1S2, MPDZ, CCDC88C, EML1, WDR81, NSD1) have also been reported. The objective of this study was to describe the genetic differences seen in our cohort of fetuses prenatally diagnosed with isolated moderate to severe VM.\n## Methods\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of patients that were referred for VM between April 2016 to August 2021. Patients were evaluated by high resolution ultrasound and fetal neuro MRI and offered genetic counseling and testing. A total of 144 patients were identified of which 50 went on to have postnatal neurology evaluation. 54 pregnancies resulted in terminations and 13 pregnancies were delivered but lost to follow up.\n## Results\nOf the 131 patients identified, 70 had isolated VM and 61 had additional structural anomalies that excluded them from the analysis. In isolated cases, 67% (47/70) had genetic testing and 40% (19/47) of those had abnormal results (Table 1). 74% (35/47) had cytogenetic testing including karyotype and microarray. 11% (4/35) of patients who underwent cytogenetic testing had abnormal microarray, all of which were thought to be causative of the prenatal findings. 40% of patients (19/47) had single gene next generation sequencing and of those 31.5% (6/19) had positive test results, all of which were thought to be causal. 30% (14/47) of patients had Exome Sequencing (ES). 64% (9/14) had positive results, 67% (6/9) of which were felt to be contributory to disease, with an additional variant of uncertain significance and two pathogenic findings that were unrelated to VM but did impact clinical management. One patient had CMV infection and another had Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia.\n## Conclusion\nAdvances in genetic testing have allowed us to identify etiologies of VM that were previously unknown. As technology has improved, patients with VM have gained more meaningful test results as evidenced by our ES findings. Our 30% diagnostic rate does not represent the full genetic potential of this cohort as barriers to genetic testing still exist such as cost, timing, and understanding of testing strategy. A portion of this population was lost to follow up, declined prenatal testing, or had work up that included only cytogenetic testing. This cohort represents the need for a standardized approach to testing strategy in those with prenatally detected isolated moderate to severe VM. A proposed testing strategy for cases of prenatally identified moderate or severe VM should include 1) diagnostic testing for chromosomal abnormalities with a karyotype and microarray, 2) Infectious PCR Testing and Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia work up, 3) L1CAM gene sequencing for affected males, and 4) consideration of exome sequencing (ES)."

            "abstract": "The rise of the 'omics' technologies started nearly a decade ago and, among them, transcriptomics has been used successfully to contrast gene expression in mammalian oocytes and early embryos. The scarcity of biological material that early developmental stages provide is the prime reason why the field of transcriptomics is becoming more and more popular with reproductive biologists. The potential to amplify scarce mRNA samples and generate the necessary amounts of starting material enables the relative measurement of RNA abundance of thousands of candidates simultaneously. So far, microarrays have been the most commonly used high-throughput method in this field. Microarray platforms can be found in a wide variety of formats, from cDNA collections to long or short oligo probe sets. These platforms generate large amounts of data that require the integration of comparative RNA abundance values in the physiological context of early development for their full benefit to be appreciated. Unfortunately, significant discrepancies between datasets suggest that direct comparison between studies is difficult and often not possible. We have investigated the sample-handling steps leading to the generation of microarray data produced from prehatching embryo samples and have identified key steps that significantly impact the downstream results. This review provides a discussion on the best methods for the preparation of samples from early embryos for microarray analysis and focuses on the challenges that impede dataset comparisons from different platforms and the reasons why methodological benchmarking performed using somatic cells may not apply to the atypical nature of prehatching development."

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, there has been a growth of interest in the translation of microfluidic systems into real-world clinical practice, especially for use in point-of-care or near patient settings. While initial fabrication advances in microfluidics involved mainly the etching of silicon and glass, the economics of scaling of these materials is not amendable for point-of-care usage where single-test applications force cost considerations to be kept low and throughput high. As such, materials base more consistent with point-of-care needs is required. In this manuscript, the fabrication of a hot embossed, through-hole low-density polyethylene ensembles derived from an anisotropically etched silicon wafer is discussed. This semi-opaque polymer that can be easily sterilized and recycled provides low background noise for fluorescence measurements and yields more affordable cost than other thermoplastics commonly used for microfluidic applications such as cyclic olefin copolymer (COC). To fabrication through-hole microchips from this alternative material for microfluidics, a fabrication technique that uses a high-temperature, high-pressure resistant mold is described. This aluminum-based epoxy mold, serving as the positive master mold for embossing, is casted over etched arrays of pyramidal pits in a silicon wafer. Methods of surface treatment of the wafer prior to casting and PDMS casting of the epoxy are discussed to preserve the silicon wafer for future use. Changes in the thickness of polyethylene are observed for varying embossing temperatures. The methodology described herein can quickly fabricate 20 disposable, single use chips in less than 30 min with the ability to scale up 4 times by using multiple molds simultaneously. When coupled as a platform supporting porous bead sensors, as in the recently developed Programmable Bio-Nano-Chip, this bead chip system can achieve limits of detection, for the cardiac biomarker C-reactive protein, of 0.3 ng/mL, thereby demonstrating that the approach is compatible with high performance, real-world clinical measurements in the context of point-of-care testing."

Moreover, we aimed to estimate the prognosis of IMVM fetuses and compare the difference in the prognosis of IMVM fetuses presenting symmetric and asymmetric cortical maturation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      IMVM was diagnosed by regular ultrasound, neurosonography and fetal MRI. Genetic and TORCH examinations were conducted to exclude common genetic abnormalities and TORCH infection of fetuses. Ultrasound examinations were conducted at an interval of 2-3 weeks to record sulcus development in IMVM fetuses using a scoring system. The neonatal behavioral neurological assessment (NBNA), the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition (ASQ-3) and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, First Edition (BSID-I) were performed after birth.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Forty fetuses with IMVM were included: twenty showed asymmetric cortical maturation and twenty showed symmetric cortical maturation. For IMVM fetuses presenting asymmetric cortical maturation, the mean gestational age (GA) at the first diagnosis of relatively delayed development was 24.23 weeks for the parieto-occipital sulcus, 24.71 weeks for the calcarine sulcus, and 26.43 weeks for the cingulate sulcus. All the sulci with delayed development underwent 'catch-up growth' and developed to the same grade as the sulci of the other hemisphere. The mean GA at which the two sides developed to the same grade was 29.40 weeks for the parieto-occipital sulcus, 29.30 weeks for the calcarine sulcus and 31.27 weeks for the cingulate sulcus.

            "abstract": "Precision medicine in oncology requires an accurate characterization of a tumor molecular profile for patient stratification. Though targeted deep sequencing is an effective tool to detect the presence of somatic sequence variants, a significant number of patient specimens do not meet the requirements needed for routine clinical application. Analysis is hindered by contamination of normal cells and inherent tumor heterogeneity, compounded with challenges of dealing with minute amounts of tissue and DNA damages common in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. Here we present an innovative workflow using DEPArray™ system, a microchip-based digital sorter to achieve 100%-pure, homogenous subpopulations of cells from FFPE samples. Cells are distinguished by fluorescently labeled antibodies and DNA content. The ability to address tumor heterogeneity enables unambiguous determination of true-positive sequence variants, loss-of-heterozygosity as well as copy number variants. The proposed strategy overcomes the inherent trade-offs made between sensitivity and specificity in detecting genetic variants from a mixed population, thus rescuing for analysis even the smaller clinical samples with low tumor cellularity."

The advantage of microarray technology is the possibility of rapid analysis of multiple targets in a single sample with a high sensitivity, which makes them ideal for high throughput screening. Usually these microarrays contain biological recognition molecules, such as full-size antibodies, antigen-binding fragments, and single-domain antibodies, and a label for detection. Organic fluorophores are the most popular labels, but they suffer from low sensitivity and instability due to their photodegradation. Here, we describe a protocol for fabricating an antibody microarray with highly fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots (QDs) as the source of fluorescent signals, which may significantly improve the properties of microarrays, including their sensitivity and specificity. Our approach to analyte detection is based on the use of sandwich approach with streptavidin-biotin to assess and monitor the fluorescence signal instead of direct labeling of samples, which helps improve the reproducibility of results and sensitivity of the microarrays. The antibody microarray developed has been tested for its capacity of detecting DNA-PKcs in glial cell lines and measuring cell protein phosphorylation changes caused by camptothecin-induced DNA damage with different protein kinase inhibitors in HeLa cells."

Next, the partially filled wells are analyzed by SVM and their tendency towards filled or unfilled tested through applying a Gaussian filter.

            "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has brought a radical approach to systems biology, offering a platform to study complex biological functions. However, key proteomic technical challenges remain, mainly the inability to characterise the complete proteome of a cell due to the thousands of diverse, complex proteins expressed at an extremely wide concentration range. Currently, high throughput and efficient techniques to unambiguously identify and quantify proteins on a proteome-wide scale are in demand. Miniaturised analytical systems placed upstream of MS help us to attain these goals. One time-consuming step in traditional techniques is the in-solution digestion of proteins (4-20 h). This also has other drawbacks, including enzyme autoproteolysis, low efficiency, and manual operation. Furthermore, the identification of α-helical membrane proteins has remained a challenge due to their high hydrophobicity and lack of trypsin cleavage targets in transmembrane helices. We demonstrate a new rapidly produced glass/PDMS micro Immobilised Enzyme Reactor (µIMER) with enzymes covalently immobilised onto polyacrylic acid plasma-modified surfaces for the purpose of rapidly (as low as 30 s) generating peptides suitable for MS analysis. This µIMER also allows, for the first time, rapid digestion of insoluble proteins. Membrane protein identification through this method was achieved after just 4 min digestion time, up to 9-fold faster than either dual-stage in-solution digestion approaches or other commonly used bacterial membrane proteomic workflows."

Initially, cerebral ventriculomegaly and calcification were also found with computed tomography, and severe hearing loss was detected with auditory brainstem response testing. After treatment, CMV DNA decreased in copy number and became undetectable. No marked side effects occurred after treatment. Surprisingly, 1 year after treatment, neurological and motor development was equivalent to that in a healthy infant. Audiometry indicated that auditory ability would improve with rehabilitation, speech and language therapy, and cochlear implantation.

            "abstract": "Heterozygous mutations in KIDINS220 were recently suggested a cause of spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability, nystagmus and obesity. All patients carried terminal nonsense de novo mutations that seemed to escape nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The mechanism for pathogenicity is yet unexplained, as it seems that heterozygous loss-of-function variants of KIDINS220 are generally well tolerated. We present a consanguineous couple who experienced four pregnancy terminations due to repeated findings in the fetuses comprising enlarged cerebral ventricles and limb contractures. Exome sequencing in two of the aborted fetuses revealed a shared homozygous frameshift variant in exon 24 in KIDINS220. Sanger sequencing of the variant in available family members showed complete segregation with the affection status, resulting in a LOD score of 2.5 under an autozygous inheritance model. mRNA studies revealed destruction of the original splice site, resulting in an out-of-frame transcript and introduction of a premature termination codon in exon 25. Premature termination codons in this position are likely to cause activation of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and result in complete absence of KIDINS220 protein in individuals homozygous for the variant. The phenotype of the presented fetuses overlaps with findings in functional studies of knockout Kidins220 mice embryos that are non-viable with enlarged cerebral ventricles. The human fetuses also exhibit several similarities to the milder phenotype described in patients with heterozygous KIDINS220 mutations. We hence propose that the identified homozygous loss-of-function variant in KIDINS220 causes the phenotype in the presented fetuses, and that this represents a hitherto undescribed severe autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder."

            "abstract": "It is increasingly common to monitor the marine environment and establish geographic trends of environmental contamination by measuring contaminant levels in animals from higher trophic levels. The health of an ecosystem is largely reflected in the health of its inhabitants. As an apex predator, the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) can reflect the health of near shore marine ecosystems, and reflect coastal threats that pose risk to human health, such as legacy contaminants or marine toxins, e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and brevetoxins. Major advances in the understanding of dolphin biology and the unique adaptations of these animals in response to the marine environment are being made as a result of the development of cell-lines for use in in vitro experiments, the production of monoclonal antibodies to recognize dolphin proteins, the development of dolphin DNA microarrays to measure global gene expression and the sequencing of the dolphin genome. These advances may play a central role in understanding the complex and specialized biology of the dolphin with regard to how this species responds to an array of environmental insults. This work presents the creation, characterization and application of a new molecular tool to better understand the complex and unique biology of the common bottlenose dolphin and its response to environmental stress and infection. A dolphin oligo microarray representing 24,418 unigene sequences was developed and used to analyze blood samples collected from 69 dolphins during capture-release health assessments at five geographic locations (Beaufort, NC, Sarasota Bay, FL, Saint Joseph Bay, FL, Sapelo Island, GA and Brunswick, GA). The microarray was validated and tested for its ability to: 1) distinguish male from female dolphins; 2) differentiate dolphins inhabiting different geographic locations (Atlantic coasts vs the Gulf of Mexico); and 3) study in detail dolphins resident in one site, the Georgia coast, known to be heavily contaminated by Aroclor 1268, an uncommon polychlorinated (PCB) mixture. The microarray was able to distinguish dolphins by sex, geographic location, and corroborate previously published health irregularities for the Georgia dolphins. Genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, development/differentiation and oncogenic pathways were found to be differentially expressed in GA dolphins. The report bridges the advancements in dolphin genome sequencing to the first step towards providing a cost-effective means to screen for indicators of chemical toxin exposure as well as disease status in top level predators."

While it is well established that it confers significant risk of morbidity and mortality to the neonate, there is limited information pertaining to the caesarean delivery rates and the obstetric management of these complex cases. The aim of this study was twofold: firstly, to determine survival rates in fetuses with severe VM, and secondly to determine the caesarean delivery rates in continuing pregnancies. We explore the obstetric challenges associated with these difficult cases.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a prospective observational study of patients with antenatal severe VM, attending the Department of Fetal Medicine, National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, from 1st January 2011 to 31st July 2020. Data were obtained from the hospital database and those with severe VM (Vp > 15 mm) were identified. The rates of chromosomal abnormalities, the survival rates and the caesarean delivery (CD) rates for the overall group were then determined. The data were then further sub-divided into two groups: 1. Vp < 20 mm and 2. Vp > 20 mm, and the results compared. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-Square test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of N = 95 pregnancies with severe VM were included for analysis, of which additional structural abnormalities on ultrasound were apparent in 67/95 (70.5%) and 28/95 (29.5%) had isolated severe VM. Chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed in 15/95 (15.8%) of cases, with (2/28) 7.1% in the isolated SVM group versus (13/67) 19.4% in the non-isolated SVM group. The overall survival rate (excluding TOP) was 53/74 (71.6%), with 20/23 (86.9%) in the isolated SVM group. The overall CD rate was 47/72 (65.3%), which was significantly higher than the CD for the hospital during the same time period of 25.4% (P < 0.01). The data were subdivided into Vp < 20 and Vp > 20 and those with a Vp > 20 had higher rates of additional intracranial findings on ultrasound (Vp < 20 13/41 (31.7%) versus Vp > 20 32/54 (59.3%) (P < 0.05)) and macrocrania (Vp < 20 14/41 (34.1%) versus Vp > 20 35/54 (64.8%) (P < 0.05)).

We demonstrate these characterization concepts using purified exosomes from a HEK 293 cell culture. As a demonstration of clinical utility, we characterize exosomes directly from human cerebrospinal fluid (hCSF). Our interferometric imaging method could capture, from a very small hCSF volume (20 uL), nanoparticles that have a size compatible with exosomes, using antibodies directed against tetraspanins.

Cells of the same genotype in different physiological and pathological states have unique morphological and structural features, therefore, it is possible to differentiate between them using their DEP responses. This paper reports the experimental discrimination of normal and dengue-infected human hepatic fetal epithelial cells (WRL-68 cells) based on their DEP crossover frequency, at which no resultant movement occurs in the cells in response to the DEP force. A microarray dot electrode was used to conduct the DEP experiments. The DEP forces applied to the cells were quantified by analyzing the light intensity shift within the electrode's dot region based on the Cumulative Modal Intensity Shift image analysis technique. The differences in dielectric properties between infected and uninfected cells were exploited by plotting a unique DEP spectrum for each set of cells. We observed that the crossover frequency decreased from 220 kHz for the normal WRL-68 cells to 140 kHz after infection with the dengue virus in a medium conductivity of 100 μS/cm. We conclude that the change in the DEP crossover frequency between dengue-infected cells and their healthy counterparts should allow direct characterization of these cell types by exploiting their electrophysiological properties."

The laser energy required to selectively remove these micropallets with attached cells from the array depends on the microstructure surface area in contact with the substrate. Laser energies sufficient to release micropallets greater than 100 μm resulted in loss of cell viability. A new three-dimensional culture site similar in appearance to a table was designed and fabricated using a simple process that relied on a differential sensitivity of two photoresists to UV-mediated photopolymerization. With this design, the larger culture area rests on four small supports to minimize the surface area in contact with the substrate. Microtables up to 250 × 250 μm were consistently released with single 10-μJ pulses to each of the four support structures. In contrast, microstructures with a 150 × 150-μm surface area in contact with the substrate could not be reliably released at pulse energies up to 212 μJ. Cassie-Baxter wetting is required to provide a barrier of air to localize and sequester cells to the culture sites. A second asset of the design was an increased retention of this air barrier under conditions of decreased surface tension and after prolonged culture of cells. The improved air retention was due to the hydrophobic cavity created beneath the table and above the substrate which entrapped air when an aqueous solution was added to the array. The microtables proved an efficient method for isolating colonies from the array with 100% of selected colonies competent to expand following release from the array."

Also, known problems of sol-gel adhesion to conventional microtiter well plate substrates are circumvented by anchoring the sol-gel microspots to a porous silion surface so-called, PS-SG chips. We confirmed low molecular weight chemical immobilization inside a sol-gel network using fluorescein. BPA and the BPA specific aptamer were utilized as a model pair to verify the affinity specific interaction in the PS-SG selection system. The aptamer interacted specifically with BPA in the sol-gel spots, as shown in microarrays forming the letters \"L\", \"U\", \"N\", and \"D\". Moreover, the bound aptamer was released by heat, recovered, and verified by gel electrophoresis. The developed PS-SG chip platform will be used for screening aptamers against numerous small molecules such as toxins, metabolites, or pesticide residues."

            "abstract": "Hydrocephalus does not indicate a single clinical entity, but includes a variety of clinicopathological conditions caused by excessive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) based on the disturbed circulation. Recent progress in prenatal neuroimagings such as MRI and ultrasound echoencephalography on fetus enables to understand clinicopathological conditions of CSF circulation disorder in conjunction with morphological changes in the central nervous system properly. It has been revealed that the CSF dynamics develop in the theory of evolution from the immature brain, as in the animals with the minor CSF pathway predominance, towards matured adult human brain together with the completion of the major CSF pathway: the \"Evolution Theory in CSF Dynamics\". Now, we can analyze CSF circulation dynamically and also analyze the flow velocity and direction of CSF movement. CENTER OF EXCELLENCE-FETAL HYDROCEPHALUS TOP 10 JAPAN: Along with this technical improvement, the standards of clinicopathological evaluation of hydrocephalus as well as the classification and concept of hydrocephalus shall undergo a major upgrade. Based on such remarkable improvement in the recent practical diagnostic evaluation of fetal hydrocephalus, it is now required to update the guideline for management and treatment of fetal and congenital hydrocephalus, and a nationwide study group; Center of Excellence-Fetal Hydrocephalus Top 10 Japan, was organized in 2008 in Japan. The retrospective analysis of 333 cases of congenital hydrocephalus indicated a fact that 43% of these cases were diagnosed prenatally, and the majority of cases were treated in these top 10 institutes in Japan. Now, congenital hydrocephalus diagnosed immediately after birth is regarded as to be based on embryonic stage; brain disorder in patients with congenital hydrocephalus should be considered in conjunction with neuronal mature process of embryonic stage. The fact is supported by the current trends in hydrocephalus research represented by \"Perspective Classification of Congenital Hydrocephalus\" and \"Multi-categorical Hydrocephalus Classification\". The ultimate goal of hydrocephalus treatment remains achieving arrested hydrocephalus by shunt surgeries. In the future, to achieve arrested hydrocephalus, minimum quantity of CSF to be drained should be elucidated. Consideration for accurate operative indication of ETV along with new neuroendoscopic device development and analysis of CSF circulation is expected in the future. The data in this prospective multicenter analysis in this guideline are credited in Oxford Evidence level 2b (Grade II)."

            "abstract": "Fetal cerebral ventriculomegaly is a relatively common finding, observed during approximately 1% of obstetric ultrasounds. In the second and third trimester, mild (≥10 mm) and severe ventriculomegaly (≥15 mm) are defined according to the measurement of distal lateral ventricles that is included in the routine sonographic examination of central nervous system. A detailed neurosonography and anatomy ultrasound should be performed to detect other associated anomalies in the central nervous system and in other systems, respectively. Fetal MRI might be useful when neurosonography is unavailable or suboptimal. The risk of chromosomal and non-chromosomal genetic disorders associated with ventriculomegaly is high, therefore invasive genetic testing, including microarray, is recommended. Screening for prenatal infections, in particular cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis, should also be carried out at diagnosis. The prognosis is determined by the severity of ventriculomegaly and/or by the presence of co-existing abnormalities. Fetal ventriculoamniotic shunting in progressive isolated severe ventriculomegaly is an experimental procedure. After delivery, ventricular-peritoneal shunting or ventriculostomy are the two available options to treat hydrocephalus in specific conditions with similar long-term outcomes. A multidisciplinary fetal neurology team, including perinatologists, geneticists, pediatric neurologists, neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons, can provide parents with the most thorough prenatal counseling. This review outlines the latest evidence on diagnosis and management of pregnancies complicated by fetal cerebral ventriculomegaly."

For example, optical beams of current photonic circuits can be more easily modulated by integral embedded cells into electrical signals on semiconductors. Such research responds to a recently published Grand Challenge in ceramic science, designing and synthesizing oxide electronics, surfaces, interfaces and nanoscale structures that can be tuned by biological stimuli, to reveal phenomena not otherwise possible with conventional semiconductor electronics.

With more Fe2O3 layers, bond resonance was enhanced via the Hall effect. The distribution of electromagnetic field enhancement was determined via SERS. The signal from the single-layer chip containing Au nanoparticles was measured in an external magnetic field. Maximum signal strength was recorded in a field strength of 12.5 gauss.

While red fluorescence from the PDA liposome microarrays was observed when the larger M1 antibody was used as a target, when the same M1 antibody was used as a probe to detect the smaller M1 peptide sensory signal did not appear. The results reveal that the intensity of the PDA sensory signal is mainly related to the steric repulsion between probe-target complexes not the strength of the probe-target binding force. Based on this finding, we devised a PDA sensory system that directly detects influenza A whole virus as a larger target, and confirmed the target size effect on the signaling efficiency of PDA."

These biosensors, to a certain extent, take the place of fluorescent methods by providing a comparable sensitivity as well as retaining the conformational and functional integrality of biomolecules to be investigated. More importantly, some of these biosensors are capable of real-time monitoring probe-target interactions, providing the binding affinities of these reactions. Using label-free biosensors in microarrays has become a current trend in developing high-throughput screening platforms for drug discoveries and applications in all areas of \"-omics.\" This article is aimed to provide principles and recent developments in label-free sensing technologies applicable to microarrays, with special attentions being paid to surface plasmon resonance microscopy and oblique-incidence reflectivity difference microscopy."

            "abstract": "Tracking and understanding cell-to-cell variability is fundamental for systems biology, cytomics and computational modelling that aids e.g. anti-cancer drug discovery. Limitations of conventional cell-based techniques, such as flow cytometry and single cell imaging, however, make the high-throughput dynamic analysis on cellular and subcellular processes tedious and exceedingly expensive. The development of microfluidic lab-on-a-chip technologies is one of the most innovative and cost-effective approaches towards integrated cytomics. Lab-on-a-chip devices promise greatly reduced costs, increased sensitivity and ultrahigh throughput by implementing parallel sample processing. The application of laminar fluid flow under low Reynolds numbers provides an attractive analytical avenue for the rapid delivery and exchange of reagents with exceptional accuracy. Under these conditions, the fluid flow has no inertia, enabling the precise dosing of drugs, both spatially and temporally. In addition, by confining the dimensions of the microfluidic structure, it is possible to facilitate the precise sequential delivery of drugs and/or functional probes into the cellular systems. As only low cell numbers and operational reagent volumes are required, high-throughput integrated cytomics on a single cell level finally appears within the reach of clinical diagnostics and drug screening routines. Lab-on-a-chip microfluidic technologies therefore provide new opportunities for the development of content-rich personalized clinical diagnostics and cost-effective drug discovery. It is largely anticipated that advances in microfluidic technologies should aid in tailoring of investigational therapies and support the current computational efforts in systems biology."

This biomass detection platform confers the advantage of absolute mass quantification and lower cost, easily implementable equipment. We discuss the advantages of this label when used in parallel with fluorescence detection. QDs represent a unique opportunity to improve sensitivity in both mass-label detection methods due to their large detectable mass, as well as in fluorescence detection, as they fluoresce without quenching. Streptavidin-conjugated QDs (SA-QDs) have been investigated as such a dual-role probe because of their large shape and mass, their 655nm emission peak for fluorescent detection platforms, and their robust insensitivity to photobleaching and quenching. In particular we explored their dual role in a microarrays immunoassay designed to detect antibodies against β-lactoglobulin, a common milk allergen. The SA-QDs formed a large detectable monolayer of 6.2ng/mm(2) in the saturation conditions, a mass signal corroborated by previous studies by Platt et al.."

Classification criteria are based either on CSF dynamics, pathophysiological mechanisms or associated lesions. Whereas inherited syndromic hydrocephalus has been associated with more than 100 disease-causing genes, only four genes are currently known to be linked to congenital hydrocephalus either isolated or as a major clinical feature: L1CAM, AP1S2, MPDZ and CCDC88C. In the past 10 years, pathogenic variants in CCDC88C have been documented but the neuropathology remains virtually unknown. We report the neuropathology of two foetuses from one family harbouring two novel compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the CCDC88C gene: a maternally inherited indel in exon 22, c.3807_3809delinsACCT;p.(Gly1270Profs*53) and a paternally inherited deletion of exon 23, c.3967-?_c.4112-?;p.(Leu1323Argfs*10). Medical termination of pregnancy was performed at 18 and 23 weeks of gestation for severe bilateral ventriculomegaly. In both fetuses, brain lesions consisted of multifocal atresia-forking along the aqueduct of Sylvius and the central canal of the medulla, periventricular neuronal heterotopias and choroid plexus hydrops. The second fetus also presented lumbar myelomeningocele, left diaphragmatic hernia and bilateral renal agenesis. CCDC88C encodes the protein DAPLE which contributes to ependymal cell planar polarity by inhibiting the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway and interacts with MPDZ and PARD3. Interestingly, heterozygous variants in PARD3 result in neural tube defects by defective tight junction formation and polarization process of the neuroepithelium. Besides, during organ formation Wnt signalling is a prerequisite for planar cell polarity pathway activation, and mutations in planar cell polarity genes lead to heart, lung and kidney malformations. Hence, candidate variants in CCDC88C should be carefully considered whether brain lesions are isolated or associated with malformations suspected to result from disorders of planar cell polarity."

However, obtaining the encapsulated droplet with an adjustable water-to-oil volume ratio and a further removable oil shell is not possible by reported techniques using manual pipetting or droplet splitting. We report a parallel-plate device capable of generation, encapsulation, rinsing, and emersion of water and/or oil droplets to achieve three major aims. The first aim of our experiments was to form encapsulated droplets by merging electrowetting-driven water droplets and dielectrophoresis-actuated oil droplets whose volumes were precisely controlled. 25 nL water droplets and 2.5 nL non-volatile silicone oil droplets with various viscosities (10, 100, and 1000 cSt) were individually created from their reservoirs to form encapsulated droplets holding different water-to-oil volume ratios of 10:1 and 2:1. Secondly, the driving voltages, evaporation rates, and biofouling of the precise encapsulated droplets were measured. Compared with the bare and immersed droplets, we found the encapsulated droplets (oil shells with lower viscosities and larger volumes) were driven at a smaller voltage or for a wider velocity range. In the dynamic evaporation tests, at a temperature of 20 ± 1 °C and relative humidity of 45 ± 3%, 10 cSt 10:1 and 2:1 encapsulated droplets were moved at the velocity of 0.25 mm s(-1) for 22 and 35 min until losing 16.6 and 17.5% water, respectively, while bare droplets followed the driving signal for only 6 min when 11.4% water was lost. Evaporation was further diminished at the rate of 0.04% min(-1) for a carefully positioned stationary encapsulated droplet. Biofouling of 5 μg ml(-1) FITC-BSA solution was found to be eliminated by the encapsulated droplet from the fluorescent images. The third aim of our research was to remove the oil shell by dissolving it in an on-chip rinsing reservoir containing hexane. After emersion from the rinsing reservoir, the bare droplet was restored as hexane rapidly evaporated. Removal of the oil shell would not only increase the evaporation of the core droplet when necessary, but also enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in the following detection steps."

Fuzzy logic allows summarising the information obtained by independent validation statistics into one synthetic indicator of overall method performance. The microarray technology, introduced for simultaneous identification of multiple GMOs, poses specific validation issues (patterns of performance for a variety of GMOs at different concentrations). A fuzzy-based indicator for overall evaluation is illustrated in this paper, and applied to validation data for different genetically modified elements. Remarks were drawn on the analytical results.

The phenotypic anomalies found by post-mortem and autopsy examinations were compared with those of similar cases reported in the literature. We performed standard cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Electronic tongue is a sensing system that is applied to detect different elements with the same sensor array. By analyzing responses from different measurement units, it enables a cross-sensitivity, namely, the ability of the system to responding to a range of different analytes in solution without specific functionalization of sensors. In this article, a six-unit sensing array system was fabricated by a laser direct writing process. Sensing units were introduced on a flexible polyamide surface. A high surface-volume ratio porous carbon structure was created by a laser-induced carbonization process, which provides stable conductive carbon electrodes with high sensitivity. Different surface treatments, such as gold plating, reduced-graphene oxide coating, and polyaniline coating, were accomplished for different measurement units. By applying principal component analysis, this sensing system shows a promising result for the detection of multiple flavors. The detection limit for each element is about 0.1 mM for NaCl and sugar solutions. Also, it is able to detect 10-4 times diluted commercial table vinegar solution, which originally contains 5% acetic acid. The detection limit is theoretically lower than the human threshold of 10 mM for NaCl and sugar. Besides, the sensing system shows a high sensitivity and selectivity for mixed elements. By mapping the data points, the sensor system could detect flavor combinations and provide a reliable prediction of analyte concentration ratios."

Other findings include various dysmorphic facial features as well as hand and foot anomalies. This syndrome is likely more common than suggested in the literature, as the clinical presentation can be variable, and the chromosome anomaly is unlikely to be found on routine karyotype of peripheral blood lymphocytes.

Microarray analysis performed on unstimulated lymphocytes from the patient in this report did not detect any evidence of the chromosome abnormality, indicating that this methodology may not be useful as a diagnostic tool in this disorder. Diagnosis of the mosaic tetrasomy 5p syndrome will rely on good clinical assessment, and appropriate cytogenetic studies, including analysis of skin fibroblasts. A child with unexplained developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, and ventriculomegaly with or without dysmorphic features should be assessed carefully for pigmentary changes of the skin.

Whereas previous studies have explored solid nanoposts, this work examines nanoposts constructed out of viscous inclusions. Langevin dynamics simulations are used to study the dynamics of polymers driven through arrays of these viscous nanoposts for a range of post viscosities. The results are compared to the solid post case. Increasing post viscosity causes a decrease in the mobility of polymers traversing the array. In the limit of high post viscosity, the mobility becomes lower than in the solid post arrays, rather than converging to it. Analysis of the distributions of event times also shows that the viscous case is fundamentally different from the solid post case. The decrease in mobility in the viscous case arises from slowing down the polymer as it interacts with or even moves through the nanoposts, whereas the solid post case exhibits wrapping and unwrapping dynamics, yielding escape-like statistics. This work suggests that it may be possible to use viscous inclusions within nanofluidic and microfluidic devices to sort biomolecules with high resolution."

Biomaterials scientists and engineers are tasked with designing materials that can at least partially recreate this complex signaling milieu towards new materials for biomedical applications. In this progress report, recent advances in high throughput techniques and high content imaging approaches that are facilitating the discovery of efficacious biomaterials are described. From microarrays of synthetic polymers, peptides and full-length proteins, to designer cell culture systems that present multiple biophysical and biochemical cues in tandem, it is discussed how the integration of combinatorics with high content imaging and analysis is essential to extracting biologically meaningful information from large scale cellular screens to inform the design of next generation biomaterials."

            "abstract": "Campomelic dysplasia is a rare skeletal dysplasia characterized by Pierre Robin sequence, craniofacial dysmorphism, shortening and angulation of long bones, tracheobronchomalacia, and occasionally sex reversal. The disease is due to mutations in SOX9 or chromosomal rearrangements involving the long arm of Chromosome 17 harboring the SOX9 locus. SOX9, a transcription factor, is indispensible in establishing and maintaining neural stem cells in the central nervous system. We present a patient with angulation of long bones and external female genitalia on prenatal ultrasound who was subsequently found to harbor the chromosomal abnormality 46, XY, t(6;17) (p21.1;q24.3) on prenatal genetic testing. Comparative genomic hybridization revealed deletions at 6p21.1 and 17q24.3, the latter being 2.3 Mb upstream of SOX9 Whole-exome sequencing did not identify pathogenic variants in SOX9, suggesting that the 17q24.3 deletion represents a translocation breakpoint farther upstream of SOX9 than previously identified. At 2 mo of age the patient developed progressive communicating ventriculomegaly and thinning of the cortical mantle without clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure. This case suggests ventriculomegaly in some cases represents not a primary impairment of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, but an epiphenomenon driven by a genetic dysregulation of neural progenitor cell fate."

            "abstract": "Molecular diagnostic techniques for viral testing have undergone rapid development in recent years. They are becoming more widely used than the classical virological assays in the majority of clinical virology laboratories, and now represent a new method for the diagnosis of human viral infections. Recently, new techniques based on multiplex RT-PCR amplification followed by microarray analysis have been developed and evaluated. On the basis of amplification of viral genome-specific fragments by multiplex RT-PCR and their subsequent detection via hybridization with microorganism-specific binding probes on solid surfaces, they allow simultaneous detection and identification of multiple viruses in a single clinical sample. The management of viral central nervous system and respiratory tract infections currently represents the two main applications of the microarrays in routine virological practice. Microarrays have shown reliable results in comparison with those of referenced (RT)-PCR assays, and appear to be of major interest for the detection of a broad range of respiratory and neurotropic viruses, assessment of the pathogenicity of newly discovered or neglected viruses, and identification of multiple viral infections in clinical samples. Despite several limitations observed during the different studies performed, this new technology might improve the clinical management of patients by enlarging the range of the viruses detected, in particular in cases of severe infections leading to patient hospitalization in the intensive-care unit. They might also help in the prevention of nosocomial transmission in hospital departments by contributing to the development of new epidemiological surveillance systems for viral infections."

When cytogenetic analysis showed normal chromosomes, the parents then received a consultation for chromosomal microarray (CMA) analysis, and a subsequent morphology scan was performed between 20 and 24 weeks gestation. Submicroscopic chromosomal abnormalities were assessed and compared between the fetuses with and without structural defects. Likewise, the prevalence of pathologic copy number variants (CNVs) among cases with increased NT was compared with the 926 low-risk cases consisted of patients whose sole indication for testing was advanced maternal age.Results: Chromosomal abnormality was identified in 32.29 (103/319) of fetuses, and 137 samples were tested using CMA. Additional pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) were also detected in 5.12% (7/137) of the fetuses. There was no significant difference in the abnormal detection rate between fetuses showing an abnormal morphology scan and those with a normal morphology scan (11.11% [2/18] versus 4.20% [5/119], respectively; p > .05). The prevalence of pathological CMA results in cases with increased NT was significantly higher when compared with the low-risk patients (5.12% [7/137] versus 1.19% [11/926], respectively; p = .0009).Conclusions: Nuchal translucency (NT) ≥3.0 mm are associated with the highest risk for a CMA abnormality. Submicroscopic chromosomal abnormalities should be accessed when the fetus was found to be with increased NT and normal karyotype. It is, therefore, important to inform parents in a professional prenatal counseling setting regarding the potential advantages of CMA."

            "abstract": "The hypothesis proposed here would provide near to optimum homeostasis for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) without the need for hemodialysis. This strategy has not been described previously in the scientific literature. It involves a targeted therapy that may prevent progression of the disease and help to improve the well-being of CKD patients. It proposes a nanotechnological device, ie, a microarray-oriented homeostasis provider (MOHP), to improve homeostasis in CKD patients. MOHP would be an auxiliary kidney aid, and would improve the filtration functions that impaired kidneys cannot perform by their own. MOHP is composed of two main computer-oriented components, ie, a quantitative microarray detector (QMD) and a homeostasis-oriented microarray column (HOMC). QMD detects and HOMC selectively removes defined quantities of uremic wastes, toxins and any other metabolites which is programmed for. The QMD and HOMC would accomplish this with the help of a peristaltic blood pump that would circulate blood aseptically in an extracorporeal closed circuit. During the passage of blood through the QMD, this microarray detector would quantitatively monitor all of the blood compounds that accumulate in the blood of a patient with impaired glomerular filtration, including small-sized, middle-sized and large-sized molecules. The electronic information collected by QMD would be electronically transmitted to the HOMC, which would adjust the molecules to the concentrations they are electronically programmed for and/or receive from QMD. This process of monitoring and removal of waste continues until the programmed homeostasis criteria are reached. Like a conventional kidney machine, MOHP can be used in hospitals and homes under the supervision of a trained technician. The main advantages of this treatment would include improved homeostasis, a reduced likelihood of side effects and of the morbidity resulting from CKD, slower progression of kidney impairment, prevention of end-stage renal failure, a decreased need for hemodialysis therapy, avoidance of dialysis-related side effects later on in the patient's life, improved quality of life and increased life expectancy."

The techniques that are currently available vary with respect to the type of result that can be expected from the assay: a mere qualitative demonstration of binding; the identification of response element sequences at high throughput; or a quantitative characterisation of affinities.

Very often, it represents the bottleneck of a successful integration of magnetoelectronic transducers with the biological receptors on its interface. Here is discussed how a thiolgold surface chemistry can be tailored and optimized in order to allow the biofunctionalization of a magnetoresistive biochip, preventing loss of viability by corrosion while improving its sensitivity. Two important parameters, type of buffer solution and salt concentration (globally ionic strength), were evaluated in the effectiveness of the sulfur-gold linkage and further influence on the biomolecular recognition between single stranded DNA molecules. A third, not less important variable under investigation was the blocking solution. Non-specific adsorption of magnetic labels to the sensing surface still is a major problem to be addressed. The effect of two well known blocking molecules (bovine serum albumin (BSA)) and thiolated polyethylene-glycol (SH-PEG)) on the prevention of non-specific adsorption of targets and labels are compared. The best conditions were selected using an optical microscopic characterization method. Optical images were analyzed for magnetic particles quantification and results presented as a percentage of surface coverage. The optimized protocol was further implemented on real magnetoresistive devices to assess its electric compatibility and bioassay performance. A good reproducibility (about 9% error) among different devices measuring the same target concentration was achieved. Also a reduced non-specific binding signal of 43 microV for non-complementary targets (30% complementarity) compares with a 500 microV for fully complementarity. A linear range on the biological detection of magnetically labeled target ssDNA oligonucleotides is demonstrated. Consequently, the limit of detection at the standard operational conditions of the device is situated at the picomolar range."

We performed trio WGS (≈40-fold) in parallel with CMA in 111 fetuses with structural or growth anomalies, and sequentially performed WES when CMA was negative (CMA plus WES). In comparison, WGS not only detected all pathogenic genetic variants in 22 diagnosed cases identified by CMA plus WES, yielding a diagnostic rate of 19.8% (22/110), but also provided additional and clinically significant information, including a case of balanced translocations and a case of intrauterine infection, which might not be detectable by CMA or WES. WGS also required less DNA (100 ng) as input and could provide a rapid turnaround time (TAT, 18 ± 6 days) compared with that (31 ± 8 days) of the CMA plus WES.

The immobilized ligands in these microarrays maintain the receptor-binding activities including those of lectins and antibodies according to the structures of their pendant carbohydrates for rapid analysis of a number of carbohydrate-recognition events within 30 h. This method facilitates the direct construction of otherwise difficult to obtain carbohydrate microarrays from underivatized glycans."

It affects 1-3% of individuals globally and in at least 30-50% of cases the etiology remains unexplained. The widespread use of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) in a clinical setting has allowed the identification of submicroscopic copy number variations (CNVs), throughout the genome, associated with neurodevelopmental phenotypes including ID/GDD. In this study we investigated the utility of CMA in the detection of CNVs in 106 patients with unexplained ID/DD, dysmorphism with or without multiple congenital anomalies (MCA). CMA study was carried out using Agilent 8×60K chips and Illumina Human CytoSNP-12 chips. Pathogenic CNVs were found in 15 (14.2%) patients. In these patients, CNVs on single chromosome were detected in 10 patients while 5 patients showed co-occurrence CNVs on two chromosomes. The size of these CNVs ranged between 322kb to 13Mb. The yield of pathogenic CNVs was similar for both mild and severe ID/GDD cases. One patient described in this paper is considered to harbour a likely pathogenic CNV with deletion in 17q22 region. Only few cases have been described in literature for 17q22 deletion and patient reported here was found to have an atypical deletion in 17q22 region (Case 90). This study re-affirms the view point that CMA is a powerful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of idiopathic ID/GDD patients irrespective of the degree of severity. Identifying pathogenic CNVs helps in counseling and prenatal diagnosis if desired."

There is abundant evidence indicating the added detection of pathogenic abnormalities with CMA in comparison to the traditional karyotyping, especially in fetuses with multiple or isolated ultrasound abnormalities such as congenital heart disease, increased nuchal translucency, or oral cleft. On the other hand, there is also a risk to detect variants of unknown significance, late-onset disorders, and variants in susceptibility loci. However, it has been shown that pregnant couples tend to prefer a maximum of information about the health of their unborn child.

NMF reduces the dimensionality of non-negative data by decomposing it into two smaller non-negative factors with physical interpretation for class discovery. The NMF algorithm, however, assumes a deterministic framework. In particular, the effect of the data noise on the stability of the factorization and the convergence of the algorithm are unknown. Collected data, on the other hand, is stochastic in nature due to measurement noise and sometimes inherent variability in the physical process. This paper presents new theoretical and applied developments to the problem of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). First, we generalize the deterministic NMF algorithm to include a general class of update rules that converges towards an optimal non-negative factorization. Second, we extend the NMF framework to the probabilistic case (PNMF). We show that the Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the non-negative factors is the solution to a weighted regularized non-negative matrix factorization problem. We subsequently derive update rules that converge towards an optimal solution. Third, we apply the PNMF to cluster and classify DNA microarrays data. The proposed PNMF is shown to outperform the deterministic NMF and the sparse NMF algorithms in clustering stability and classification accuracy."

Electrical readout systems have emerged as an alternative to conventional optical methods for microarray analysis thanks to its potential advantages like low-cost, low-power and easy miniaturization of the required instrumentation. In this work an automated electrical readout system for low-cost glass-slide microarrays is described. The system enables the simultaneous conductimetric detection of up to 36 biorecognition events by incorporating an array of interdigitated electrode transducers. A polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic structure has been designed that creates microwells over the transducers and incorporates the microfluidic channels required for filling and draining them with readout and cleaning solutions, thus making the readout process fully automated. Since the capture biomolecules are not immobilized on the transducer surface this readout system is reusable, in contrast to previously reported electrochemical microarrays. A low-density microarray based on a competitive enzymatic immunoassay for atrazine detection was used to test the performance of the readout system. The electrical assay shows a detection limit of 0.22±0.03 μg L(-1) similar to that obtained with fluorescent detection and allows the direct determination of the pesticide in polluted water samples.

This is achieved by directly interfacing the separation column to a micro T-junction, where the eluate stream is compartmentalized into picoliter droplets. This immediate compartmentalization prevents peak dispersion during eluate transport and conserves the chromatographic performance. Subsequently, nanoliter eluate fractions are collected at a rate of one fraction per second on a high-density microarray to retain the separation with high temporal resolution. Chromatographic separations of up to 45 min runtime can thus be archived on a single microarray possessing 2700 sample spots. The performance of this device is demonstrated by fractionating the separation of a tryptic digest of a known protein mixture onto the microarray chip and subsequently analyzing the sample archive using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Resulting peak widths are found to be significantly reduced compared to standard continuous flow spotting technologies as well as in comparison to a conventional nano-LC-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry interface. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantage of our high-definition nanofractionation device by applying two different MALDI matrices to all collected fractions in an alternating fashion. Since the information that is obtained from a MALDI-MS measurement depends on the choice of MALDI matrix, we can extract complementary information from neighboring spots containing almost identical composition but different matrices."

The spectrum and temporal secretion of cytokines are dramatically varied between cell phenotypes and even within the same phenotype. Multiparameter analysis of individual immune cell's cytokine secretion has always been a challenging and complicated process that needs special facilities in a laboratory setting. Herein, we present an ultrasimple method with high sensitivity and high robustness to quantify cytokine expression at the single-cell resolution. A microchip is developed based on poly(dimethylsiloxane) nanowells on sticky tape, while each nanowell is integrated with a DNA-antibody convertible microarray. Only pipetting is needed for the whole single-cell analysis process. The sensitivity of the assay is evaluated by measuring various concentrations of six recombinant cytokine proteins, which was found comparable to conventional methods. Once single cells are loaded to nanowells and incubated there, a Fluorinert FC-40 is used to isolate nanowells; so, cytokines from those cells are captured by separate microarrays. The rest of the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection process is also executed simply by pipetting of various reagents. This method is validated by measuring cytokine production from hundreds of single cells. It has simplified a typically sophisticated multiplex single-cell assay into an instrument-free, point-of-detection technology, and thus it may find a broad utility in clinical diagnostics."

Thus, the MGNT arrays may be used as a versatile platform for high-sensitive label-free optical biosensing."

From a computational point of view, the data is very different from that produced by the already established microarray technology, providing a new perspective on the samples under study and complementing microarray gene expression data. Software offering the integrated analysis of data from different technologies is of growing importance as new data emerge in systems biology studies. Mayday is an extensible platform for visual data exploration and interactive analysis and provides many methods for dissecting complex transcriptome datasets. We present Mayday SeaSight, an extension that allows to integrate data from different platforms such as deep sequencing and microarrays. It offers methods for computing expression values from mapped reads and raw microarray data, background correction and normalization and linking microarray probes to genomic coordinates. It is now possible to use Mayday's wealth of methods to analyze sequencing data and to combine data from different technologies in one analysis."

            "abstract": "Glycolipid-protein interactions are increasingly recognised as critical to numerous and diverse biological processes, including immune recognition, cell-cell signalling, pathogen adherence, and virulence factor binding. Previously, such carbohydrate-lectin interactions have been assessed in vitro largely by assaying protein binding against purified preparations of single glycolipids. Recent observations show that certain disease-associated autoantibodies and other lectins bind only to complexes formed by two different gangliosides. However, investigating such 1:1 glycolipid complexes can prove technically arduous. To address this problem, we have developed a semi-automated system for assaying lectin binding to large numbers of glycolipid complexes simultaneously. This employs an automated thin-layer chromatography sampler. Single glycolipids and their heterodimeric complexes are prepared in microvials. The autosampler is then used to print reproducible arrays of glycolipid complexes onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes affixed to glass slides. A printing density of 300 antigen spots per slide is achievable. Following overnight drying, these arrays can then be probed with the lectin(s) of interest. Detection of binding is by way of a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody driving a chemiluminescent reaction rendered on radiographic film. Image analysis software can then be used to measure signal intensity for quantification."

In this paper, several image analysis methods are evaluated for their ability to accurately enumerate single molecules bound to a microarray spot. Crucially, protein abundance in single cells can vary significantly and may span several orders of magnitude. This poses a challenge to single molecule image analysis. In order to quantitatively assess the performance of each method, synthetic image datasets are generated with known ground truth whereby the number of single molecules varies over 5 orders of magnitude with a range of signal to noise ratios. Experiments were performed on synthetic datasets whereby the number of single molecules per spot corresponds to realistic single cell distributions whose ground truth summary statistics are known. The methods of image analysis are assessed in their ability to accurately estimate the distribution parameters. It is shown that super-resolution image analysis methods can significantly improve counting accuracy and better cope with single molecule congestion. The results highlight the challenge posed by quantitative single cell analysis and the implications to performing such analyses using microarray based approaches are discussed."

However, the relationship among sample genotyping efficiency (call rate per individual), accuracy of SNP genotypes, and DNA quality (integrity, concentration, and mixture of DNA, i.e., chimerism) remains unknown. We determined the effect of DNA quality on call rate per individual and accuracy of SNP genotypes using artificial DNA samples of various qualities. Integrity and concentration of DNA were less sensitive to call rate per individual and accuracy of genotyping in the SNP array. Chimerism strongly affected call rate per individual and accuracy of SNP genotypes. Artificial chimerism experiments showed that relative to unmixed DNA, the genotypic matching error (%) of mixed DNAs linearly increased with mix ratio, whereas the call rate per individual in some samples at 50% mix ratio was >0.95. However, individuals with higher chimerism were readily identified based on standard deviation of B-allele frequency (BAF) and BAF distribution across the genome from SNP array data. Thus, we effectively managed the balance by maximizing genotyping accuracy and minimizing the number of samples for re-genotyping by using quality control for combining call rate per individual with BAF."

The surrounding glass is backfilled by a protein-repellent layer to prevent nonspecific adsorption. Moreover, bifunctional surfaces are created, whereby a second ligand is presented on the background, which is frequently a requirement for simulating complex cellular functions involving more than one key ligand.

Genetically, the closely related strains within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex which cause disease are well-characterized but there is an urgent need better to understand their phenotypes. To search rapidly for metabolic differences, a working method using Biolog Phenotype MicroArray analysis was developed. Of 380 substrates surveyed, 71 permitted tetrazolium dye reduction, the readout over 7 days in the method. By looking for ≥5-fold differences in dye reduction, 12 substrates differentiated M. tuberculosis H37Rv and Mycobacterium bovis AF2122/97. H37Rv and a Beijing strain of M. tuberculosis could also be distinguished in this way, as could field strains of M. bovis; even pairs of strains within one spoligotype could be distinguished by 2 to 3 substrates. Cluster analysis gave three clear groups: H37Rv, Beijing, and all the M. bovis strains. The substrates used agreed well with prior knowledge, though an unexpected finding that AF2122/97 gave greater dye reduction than H37Rv with hexoses was investigated further, in culture flasks, revealing that hexoses and Tween 80 were synergistic for growth and used simultaneously rather than in a diauxic fashion. Potential new substrates for growth media were revealed, too, most promisingly N-acetyl glucosamine. Osmotic and pH arrays divided the mycobacteria into two groups with different salt tolerance, though in contrast to the substrate arrays the groups did not entirely correlate with taxonomic differences. More interestingly, these arrays suggested differences between the amines used by the M. tuberculosis complex and enteric bacteria in acid tolerance, with some hydrophobic amino acids being highly effective. In contrast, γ-aminobutyrate, used in the enteric bacteria, had no effect in the mycobacteria. This study proved principle that Phenotype MicroArrays can be used with slow-growing pathogenic mycobacteria and already has generated interesting data worthy of further investigation."

Diverse platforms to immobilize glycans on glass slides for subsequent probing of the specificities of glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) have evolved. It has been suggested that high local glycan density on microarrays is crucial for detecting low-affinity interactions. To determine the influence of printing efficacy on GBP binding, we compared N-hydroxyl succinimide (NHS)-ester activated glass slides from three different manufacturers and evaluated two different printing buffers. Large differences in binding efficacies of Concanavalin A, peanut agglutinin, and Ricinus communis agglutinin 120 were observed. On some slides, low affinity interactions were missed altogether. Addition of polyethylenglycol (PEG) 400 to the printing buffer significantly enhanced the sensitivity of the binding assays. After monitoring printing efficacy over prolonged printing times, substantial effects resulting from progressing hydrolysis of the NHS-esters during the printing run on one type of slides were found. Printing efficiency of glycans strongly depends on the type of NHS-ester activated slides, the printing buffer, and the printing time.

In such cases, RNA must be amplified to have enough material for microarray labeling and hybridization. This protocol generates amplified antisense RNA (aRNA) from limited quantities of total RNA. It is designed around maximizing yield and product length while minimizing template-independent side reactions. Template-independent reactions compete with the desired template-dependent reaction, an undesirable situation that becomes more severe as less RNA template is used. Amplification products dominated by template-independent product result in greatly reduced sensitivity and compression of differences in microarray hybridization experiments. Most notably, the oligo(dT) primer used in reverse transcription (RT) yields a high-molecular-weight product in the in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction independent of any cDNA template. This protocol therefore limits the amount of primer used by using small cDNA synthesis volumes. In addition, high-molecular-weight, template-independent product is generated in the presence of biotinylated NTPs and the absence of any polymer when excessive amounts of T7 RNA polymerase activity are used. Template-dependent product of questionable molecular weight and limited functionality in downstream reactions can also be produced with excessive T7 RNA polymerase activity. Essentially, more yield is not always better. Here, a single round of amplification typically results in a fivefold to 20-fold mass conversion of starting material. If the first-round aRNA is used as a template for a second round of amplification, 200- to 400-fold amplification is typical."

            "abstract": "Tumor spheroids or microtumors are important 3D in vitro tumor models that closely resemble a tumor's in vivo \"microenvironment\" compared to 2D cell culture. Microtumors are widely applied in the fields of fundamental cancer research, drug discovery, and precision medicine. In precision medicine tumor spheroids derived from patient tumor cells represent a promising system for drug sensitivity and resistance testing. Established and commonly used platforms for routine screenings of cell spheroids, based on microtiter plates of 96- and 384-well formats, require relatively large numbers of cells and compounds, and often lead to the formation of multiple spheroids per well. In this study, an application of the Droplet Microarray platform, based on hydrophilic-superhydrophobic patterning, in combination with the method of hanging droplet, is demonstrated for the formation of highly miniaturized single-spheroid-microarrays. Formation of spheroids from several commonly used cancer cell lines in 100 nL droplets starting with as few as 150 cells per spheroid within 24-48 h is demonstrated. Established methodology carries a potential to be adopted for routine workflows of high-throughput compound screening in 3D cancer spheroids or microtumors, which is crucial for the fields of fundamental cancer research, drug discovery, and precision medicine."

            "abstract": "Fetal cerebral ventriculomegaly (VM) is defined as an enlargement of the lateral ventricles of the developing fetal brain. It is diagnosed when the width of one or both lateral ventricles, measured at the level of the atrium, is ≥10 mm. VM is defined as mild when the atrial width is 10-15 mm and severe when >15 mm. VM is a non-specific sonographic sign which is common to various pathological conditions. It is frequently associated with neural and extraneural anomalies. The rate of associated malformations is higher (≥60%) in severe VM and lower (about 40%) in cases of mild VM. When an abnormality is associated with severe VM the incidence of aneuploidies is high (>15%); in isolated mild VM the mean value of aneuploidy is 2.7%. The rate of infections in severe VM is 10-20%, in mild forms 1-5%. Since the prognosis in cases of VM depends mainly on the associated anomalies, a careful examination of the fetus, particularly of the brain, is mandatory. Magnetic resonance imaging can be a useful diagnostic tool complementary to ultrasound in order to recognize subtle brain anomalies, such as neuronal migration and proliferation disorders."

Assuming the experimental design minimized sources of bias, and the analytical technology was reliable, precise, and accurate, how does the experimentalist determine which endpoints are meaningfully different between the groups? Comparison of two population means for individual analysis measurements is the most common statistical problem associated with microarray data analysis. This chapter focuses on the hands-on procedures using SAS software to describe how to choose statistical methods to find the statistically significantly different endpoints between two groups of data generated from reverse phase protein microarrays. The four methods outlined are: (a) two-sample t-test, (b) Wilcoxon rank sum test, (c) one-sample t-test, and (d) Wilcoxon signed rank test. Two sample t-test is used for two independently normally distributed groups. One-sample t-test is used for a normally distributed difference of paired observations. Wilcoxon rank sum test is considered a nonparametric version of the two-sample t-test, and Wilcoxon signed rank test is considered a nonparametric version of the one-sample t-test."

            "abstract": "The pathophysiology of congenital and neonatal hydrocephalus is not well understood although the prognosis for patients with this disorder is far from optimal. A major obstacle to advancing our knowledge of the causes of this disorder and the cellular responses that accompany it is the multifactorial nature of hydrocephalus. Not only is the epidemiology varied and complex, but the injury mechanisms are numerous and overlapping. Nevertheless, several conclusions can be made with certainty: the age of onset strongly influences the degree of impairment; injury severity is dependent on the magnitude and duration of ventriculomegaly; the primary targets are periventricular axons, myelin, and microvessels; cerebrovascular injury mechanisms are prominent; gliosis and neuroinflammation play major roles; some but not all changes are preventable by draining cerebrospinal fluid with shunts and third ventriculostomies; cellular plasticity and physiological compensation probably occur but this is a major under-studied area; and pharmacologic interventions are promising. Rat and mouse models have provided important insights into the pathogenesis of congenital and neonatal hydrocephalus. Ependymal denudation of the ventricular lining appears to affect the development of neural progenitors exposed to cerebrospinal fluid, and alterations of the subcommissural organ influence the patency of the cerebral aqueduct. Recently these impairments have been observed in patients with fetal-onset hydrocephalus, so experimental findings are beginning to be corroborated in humans. These correlations, coupled with advanced genetic manipulations in animals and successful pharmacologic interventions, support the view that improved treatments for congenital and neonatal hydrocephalus are on the horizon."

Although NGS platforms provide a cost-effective way to discover genome-wide variants from a single experiment, variants discovered by NGS need follow up validation due to the high error rates associated with various sequencing chemistries. Recently, whole exome sequencing has been proposed as an affordable option compared to whole genome runs but it still requires follow up validation of all the novel exomic variants. Customarily, a consensus approach is used to overcome the systematic errors inherent to the sequencing technology, alignment and post alignment variant detection algorithms. However, the aforementioned approach warrants the use of multiple sequencing chemistry, multiple alignment tools, multiple variant callers which may not be viable in terms of time and money for individual investigators with limited informatics know-how. Biologists often lack the requisite training to deal with the huge amount of data produced by NGS runs and face difficulty in choosing from the list of freely available analytical tools for NGS data analysis. Hence, there is a need to customise the NGS data analysis pipeline to preferentially retain true variants by minimising the incidence of false positives and make the choice of right analytical tools easier. To this end, we have sampled different freely available tools used at the alignment and post alignment stage suggesting the use of the most suitable combination determined by a simple framework of pre-existing metrics to create significant datasets."

Of paramount importance for the success of any glycan-targeting reagent is the ability to specifically recognize the target among the plethora of different glycans that exist in the human body. The preeminent technique for defining specificity is glycan array screening, in which a glycan-binding protein (GBP) can be simultaneously screened against multiple glycans. Glycan array screening has provided unparalleled insight into GBP specificity, but data interpretation suffers from difficulties in identifying false-negative binding arising from altered glycan presentation, associated with the linker used to conjugate the glycan to the surface. In this work, we model the structure and dynamics of the linkers employed in the glycan arrays developed by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics. The modeling takes into account the physical presence and surface polarity of the array, and provides a structure-based rationalization of false-negative results arising from the so-called \"linker effect.\" The results also serve as a guide for interpreting glycan array screening data in a biological context; in particular, we show that attempts to employ natural amino acids as linkers may be prone to unexpected artifacts compromising glycan recognition."

However, while Fluorescence Interference Contrast (FLIC), which modulates the fluorescence by materials-based parameters, has been used for decades to measure biomolecular interactions at nanometer-precision, e.g., for the study of molecular motors and membrane processes, it has been seldom used for high throughput or diagnostic microdevices. Moreover, the amplification of both the fluorescence signal, modulated by vertically-nano-calibrated structures, and the signal/background, modulated by laterally-micro-calibrated structures, has not been explored. To address this synergy, structures comprising optically transparent silicon oxide, tens of micrometers-wide and with thicknesses in the low hundreds of nanometers, which are able to promote the formation of standing waves if patterned on a reflective material, have been designed, fabricated and tested, for the use in DNA- and protein arrays. The light emitted by a fluorophore placed on top of the structures and reflected by a bottom mirror surface, e.g., silicon, platinum, is physically constrained to a region defined lithographically, both vertically and laterally, i.e., micro-pillars and -wells, resulting in an accurate identification and quantification of fluorescence.

A specialized UV microscope was developed to obtain fluorescent images of microarrays in the UV wavelengths and to measure the fluorescence intensity of individual microarray elements. UV fluorescence intensity of BSA immobilized in microarray gel elements increased linearly with increased BSA amount with sensitivity of 0.6 ng. Real-time interaction curves between the DNA-binding domain of the NFATc1 transcription factor (NFATc1-DBD) and synthetic hairpin-forming oligodeoxyribonucleotides immobilized within 0.2 nL microarray gel elements at a concentration 5 × 10(-5) M and higher were obtained. The UV fluorescence intensities of microarray gel elements containing NFATc1-DBD-DNA complexes at equilibrium allowed the estimation of the equilibrium binding constant for complex formation.

Prof. Grandin underwent chromosomal microarray analysis, whole exome sequencing, and whole genome sequencing, as well as a comprehensive clinical and family history intake. The raw data were analyzed in order to identify possible genotype-phenotype correlations. Genetic testing identified variants in three genes (SHANK2, ALX1, and RELN) that are candidate risk factors for ASD. We identified variants in MEFV and WNT10A, reported to be disease-associated in previous studies, which are likely to contribute to some of her additional clinical features. Moreover, candidate variants in genes encoding metabolic enzymes and transporters were identified, some of which suggest potential therapies.

This direction of research is inspired by biological systems where multiple pores with different functionalities embedded in a cell membrane transmit external signals and underlie all physiological processes. In this manuscript, we describe the modeling of ion transport through small arrays of nanopores consisting of 3, 6, and 9 nanopores and an integrated gate electrode placed on the membrane surface next to one pore opening. We show that by tuning the gate voltage and strategically placing nanopores with nonlinear current-voltage characteristics, the local signal at the gate affects ionic transport through all nanopores in the array. Conditions were identified when the same gate voltage induced opposite rectification properties of neighboring nanopores. We also demonstrate that an ionic diode embedded in a nanopore array can modulate transport properties of neighboring pores even without a gate voltage. The results are explained by the role of concentration polarization and overlapping depletion zones on one side of the membrane. The modeling presented here is intended to become an inspiration to future experiments to create nanopore arrays that can transduce signals in space and time."

This method can detect a large number of taxonomic groups in several samples simultaneously within a relatively short time and has the potential for incorporation in automated remote sensing pipelines. In this study we developed and tested a microarray for eukaryotes in marine sediments. The probes were designed to target 18S rRNA OTUs obtained through metabarcoding of marine sediments. The resulting microarray was tested using both a spiked sample consisting of 50 plasmid-clones and further, samples of genomic DNA extracted from marine sediments. We developed a filtration pipeline to eliminate noise and reduce the number of false positives, making it possible to detect and quantify most of the OTUs with ≥ 0.1% abundance in the spiked sample. Our data indicated that the microarray was specific at higher taxonomic levels. However, the specificity decreased with increasing sequence similarity suggesting cross-hybridization between closely related OTUs.

The use of CMA technology in prenatal diagnosis is emerging and promises higher sensitivity for several highly penetrant, clinically severe microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. Genetic counseling complements the diagnostic testing with CMA, given the presence of CNVs of uncertain clinical significance, incomplete penetrance, and variable expressivity in some cases. While oligonucleotide arrays with high-density exonic coverage remain the gold standard for the detection of CNVs, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays allow for detection of consanguinity and most cases of uniparental disomy and provide a higher sensitivity to detect low-level mosaic aneuploidies."

However, many nonviral transfection reagents have relatively low transfection efficiency. It is hypothesized that by treating cells with small molecules, the transfection efficiency can be improved. However, in order to identify such transfection-enhancing molecules, thousands of molecules must be tested. Current high-throughput screening (HTS) technologies based on microtiter plates are not suitable for such screenings due to the prohibitively high costs of reagents and operation. Here, the use of the droplet microarray (DMA) platform to screen 774 FDA-approved drugs with CHO-K1, Jurkat and HEK293T cells is reported. The volume of individual aqueous compartments is 20 nL, requiring 0.84 mL of cell suspension and 200 pmoles of each drug (total 0.02 moles) to perform the screening. Thus, the requirement for cells and reagents is 2500 times less than that for the same experiment performed in 384-well plates. The results reveal the potential of the DMA platform as a more cost-effective and less labor-intensive approach to HTS. Furthermore, an increase (approximately two- to fivefold) in transfection efficiency is achieved by treating cells with some molecules. This study clearly demonstrates the potential of the DMA platform for miniaturization of biochemical and cellular HTS."

The high-content nature of the data derived from such recordings can be used to infer effects of compounds or disease states on a variety of important neural functions, including network synchrony. Historically, synchrony of networks in vitro has been assessed either by determination of correlation coefficients (e.g. Pearson's correlation), by statistics estimated from cross-correlation histograms between pairs of active electrodes, and/or by pairwise mutual information and related measures. The present study examines the application of Normalized Multiinformation (NMI) as a scalar measure of shared information content in a multivariate network that is robust with respect to changes in network size. Theoretical simulations are designed to investigate NMI as a measure of complexity and synchrony in a developing network relative to several alternative approaches. The NMI approach is applied to these simulations and also to data collected during exposure of in vitro neural networks to neuroactive compounds during the first 12 days in vitro, and compared to other common measures, including correlation coefficients and mean firing rates of neurons. NMI is shown to be more sensitive to developmental effects than first order synchronous and nonsynchronous measures of network complexity. Finally, NMI is a scalar measure of global (rather than pairwise) mutual information in a multivariate network, and hence relies on less assumptions for cross-network comparisons than historical approaches."

Here, we investigated the ability of optical genome mapping (OGM) to detect known constitutional chromosomal aberrations. Ultra-high-molecular-weight DNA was isolated from 85 blood or cultured cells and processed via OGM. A de novo genome assembly was performed followed by structural variant and CNV calling and annotation, and results were compared to known aberrations from standard-of-care tests (karyotype, FISH, and/or CNV microarray). In total, we analyzed 99 chromosomal aberrations, including seven aneuploidies, 19 deletions, 20 duplications, 34 translocations, six inversions, two insertions, six isochromosomes, one ring chromosome, and four complex rearrangements. Several of these variants encompass complex regions of the human genome involved in repeat-mediated microdeletion/microduplication syndromes. High-resolution OGM reached 100% concordance compared to standard assays for all aberrations with non-centromeric breakpoints. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the ability of OGM to detect nearly all types of chromosomal aberrations. We also suggest suited filtering strategies to prioritize clinically relevant aberrations and discuss future improvements.

In this study, we investigated the incidence and risk factors for PTH and the indication for and outcome after shunt treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      In this retrospective study, 836 TBI patients, treated at our neurointensive care (NIC) unit at Uppsala university hospital, Sweden, between 2008 and 2018, were included. Demography, admission status, radiology, treatments, and outcome variables were evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Post-traumatic ventriculomegaly occurred in 46% of all patients at NIC discharge. Twenty-nine (3.5%) patients received a VP-shunt. Lower GCS M at admission, greater amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, decompressive craniectomy (DC), and ventriculomegaly at NIC discharge were risk factors for receiving a VP-shunt. Fourteen of the PTH patients showed impeded recovery or low-pressure hydrocephalus symptoms, of whom 13 experienced subjective clinical improvement after shunt treatment. Five PTH patients showed deterioration in consciousness, of whom four improved following shunt treatment. Five DC patients received a shunt due to subdural hygromas (n =2) or external brain herniation (n = 3), of whom two patients improved following treatment. Five patients were vegetative with concurrent ventriculomegaly and these patients did not have any positive shunt response. Altogether, 19 (66%) PTH patients improved after shunt surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Post-traumatic ventriculomegaly was common, but few developed symptomatic PTH and received a VP-shunt. Patients with low-pressure hydrocephalus symptoms had the best shunt response, whereas patients with suspected vegetative state exhibited a minimal shunt response."

The developed MCA is designed for neuronal network analysis which has been studied by the co-authors using the Micro Electrode Arrays (MEA) system, and employs the principles of extracellular recordings. A prerequisite for extracellular recordings with good signal-to-noise ratio is a tight contact between cells and electrodes. The MCA described herein has the following advantages. The electrodes integrated around individual micro channels are electrically isolated to enable parallel multipoint recording. Reliable clamping of a targeted cell through micro channels is expected to improve the cellular selectivity and the attachment between the cell and the electrode toward steady electrophysiological recordings. We cultured hippocampal neurons on the developed MCA. As a result, the spontaneous and evoked spike potentials could be recorded by sucking and clamping the cells at multiple points. In this paper, we describe the design and fabrication of the MCA and the successful electrophysiological recordings leading to the development of an effective cellular network analysis device."

Sections generated are suitable for all in situ techniques, such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridisation, using essentially the same protocols as are used in conventional sections. The principle advantages of TMAs are that they save valuable biological material and ensure more reproducible reaction conditions while at the same time reducing re-agent costs and laboratory processing.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 45 subjects with isolated mild fetal ventriculomegaly (IMVM). The calcarine sulcus development was divided into three categories based on the depth; Grade 1 (undeveloped), Grade 2 (underdeveloped), and Grade 3 (fully developed), and its correlation with fetal ventriculomegaly was analyzed based on Spearman's partial rank correlation test. Based on this analysis, the width of left and right lateral ventricles showed significant downward trend with the calcarine sulcus maturation [undeveloped (Left 13.88 ± 2.70 mm, Right 14.27 ± 3.13 mm) → underdeveloped (Left 12.95 ± 1.93 mm, Right 11.93 ± 2.24 mm) → fully developed (Left 11.06 ± 2.10 mm, Right 10.42 ± 2.10 mm)] (FLeft = 5.12, P = 0.01; FRight = 10.72, P = 1.73 × 10-4 ).

An efficient and selective immobilization technique of substances on the surface is essential for successful construction of microarrays. Although a variety of immobilization methods have been exploited to prepare microarrays over the past decade, a superior technique needs to be developed for diverse applications. Recently, an efficient and simple method that relies on selective reactions between the hydrazide conjugated to substances and the epoxide derivatized on the solid surface was developed to fabricate chemical microarrays. Reactions between hydrazides with epoxides are highly selective in that they take place even in the presence of other potent nucleophiles such as amines and thiols. This technique is utilized to immobilize various substances such as small molecules, carbohydrates, and peptides to glass surfaces. The microarrays constructed by this immobilization method are used to evaluate protein binding to carbohydrates, peptides, and small molecules. In addition, the microarrays are also employed to determine binding affinities between proteins and binding partners as well as profiling of enzyme activities."

            "abstract": "Salmonellosis in the United States is one of the most costly foodborne diseases. Given that Salmonella can originate from a wide variety of environments, reduction of this organism at all stages of poultry production is critical. Salmonella species can encounter various environmental stress conditions that can dramatically influence their survival and virulence. Previous knowledge of Salmonella species genomic regulation of metabolism and physiology in relation to poultry is based on limited information of a few well-characterized genes. Consequently, although there is some information about environmental signals that control Salmonella growth and pathogenesis, much still remains unknown. Advancements in DNA sequencing technologies revolutionized the way bacteria were studied and molecular tools such as microarrays have subsequently been used for comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of Salmonella. With microarray analysis, the expression levels of each single gene in the Salmonella genome can be directly assessed and previously unknown genetic systems that are required for Salmonella growth and survival in the poultry production cycle can be elucidated. This represents an opportunity for development of novel approaches for limiting Salmonella establishment in all phases of poultry production. In this review, recent advances in transcriptome-microarray technologies that are facilitating a better understanding of Salmonella biology in poultry production and processing are discussed."

The recent application of genomic tools including microarrays, next-generation sequencing approaches, and epigenetics can significantly contribute to decipher the molecular mechanisms involved in the processes of sex determination and sex differentiation. However, in fish, these studies are complicated by the fact that these processes depend, perhaps to a larger extent when compared to other vertebrates, on the interplay of genetic and environmental influences. Here, we review the advances made so far, taking into account different experimental approaches, and illustrate some technical complications deriving from the fact that as development progresses it becomes more and more difficult to distinguish whether changes in gene expression or DNA methylation patterns are the cause or the consequence of such developmental events. Finally, we suggest some avenues for further research in both model fish species and fish species facing specific problems within an aquaculture context."

Massively parallel sequencing has identified a panoply of in-frame expressed fusion genes, but early reports suggest that the majority of these are present at very low prevalence or are private events. Conventional methods for the identification of recurrent expressed fusion genes in large cohorts of cancers (eg fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)) are time consuming and prone to artifacts. Here, we describe a novel high-throughput strategy for the detection of recurrent fusion genes in cancer based on the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. Fusion genes were initially identified by massively parallel sequencing of breast cancer cell lines. For each fusion gene, two Sequenom probes were designed. Primary human breast cancers and cancer cell lines were interrogated for 10 fusion genes. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the MassARRAY method were then determined using FISH and qRT-PCR as the 'gold standard.' By combining two probes per fusion gene, the negative and positive predictive values were 100 and 71.4%, respectively. All fusion genes identified by massively parallel sequencing were accurately detected. No recurrent fusion genes were found. The MassARRAY-based approach described here may, therefore, be employed as a high-throughput screening tool for known fusion genes in human cancer. In keeping with other highly sensitive assays, further refinement of this technique is necessary to reduce the number of false-positive results."

Many of these details can be determined by the strategic use of metaphase FISH. FISH is a single-cell technique, so it can identify low-frequency chromosome abnormalities, and it can determine which chromosome abnormalities occur in the same or different clonal populations. These are important considerations in cancer. Metaphase chromosomes are intact, so information about abnormalities of the chromosome homologues is preserved.

The neurological outcomes of subsequent live births were analysed to identify factors associated with developmental delay.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 84 cases (ie, pregnant women and their fetuses) included, 46 (54.8%) exhibited isolated fetal ventriculomegaly, 55 (65.5%) had mild cerebral ventriculomegaly, and 29 (34.5%) had moderate or severe cerebral ventriculomegaly. Overall, 20% (14/70) of cases had chromosomal abnormalities. Moreover, 12% (3/25) of mild isolated ventriculomegaly cases had abnormal karyotype or CMA results. The CMA provided an incremental diagnostic yield of 8.6% (6/70), compared with conventional karyotyping; 4.3% exhibited pathogenic variants and 4.3% exhibited variants of uncertain significance. Among the 53 live births in the cohort, fewer cases of mild isolated ventriculomegaly were associated with developmental delay than more severe isolated ventriculomegaly (9.7% vs 41.7%, P<0.03).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Chromosomal microarray analysis testing should be offered to all women with fetal cerebral ventriculomegaly, including women with isolated mild ventriculomegaly.

In this study, four anionic conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) with a common poly(p-pheynylene ethynylene) (PPE) backbone and varying pendant ionic side chains were designed. The conjugation length, repeat unit pattern, and ionic side chain composition were the main factors affecting the fluorescence patterns of CPE polymers in response to the addition of different metal ions. Eight metal ions, including Pb(2+), Hg(2+), Fe(3+), Cr(3+), Cu(2+), Mn(2+), Ni(2+), and Co(2+), categorized as water contaminants by the Environmental Protection Agency, were selected as analytes in this study. Fluorescence intensity response patterns of the four-PPE sensor array toward each of the metal ions were recorded, analyzed, and transformed into canonical scores using linear discrimination analysis (LDA), which permitted clear differentiation between metal ions using both two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphs. In particular, the array could readily differentiate between eight toxic metal ions in separate aqueous solutions at 100 nM. Our four-PPE sensor array also provides a practical application to quantify Pb(2+) and Hg(2+) concentrations in blind samples within a specific concentration range."

In addition to all the features of a suspension based assay technology, our technology offers a rewritable label. This has the potential to be truly revolutionary by opening up the possibility of generating, on chip, extensive labelled molecular libraries.

Usually, microarray substrates are entirely modified with coatings able to bind, covalently or not, bioprobes. Here we present a new, fully automated approach for the immobilization of biomolecules, based on the deposition of pL amounts of water solutions of DMA based copolymers on an uncoated surface, followed by the deposition, on the same spot, of the probe. Starting from a common precursor, polymers with different characteristics and functionalities are obtained by post-polymerization modification and by combining different monomers during the synthesis. This strategy, allows to functionalize and tailor the surface properties of discrete areas of the same array with different chemistries, that coexist on a single substrate. As a consequence, probes with different functionalities are bound simultaneously to neutral, positively, negatively charged, hydrophobic, hydrophilic polymers, in micrometer-sized spots. The proposed polymer array, applicable to both DNA or protein, offers advantages in terms of time and costs reduction, since pretreatment and coating steps are totally avoided, and the requested polymer amount is extremely low. Moreover, it provides a strategy perfectly suitable for miniaturization applicable to integrated biosensors or Lab-on-a-chip devices."

However, quantification and analysis of microarray data have been a challenge. Previously, by taking into account translational and rotational diffusion of the target DNA, we have shown that the rate of hybridization depends on its size. Here, by mathematical modeling of surface diffusion of transcript, we show that the dynamics of hybridization on DNA microarray surface is inherently oscillatory and the amplitude of oscillation depends on fluid velocity. We found that high fluid velocity enhances the signal without affecting the background, and reduces the oscillation, thereby reducing likelihood of inter- and intra-experiment variability. We further show that a strong probe reduces dependence of signal-to-noise ratio on probe strength, decreasing inter-microarray variability. On the other hand, weaker probes are required for SNP detection. Therefore, we recommend high fluid velocity and strong probes for all microarray applications except determination of SNPs. For SNP detection, we recommend high fluid velocity with weak probe on the spot. We also recommend a surface with high adsorption and desorption rates of transcripts."

In particular, when preparing microarray gene expression data from multiple cohorts, array platforms, or batches for later analyses, batch effects can have confounding effects, inducing spurious differences between study groups. Many methods and tools exist for removing batch effects from data. However, when study groups are not evenly distributed across batches, actual group differences may induce apparent batch differences, in which case batch adjustments may bias, usually deflate, group differences. Some tools therefore have the option of preserving the difference between study groups, e.g. using a two-way ANOVA model to simultaneously estimate both group and batch effects.

Limits of Detection (LoD) of 18 μg mL-1, 88 μg mL-1 and 1 μM (6 μg mL-1) have been respectively obtained for CRP, IL6 and miRNA-16 in individual assays, with high accuracy and reproducibility. The multiplexing capabilities have also been assessed with the simultaneous analysis of both protein biomarkers."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Hydrocephalus is commonly associated with myelomeningocele (MMC). Indication and timing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting are still a topic of discussion. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the analysis of prenatal cerebral imaging studies could provide information that is predictive of the necessity of CSF shunting in the postnatal period.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      Among 73 infants operated on because of MMC between January 2003 and June 2020, 50 had undergone prenatal and postnatal MRI studies and were considered for analysis. For each patient, frontal horn width, atrial ventricle diameter, third ventricle diameter, and subarachnoid spaces (sinocortical width, craniocortical width, and the interhemispheric width) have been measured on prenatal, postnatal, and a follow-up MRI study. The need of CSF shunting device placement in relation to prenatal and early postnatal MRI data was investigated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 50 infants, 31 (62%) developed a progressive hydrocephalus. Of these, 30 needed a CSF shunt and the majority of them (n=29) was operated on within 28 days after birth. One patient needed CSF shunt implantation at 45 days after birth and one child developed a late progressive hydrocephalus, successfully treated by ETV alone, at 14.2 months of age. All patients with an atrial ventricle diameter greater than 1.9 cm and a 3rd ventricle diameter larger than 0.3 cm on antenatal third trimester imaging have undergone CSF shunting within 1 month after birth. Conversely, all the children that did not undergo a CSF shunt placement showed an atrial cerebral ventricle diameter inferior to 1.2 cm and a 3rd ventricle width < 0.3 cm on antenatal imaging. Frontal horn width and subarachnoid CSF spaces' evolution did not seem to play a role.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The prenatal MRI assessment of the associated prenatal ventriculomegaly in MMC provides parameters that have a predictive value heralding the probability of a CSF diversion procedure after birth. In the same way, the analysis of intrauterine MRI studies may identify those subjects that are less at risk of developing a progressive hydrocephalus after birth, therefore encouraging a more cautious attitude towards the early implantation of CSF shunting devices in the current clinical practice."

Microfluidic platforms work at the scale comparable to cell diameter and is suitable for single-cell manipulation. Here we present a microfluidic trapping array which is able to rapidly and deterministically trap single-cells in highly-packed microwells. This chapter first describes the design and fabrication protocols of the trapping array, and then presents its two representative applications: single-cell mRNA probing when integrated with a dielectrophoretic nanotweezer (DENT), and live-cell real-time imaging when combined with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). As the single-cell trapping efficiency is determined by the channel design instead of the flow rate, this trapping array can be coupled with different microfluidic sample processing units with different flow rates for various single-cell analyses."

Three siblings were found to have ventriculomegaly at early gestation; postnatally, there was no acquisition of developmental milestones, and the muscles of the children were dystrophic. Plasma and CSF lactate levels were normal, but the activities of mitochondrial complex I and IV were markedly decreased. Using linkage analysis in the family, followed by whole exome sequencing of a single patient, we identified a pathogenic mutation in the AIFM1 gene which segregated with the disease state and was absent in 86 anonymous controls. This is the second report of a mutation in the AIFM1 gene, extending the clinical spectrum to include prenatal ventriculomegaly and underscores the importance of AIF for complex I assembly. In summary, linkage analysis followed by exome sequencing of a single patient is a cost-effective approach for the identification of disease causing mutations in small non-consanguineous families."

A total of 3000 prenatal samples were processed in parallel using both whole-genome CMA and conventional karyotyping. The indications for prenatal testing included: advanced maternal age, maternal serum screening test abnormality, abnormal ultrasound findings, known abnormal fetal karyotype, parental anxiety, family history of a genetic condition and cell culture failure. The use of CMA resulted in an increased detection rate regardless of the indication for analysis. This was evident in high risk groups (abnormal ultrasound findings and abnormal fetal karyotype), in which the percentage of detection was 5.8% (7/120), and also in low risk groups, such as advanced maternal age (6/1118, 0.5%), and parental anxiety (11/1674, 0.7%). A total of 24 (0.8%) fetal conditions would have remained undiagnosed if only a standard karyotype had been performed. Importantly, 17 (0.6%) of such findings would have otherwise been overlooked if CMA was offered only to high risk pregnancies.The results of this study suggest that more widespread CMA testing of fetuses would result in a higher detection of clinically relevant chromosome abnormalities, even in low risk pregnancies. Our findings provide substantial evidence for the introduction of CMA as a first-line diagnostic test for all pregnant women undergoing invasive prenatal testing, regardless of risk factors."

The patients were assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 had ventriculomegaly with periventricular lucency (PVL), and raised intracranial pressure (ICP) 2.1% (10/500).

To determine the role of UTX (also known as KDM6A), a demethylase of histone H3K27, in neural development, we generated Utx-deficient mice in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). Since Utx is an X chromosome-specific gene, the genotypes are sex-dependent; female mice lose both Utx alleles (UtxΔ/Δ ), and male mice lose one Utx allele yet retain one Uty allele, the counterpart of Utx on the Y chromosome (UtxΔ/Uty ). We found that UtxΔ/Δ mice exhibited fetal ventriculomegaly and died soon after birth. Immunofluorescence staining and EdU labeling revealed a significant increase in NSPCs and a significant decrease in intermediate-progenitor and differentiated neural cells. Molecular analyses revealed the downregulation of pathways related to DNA replication and increased H3K27me3 levels around the transcription start sites in UtxΔ/Δ NSPCs. These results indicate that UTX globally regulates the expression of genes required for proper neural development in NSPCs, and UTX deficiency leads to impaired cell cycle exit, reduced differentiation, and neonatal death. Interestingly, although UtxΔ/Uty mice survived the postnatal period, most died of hydrocephalus, a clinical feature of Kabuki syndrome, a congenital anomaly involving UTX mutations. Our findings provide novel insights into the role of histone modifiers in neural development and suggest that UtxΔ/Uty mice are a potential disease model for Kabuki syndrome."

Microarrays are available for different model organisms, but we use Affymetrix ® HuGene ® ST (Sense Target) arrays, a type of gene array for analysis of human samples. FISH involves fluorescent detection of probe DNA hybridized to an in situ chromosomal target that can be either whole chromosomes or chromosomal segments. The overall hybridization is similar to labeling with radioactive probes but the incorporation of fluorescent detection of the probe sequences allows for high sensitivity in a simple and quick assay.

Recently, a new technique called lectin microarray was developed for rapid profiling of glycosylation in eukaryotic polymers and cell surfaces. Here, we report on the development of a simple and sensitive method based on this technology for direct analysis of intact bacterial cell surface glycomes. The method involves labeling bacterial cells with SYTOX Orange before incubation with the lectin microarray. After washing, bound cells are directly detected using an evanescent-field fluorescence scanner in a liquid phase. Using this method, we compared the cell surface glycomes from 16 different strains of L. casei. The patterns of lectin-binding affinity of most strains were found to be unique. There appears to be two types of lectin-binding profiles: the first is characterized by a few lectins, and the other is characterized by multiple lectins with different specificities. We also showed a dramatic change in the lectin-binding profile of a YIT 9029 derivative with a mutation in the cps1C gene, encoding a putative glycosyltransferase.

Whole-genome sequencing analyzes the entire genome, including noncoding regions (introns) and coding regions (exons).

We were also able to appraise the influence of other biochemical factors and their corresponding inhibiting or enhancing behaviors on thrombin activation.

The diagnosis is easily made by measuring the lateral ventricle width at the level of the atrium, which is normally <10 mm. VM is defined as mild when the atrial width is 10-12 mm, moderate 12-15 mm, severe >15 mm. VM is a non-specific sonographic sign which is common to different pathological entities and genetic conditions. When no associated anomaly can be found VM is defined as isolated. Since the prognosis of fetal VM mainly depends on the presence of associated anomalies, a careful diagnostic approach is necessary to rule out CNS and extra- CNS fetal anomalies. Magnetic Resonance Imaging can be a useful diagnostic tool complementary to ultrasound in order to recognize subtle brain anomalies, particularly cortical disorders. In this review the diagnostic approach to fetal VM will be discussed starting from ultrasound screening, moving to neurosonographic and MRI examination and genetic evaluation, in order to recognize the cause of VM and offer the appropriate counselling to the parents."

This study aimed to understand how the most knowledgeable patients, i.e., pregnant genetic counselors, act in their own pregnancies, thereby gaining insight into the impact of patients' knowledge on the diagnostic process. Seventeen interviews were conducted with Israeli genetic counselors, either pregnant or up to 2 years post-pregnancy. A third of the participants chose not to have CMA while two thirds underwent it despite no detected abnormalities. Although knowledge was the main motivation, counselors varied in the desired degree of information. Two thirds of those opting for CMA wished to have all findings identified whereas roughly one third asked for a targeted platform seeking to avoid uncertain results. Counselors were not quick to adopt new tests such as whole-exome sequencing. Being knowledgeable was described as promoting a sense of control yet also being a source of stress and moral dilemmas. While the basic premise of informed consent is crucial, it does not always make things easier for educated patients. Consequently, raising levels of patient knowledge is only a limited step forward in the search for best practice."

Nucleotide microarrays are well established in plant research, but carbohydrate microarrays are much less established, and one reason for this is a lack of suitable glycans with which to populate arrays. Polysaccharide microarrays are relatively easy to produce because of the ease of immobilizing large polymers noncovalently onto a variety of microarray surfaces, but they lack analytical resolution because polysaccharides often contain multiple distinct carbohydrate substructures. Microarrays of defined oligosaccharides potentially overcome this problem but are harder to produce because oligosaccharides usually require coupling prior to immobilization. We have assembled a library of well characterized plant oligosaccharides produced either by partial hydrolysis from polysaccharides or by de novo chemical synthesis. Once coupled to protein, these neoglycoconjugates are versatile reagents that can be printed as microarrays onto a variety of slide types and membranes. We show that these microarrays are suitable for the high throughput characterization of the recognition capabilities of monoclonal antibodies, carbohydrate-binding modules, and other oligosaccharide-binding proteins of biological significance and also that they have potential for the characterization of carbohydrate-active enzymes."

Trapping surgery was performed, and a spinal drain was inserted from L4/5 for subarachnoid hemorrhage washout. On postoperative day 3, subdural fluid accumulation had increased at the posterior fossa craniotomy site and the cerebellar sulci had narrowed; the ventricles were slightly enlarged. The patient reported headache during head elevation. Low-pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) was suspected. After the spinal drain was removed, headache resolved, and cerebral ventriculomegaly disappeared. The subsequent clinical course was good. The patient was discharged 3 weeks after surgery. LPH is a rare disease caused by various factors and is treated by correcting liquorrhea or overdrainage, when present. Otherwise, drainage at negative CSF pressure is necessary.

Here, we report a meta-analysis of more than 1000 microarrays across twelve independent studies on expression changes in ASD compared to unaffected individuals, in both blood and brain tissues. We identified a number of known and novel genes that are consistently differentially expressed across three studies of the brain (71 samples in total). A subset of the highly ranked genes is suggestive of effects on mitochondrial function. In blood, consistent changes were more difficult to identify, despite individual studies tending to exhibit larger effects than the brain studies.

Next, incubation of the arrays with a fluorescently labeled RNA reveals binding interactions that are detected upon slide imaging. The relative ease with which SMMs are manufactured enables the screening of multiple oligonucleotides in parallel against tens of thousands of small molecules, providing information about both binding and selectivity of identified RNA-small molecule interactions.

To date, only 4 genes are known to cause Mendelian diseases in which congenital hydrocephalus is the main or sole clinical feature, 2 X-linked (L1CAM and AP1S2) and 2 autosomal recessive (CCDC88C and MPDZ). In this study, we aimed to determine the genetic etiology of familial congenital hydrocephalus with the assumption that these cases represent Mendelian forms of the disease.\n## METHODS\nExome sequencing combined, where applicable, with positional mapping.\n## RESULTS\nWe identified a likely causal mutation in the majority of these families (21 of 27, 78%), spanning 16 genes, none of which is X-linked. Ciliopathies and dystroglycanopathies were the most common etiologies of congenital hydrocephalus in our cohort (19% and 26%, respectively). In 1 family with 4 affected members, we identified a homozygous truncating variant in EML1, which we propose as a novel cause of congenital hydrocephalus in addition to its suggested role in cortical malformation. Similarly, we show that recessive mutations in WDR81, previously linked to cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and disequilibrium syndrome 2, cause severe congenital hydrocephalus. Furthermore, we confirm the previously reported candidacy of MPDZ by presenting a phenotypic spectrum of congenital hydrocephalus associated with 5 recessive alleles.\n## INTERPRETATION\nOur study highlights the importance of recessive mutations in familial congenital hydrocephalus and expands the locus heterogeneity of this condition.

There was one paper conforming to the QUADAS standards including 4406 gravidas with adaptability syndromes of prenatal diagnosis including elderly parturient women, abnormal structure by type-B ultrasound, and other abnormalities. Microarray technology yielded successful diagnoses in 4340 cases (98.8%), and there was no need for tissue culture in 87.9% of the samples. All aneuploids and non-parallel translocations in 4282 cases of non-chimera identified by karyotyping could be detected using microarray analysis technology, whereas parallel translocations and fetal triploids could not be detected by microarray analysis technology. In the samples with normal karyotyping results, type-B ultrasound showed that 6% of chromosomal deficiencies or chromosome duplications could be detected by microarray technology, and the same abnormal chromosomes were detected in 1.7% of elderly parturient women and samples with positive serology screening results. In the prenatal diagnosis test, compared with karyotyping, microarray technology could identify the extra cell genetic information with clinical significance, aneuploids, and non-parallel translocations; however, its disadvantage is that it could not identify parallel translocations and triploids."

The availability of the genomic polymorphism data in Arabidopsis thaliana, coupled with the efficient designs of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays removes the requirement for SFP detection and lowers the per array cost, thereby lowering the overall cost per experiment.

Our results show a striking degree of correlation between the genotyping output of both methods, which suggests that the benefit of SFP genotyping in context of BSA can be had with the cheaper, more efficient SNP arrays.

Here, we demonstrate a label-free and high-throughput optical biosensor that can be utilized for calibration of fluorescence microarrays. The sensor employs a commercial flatbed scanner, and we demonstrate transformation of this low cost (∼100 USD) system into an Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensor through hardware and software modifications. Using this sensor, we report detection of DNA hybridization and DNA directed antibody immobilization on label-free microarrays with a noise floor of ∼30 pg/mm2, and a scan speed of 5 s (50 s for 10 frames averaged) for a 2 mm × 2 mm area. This novel system may be used as a standalone label-free sensor especially in low-resource settings, as well as for quality control and calibration of microarrays in existing fluorescence-based DNA and protein detection platforms."

Synthetic plant glycan microarrays equipped with these oligosaccharides enable high-throughput analyses of glycan-binding proteins and carbohydrate-active enzymes.

Synthetic plant glycan microarrays have been used for example to map the epitopes of plant cell wall-directed antibodies, to characterize glycosyl hydrolases and glycosyl transferases, and to analyze lectin binding.

Here, to identify other binding partners of TgRON4 in the host cell, we examined the binding of TgRON4 to components of the host cell surface. TgRON4 binds to various mammalian cells, but this binding disappeared in glycosaminoglycan- and heparan sulfate-deficient CHO cells and after heparitinase treatment of mammalian cells. The C-terminal half of TgRON4 showed relatively strong binding to cells and heparin agarose. A glycoarray assay indicated that TgRON4 binds to heparin and modified heparin derivatives. Immunoprecipitation of T. gondii-infected CHO cell lysates showed that TgRON4 interacts with glypican 1 during Toxoplasma invasion.

Tissue microarray and microfluidics staining methods have emerged as powerful high throughput techniques, but they either only permit the analysis of a single protein per slide or require complex instrumentation and expertise while only staining isolated areas. Here, we introduce IHC microarrays (IHCμA) for multiplexed staining of intact tissues with preserved histological and spatial information. Droplets of a dextran solution containing antibodies were prespotted on a slide and snapped onto a preprocessed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue section soaked in a polyethylene glycol solution. The antibodies are confined within the dextran droplets and locally stain the tissue below with a contrast similar to the one obtained by conventional IHC. The microarray of antibody droplets can be prespotted on a slide and stored, thus neither the preparation of the antibody solutions nor a sophisticated microarray spotter is needed. Sampling considerations with IHCμA were evaluated by taking three tissues with varying levels of cancer cells. A multiplex IHCμA with 180 spots targeting 8 cancer proteins was performed on a breast cancer tissue section to illustrate the potential of this method. This work opens the avenue of applying microarray technologies for conducting IHC on intact tissue slices and has great potential to be used in the discovery and validation of tissue biomarkers in human tumors."

Infants commonly present with progressive macrocephaly whereas children older than 2 years generally present with signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension. The classic understanding of hydrocephalus as the result of obstruction to bulk flow of CSF is evolving to models that incorporate dysfunctional cerebral pulsations, brain compliance, and newly characterised water-transport mechanisms. Hydrocephalus has many causes. Congenital hydrocephalus, most commonly involving aqueduct stenosis, has been linked to genes that regulate brain growth and development. Hydrocephalus can also be acquired, mostly from pathological processes that affect ventricular outflow, subarachnoid space function, or cerebral venous compliance. Treatment options include shunt and endoscopic approaches, which should be individualised to the child. The long-term outcome for children that have received treatment for hydrocephalus varies. Advances in brain imaging, technology, and understanding of the pathophysiology should ultimately lead to improved treatment of the disorder."

Fluorescently tagged glycans with an amino functional group can be prepared from natural glycans released from glycoproteins.

The TGLs, presented in the format of microarrays, provide a convenient platform for identifying the glycan ligands of glycan-binding proteins (GBPs). The chapter provides the background to prepare a defined glycan microarray and uses as an example glycans generated as phosphodiesters and phosphomonoesters of high-mannose type N-glycans. The method describes the preparation of high-mannose type glycan-AEAB conjugates (GAEABs), the purification of their phosphodiesters, and the subsequent mild acid hydrolysis to obtain corresponding phosphomonoesters. These GAEABs are covalently printed as a phosphorylated glycan microarray and used for analysis of the glycan ligand specificities of P-type lectins, such as the mannose-6-phosphate receptors (Man-6-P receptors or MPRs)."

The current study used meta-analytic methods to empirically synthesize studies addressing the association of shunt revisions and IQ in individuals with congenital hydrocephalus. Six studies and three in-house datasets yielded 11 independent samples for meta-analysis. Groups representing lower and higher numbers of shunt revisions were coded to generate effect sizes for differences in IQ scores. Mean effect size across studies was statistically significant, but small (Hedges' g = 0.25, p < 0.001, 95 % CI [0.08, 0.43]) with more shunt revisions associated with lower IQ scores. Results show an association of lower IQ and more shunt revisions of about 3 IQ points, a small effect, but within the error of measurement associated with IQ tests.

In this review, we describe the device physics and operation of the silicon nanowire BioFETs along with recent advances in the field. The silicon nanowire BioFETs are basically the same as the conventional field-effect transistors (FETs) with the exceptions of nanowire channel instead of thin film and a liquid gate instead of the conventional gate. Therefore, the silicon device physics is important to understand the operation of the BioFETs. Herein, physical characteristics of the silicon nanowire FETs are described and the operational principles of the BioFETs are classified according to the number of gates and the analysis domain of the measured signal. Even the bottom-up process has merits on low-cost fabrication; the top-down process technique is highlighted here due to its reliability and reproducibility.

With the development of molecular cytogenetic methods, this situation has dramatically changed. Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), a method of genome-wide detection with high resolution, has been recommended as a first-tier test for prenatal diagnosis, especially for fetuses with structural abnormalities. Methods: Based on the primary literature, this review provides an updated summary of the application of CMA for prenatal diagnosis. In addition, this review addresses the challenges that CMA faces with the emergence of genome sequencing techniques, such as copy number variation sequencing, genome-wide cell-free DNA testing, and whole exome sequencing. Conclusion: The CMA platform is still suggested as priority testing methodology in the prenatal setting currently. However, pregnant women may benefit from genome sequencing, which enables the simultaneous detection of copy number variations, regions of homozygosity and single-nucleotide variations, in near future."

Due to the promising results of the ensemble models in machine learning problems, this paper presents a novel framework, named feature-level aggregation-based ensemble based on overlapped feature subspace partitioning (FLAE-OFSP) for microarray data classification. The proposed ensemble has three main steps: after generating several subsets by the proposed partitioning approach, a feature selection algorithm (i.e., a feature ranker) is applied on each subset, and finally, their results are combined into a single ranked list using six defined aggregation functions. Evaluation of the presented framework based on seven microarray datasets and using four measures, including stability, classification accuracy, runtime, and Modscore shows substantial runtime improvement and also quality results in other evaluated measures compared to individual methods."

The molecular diagnosis of this disorder is established by the identification of a pathogenic variant in either AKT3, CCND2 or PIK3R2. Previously reported AKT3 variants are associated with various brain abnormalities and may lead to megalencephaly. MPPH syndrome is usually due to germline pathogenic AKT3 variants.

            "abstract": "Carbohydrate microarray technologies are new developments at the frontier of glycomics that are showing great promise as tools for high-throughput analysis of carbohydrate-mediated interactions and the elucidation of carbohydrate ligands involved not only in endogenous receptor systems, but also pathogen-host interactions. The main advantage of microarray analysis is that a broad range of glycan sequences can be immobilized on solid matrices as minute spots and simultaneously interrogated. Different methodologies have emerged for constructing carbohydrate microarrays. The NGL (neoglycolipid)-based oligosaccharide microarray platform is among the relatively few systems that are beyond proof-of-concept and have provided new biological information. In the present article, I dwell, in some detail, on the NGL-based microarray. Highlights are the recent applications of NGL-based microarrays that have contributed to knowledge on the molecular basis of pathogen-host interactions, namely the assignments of the carbohydrate-binding specificities of several key surface-adhesive proteins of Toxoplasma gondii and other apicomplexan parasites, and the elucidation of receptor-binding specificities of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1pdm) virus compared with seasonal H1N1 virus."

An analysis of CSF dynamics in this condition has rarely been reported. The aim of this study was to analyze hydrodynamic characteristics of patients with suspected LOVA to discuss its pathophysiological mechanisms and the importance of CSF dynamics analysis for diagnosis and treatment of these patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This retrospective cohort study, conducted between May 2018 and October 2022, included adult patients aged > 18 years investigated in a department of neurosurgery through a lumbar infusion study for suspicion of LOVA (n = 23). These patients were then compared with a control cohort explored for suspicion of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH; n = 30). Clinical symptoms, radiological findings, and hydrodynamic parameters were analyzed. The authors specifically compared two hydrodynamic parameters: resistance to CSF outflow, or Rout, which relies on CSF resorption, and pressure-volume index (PVI), which reflect overall craniospinal compliance. The lumbar infusion study was considered pathological (confirming the diagnosis of chronic hydrocephalus) when at least one of these two parameters was altered.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Rout was significantly less frequently increased (cutoff ≥ 12 mm Hg/ml/min) in patients with LOVA (52%) than in those with iNPH (97%; p < 0.001). In contrast, PVI was impaired (cutoff ≤ 25 ml) in both cohorts, i.e., in 61% of patients with LOVA and in 83% of patients with iNPH. Overall, the rate of pathological lumbar infusion study in LOVA (87%) was not statistically different than in iNPH (100%). However, PVI was the only impaired parameter most frequently found in those with LOVA (35%) compared with those with iNPH (3%; p = 0.002).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study suggests that there is a differential CSF dynamics pattern when comparing patients with LOVA versus those with iNPH. A higher proportion of patients with LOVA showed isolated compliance impairment. These findings highlight the utility of CSF dynamics analysis for the evaluation of patients with suspected chronic obstructive hydrocephalus such as LOVA. Future research with larger case series may help define diagnosis and treatment algorithms of chronic obstructive hydrocephalus based on CSF dynamics analysis, in addition to clinical and radiological criteria."

            "abstract": "An inherited neurologic syndrome in a family of mixed-breed Oriental cats has been characterized as forebrain commissural malformation, concurrent with ventriculomegaly and interhemispheric cysts. However, the genetic basis for this autosomal recessive syndrome in cats is unknown. Forty-three cats were genotyped on the Illumina Infinium Feline 63K iSelect DNA Array and used for analyses. Genome-wide association studies, including a sib-transmission disequilibrium test and a case-control association analysis, and homozygosity mapping, identified a critical region on cat chromosome A3. Short-read whole genome sequencing was completed for a cat trio segregating with the syndrome. A homozygous 7 bp deletion in growth differentiation factor 7 (GDF7) (c.221_227delGCCGCGC [p.Arg74Profs]) was identified in affected cats, by comparison to the 99 Lives Cat variant dataset, validated using Sanger sequencing and genotyped by fragment analyses. This variant was not identified in 192 unaffected cats in the 99 Lives dataset. The variant segregated concordantly in an extended pedigree. In mice, GDF7 mRNA is expressed within the roof plate when commissural axons initiate ventrally-directed growth. This finding emphasized the importance of GDF7 in the neurodevelopmental process in the mammalian brain. A genetic test can be developed for use by cat breeders to eradicate this variant."

This requires heavy-duty computational tools, and novel statistical methods. Microarrays have allowed the interrogation of thousands of common genetic markers in thousands of individuals from the same population (termed genome wide association studies or GWAS) to reveal common variation associated with disease or phenotype. These markers are usually single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are relatively common in the population. In the case of dermatological diseases such as alopecia areata, vitiligo, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, common variants have been identified that are associated with disease, and these provide insights into biological pathways and reveal possible novel drug targets. Other skin phenotypes such as acne, color and skin cancers are also being investigated with GWAS. Analyses of such large GWAS datasets require a consideration of a number of statistical issues including the testing of multiple markers, population substructure, and ultimately a requirement for replication. There are also issues regarding the missing heritability of disease that cannot be entirely explained with current GWAS approaches. Next generation sequencing technologies such as exome and genome sequencing of similar patient cohorts will reveal additional variants contributing to disease susceptibility. However, the data generated with these approaches will be orders of magnitude greater than that those generated with arrays, with concomitant challenges in the identification of disease causing variants."

Briefly, an O-cyanate chain-end functionalized lactose-containing glycopolymer was pre-complexed with polyacrylamide-BA, lysozyme-BA, and bovine serum albumin (BSA)-BA conjugates as macromolecular spacers first and then immobilized onto an amine-functionalized glass slide via isourea bond formation both at pH 10.3, respectively. Subsequently, the macromolecular spacers were detached from the immobilized glycopolymers at pH 7.4 so as to afford the oriented and density controlled glycopolymer microarrays. The spaced glycopolymer microarray showed enhanced lectin (Arachis hypogaea) binding compared to a non-spaced one. Among them, the polyacrylamide-BA spaced glycopolymer showed the highest level of lectin binding compared to lysozyme-BA- and BSA-BA-spaced glycopolymers. Furthermore, SPR results confirmed the same trend of density-dependent lectin binding as the glycoarray. This glyco-macroligand microarray platform permits variations of glycan density in the polymer, glycopolymer density and its orientation on the microarray surface and thus will provide a versatile tool for profiling glycan recognition for both basic biological research and practical applications."

Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) analysis and single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-array) were performed in 1 320 children with DD/ID, ASD, with or without epilepsy and MCA who were admitted to Peking University First Hospital from 2014 to 2019. The results of genetic etiology test of CMA in children with mental retardation or global DD was summarized. Results: Of 1 320 samples, there were 10 cases of aneuploid abnormality, 6 cases of uniparental disomy and one case of mosaicism, respectively. Pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) were found in 320 cases and pathogenic CNVs were detected in 23 cases, with a combined detection rate of 26% (343/1 320). CNVs of uncertain clinical significance occurred in 107 cases, accounting for 8.1% (107/1 320). There were 25 cases of possible benign CNVs, accounting for 2% (25/1 320), while benign CNVs were reported in 20 cases, accounting for 1.5% (20/1 320). The detection rate of MCA with DD/ID was 39.8% (130/327). Conclusions: CMA has the advantages of high resolution and covering the whole genome.

The microbial degradation of algal polysaccharides to their constitutive sugars is a cornerstone in the global carbon cycle in oceans. Marine polysaccharides are highly complex and heterogeneous, and poorly understood. This is also true for marine microbial proteins that specifically degrade these substrates and when characterized, they are frequently ascribed to new protein families. Marine (meta)genomic datasets contain large numbers of genes with functions putatively assigned to carbohydrate processing, but for which empirical biochemical activity is lacking. There is a paucity of knowledge on both sides of this protein/carbohydrate relationship. Addressing this 'double blind' problem requires high throughput strategies that allow large scale screening of protein activities, and polysaccharide occurrence. Glycan microarrays, in particular the Comprehensive Microarray Polymer Profiling (CoMPP) method, are powerful in screening large collections of glycans and we described the integration of this technology to a medium throughput protein expression system focused on marine genes. This methodology (Double Blind CoMPP or DB-CoMPP) enables us to characterize novel polysaccharide-binding proteins and to relate their ligands to algal clades.

This enables decisions regarding the course of pregnancy to be made before viability. Less frequently, amniocentesis is performed in the third trimester. Advanced genomic technologies such as chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) provide more detailed information about the fetus compared with traditional G-banded chromosomal analysis. The aim of this study was to assess the indications for and safety of late amniocentesis, genetic-test results (especially in the context of CMA technology) and outcome of pregnancies that underwent the procedure after 24 weeks.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Medical records were analyzed retrospectively of all women in whom amniocentesis was performed at a gestational age of 24 + 0 to 38 + 6 weeks, at Hadassah Medical Center, between June 2013 and March 2017. Parameters investigated included indications for late amniocentesis, complications, CMA results and pregnancy outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      During the study period, 291 women (303 fetuses, 277 singleton and 14 twin pregnancies; in two twin pairs, one fetus was terminated before amniocentesis) underwent late amniocentesis. CMA was performed in all instances of amniocentesis. The most frequent indication was abnormal sonographic finding(s) (204/303 fetuses, 67%). Preterm delivery occurred in 1.7% and 5.1% of pregnancies within the first week and within 1 month following the procedure, respectively. Aneuploidy was detected in nine (3%) fetuses and nine (3%) others had a pathogenic/likely pathogenic copy number variant, suggesting that CMA doubled the diagnostic yield of traditional karyotyping. Maximal diagnostic yield (17.5%) was achieved for the subgroup of fetuses referred with abnormal sonographic findings in two or more fetal anatomical systems. Variants of uncertain significance or susceptibility loci were found in another nine (3%) fetuses.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In pregnancies undergoing late amniocentesis, CMA increased detection rates of fetal abnormalities and had a shorter turnaround time compared with traditional chromosomal analysis; therefore, late amniocentesis may serve as a helpful tool for detecting fetal abnormalities or reassuring parents following late-appearing abnormal sonographic findings. However, CMA may expose findings of uncertain significance, about which the couple should be precounseled. The procedure appears to be safe. Copyright © 2018 ISUOG.

Lectin microarrays provide a new glycan analysis platform, which enables rapid and sensitive analysis of complex glycans without requiring the release of glycans from the protein. Recent developments in lectin microarray technology enable high-throughput analysis of glycans in complex biological samples. In this review, we will discuss the basic concepts and recent progress in lectin microarray technology, the application of lectin microarrays in biomarker discovery, and the challenges and future development of this technology. Given the tremendous technical advancements that have been made, lectin microarrays will become an indispensable tool for the discovery of glycoprotein biomarkers."

Relative to genomics and proteomics, glycomics is just growing out of infancy with great potential in biomedicine for biomarker discovery, diagnosis, and treatment. However, the immense diversity and complexity of glycan structures and their multiple modes of interactions with proteins pose great challenges for development of analytical tools for delineating structure function relationships and understanding glyco-code. Several tools are being developed for glycan profiling based on chromatography, mass spectrometry, glycan microarrays, and glyco-informatics. Lectins, which have long been used in glyco-immunology, printed on a microarray provide a versatile platform for rapid high throughput analysis of glycoforms of biological samples. Herein, we summarize technological advances in lectin microarrays and critically review their impact on glycomics analysis.

In this study, the lab-on-a-chip system is evaluated; its DNA quantification is estimated by theorems, and the specifications of proposed chip prototypes are compared with the original machines. The analysis results suggest five hypotheses. Using experiments and the data collected from published papers, these hypotheses were either verified or rejected, and the advantages and shortcomings of real-time PCR chips were identified. The proven advantages of the lab-on-a-chip system are its compact size, low sample volume to nano-liter, and short analysis time-less than 10s to complete one PCR cycle and 370 s for completing the whole quantification process. However, the detection limits, quantification uncertainties, and melting analysis ability of the chip prototypes are at best comparable to, and perhaps worse than, those of commercial instruments. Real-time PCR chips are not perfectly accurate diagnostic tools for a laboratory but they have advantages over traditional techniques for point-of-care testing."

Briefly, liposomes carrying anchor lipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE)-PEG(2000)-triphenylphosphine and ganglioside (GM1 or GM3) were prepared first and were then printed onto an azide-modified glass slide so as to afford a liposomal glyco-microarray via Staudinger ligation. Fluorescent dye release kinetics and fluorescence imaging confirmed successful liposome immobilization and specific protein binding to the intact arrayed glycoliposomes. The liposomal glyco-microarray with different gangliosides showed their specific lectin and toxin binding with different binding affinity. The azide-reactive liposome provides a facile strategy for fabrication of either a natural or a synthetic glycolipid-based membrane-mimetic glycoarray. This liposomal glyco-microarray is simple and broadly applicable and thus will find important biomedical applications, such as studying glycolipid-protein interactions and toxin screening applications."

Until the last decade, genome sequencing was very tedious because genome survey sequences (GSS) and/or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) belonging to plasmid, cosmid, and artificial chromosome genome libraries had to be sequenced and assembled in silico. No genome is completely assembled because gaps and unassembled contigs are always remaining. However, most represent an organism's whole genome from a practical point of view. The first genome sequencing projects of trypanosomatid parasites Leishmania major, Trypanosoma cruzi, and T. brucei were completed in 2005 following those strategies. The functional genomics era developed on the basis of microarray technology and has been continuously evolving. In the case of the genus Leishmania, substantial information about differentiation in the digenetic life cycle of the parasite has been obtained. More recently, next generation sequencing has revolutionized genome sequencing and functional genomics, leading to more sensitive and accurate results by using much fewer resources. Though this new technology is more advantageous, it does not invalidate microarray results.

            "abstract": "Mild cerebral ventricular enlargement is associated with schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Fetal ventriculomegaly is the most common central nervous system (CNS) abnormality affecting 1% of fetuses and is associated with cognitive, language, and behavioral impairments in childhood. Neurodevelopmental outcome is partially predictable by the 2-dimensional size of the ventricles in the absence of other abnormalities. We hypothesized that isolated fetal ventriculomegaly is a marker of altered brain development characterized by relative overgrowth and aimed to quantify brain growth using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in fetuses with isolated ventriculomegaly. Fetal brain MRI (1.5 T) was performed in 60 normal fetuses and 65 with isolated ventriculomegaly, across a gestational age range of 22-38 weeks. Volumetric analysis of the ventricles and supratentorial brain structures was performed on 3-dimensional reconstructed datasets. Fetuses with isolated ventriculomegaly had increased brain parenchyma volumes when compared with the control cohort (9.6%, P < 0.0001) with enlargement restricted to the cortical gray matter (17.2%, P = 0.002). The extracerebral cerebrospinal fluid and third and fourth ventricles were also enlarged. White matter, basal ganglia, and thalamic volumes were not significantly different between cohorts. The presence of relative cortical overgrowth in fetuses with ventriculomegaly may represent the neurobiological substrate for cognitive, language, and behavioral deficits in these children."

Methods: Fetuses diagnosed with isolated CCA by ultrasound and MRI and receiving invasive prenatal diagnosis in Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center and Qingyuan People's Hospital from January 2010 to April 2021 were selected. Karyotype analysis and/or CMA [or copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq)] were performed on all fetal samples, and WES was performed on fetal samples and their parents whose karyotype analysis and/or CMA (or CNV-seq) results were not abnormal. Results: Among 65 fetuses with isolated CCA, 38 cases underwent karyotype analysis, and 3 cases were detected with abnormal karyotypes, with a detection rate of 8% (3/38). A total of 49 fetuses with isolated CCA underwent CMA (or CNV-seq) detection, and 6 cases of pathogenic CNV were detected, the detection rate was 12% (6/49). Among them, the karyotype analysis results were abnormal, and the detection rate of further CMA detection was 1/1. The karyotype results were normal, and the detection rate of further CMA (or CNV-seq) detection was 14% (3/21). The detection rate of CMA as the first-line detection technique was 7% (2/27). A total of 25 fetuses with isolated CCA with negative results of karyotyping and/or CMA were tested by WES, and 9 cases (36%, 9/25) were detected with pathogenic genes. The gradient genetic diagnosis of chromosomal karyotyping, CMA and WES resulted in a definite genetic diagnosis of 26% (17/65) of isolated CCA fetuses. Conclusions: Prenatal genetic diagnosis of isolated CCA fetuses is of great clinical significance. The detection rate of CMA is higher than that of traditional karyotyping. CMA detection could be used as a first-line detection technique for fetuses with isolated CCA. WES could increase the pathogenicity detection rate of fetuses with isolated CCA when karyotype analysis and/or CMA test results are negative."

Utilizing a biotin-terminated PAH scaffold prepared via RAFT polymerization, we quickly assembled a panel of glycopolymers that we microarrayed on streptavidin-coated glass. We then demonstrated that in these microarrays, the glycopolymer ligands bind lectins according to the structures of their pendant glycans.

A grid alignment was performed to determine the borderlines between rows and columns of spots. PDEs were applied to detect the inflection points within each column and row; vertical and horizontal luminance profiles were evolved respectively.

The NeuroArray device was based on a stencil design fabricated using a novel sacrificial-layer-protected PDMS molding method that enables production of through-structures in a thin layer of PDMS with feature sizes as small as 3 µm. Using the NeuroArray along with calcium imaging, we have successfully demonstrated large-scale tracking and recording of neuronal activities, and used such data to characterize the spiking dynamics and transmission within a diode-like neural network.

Lack of insurance coverage because of perceived lack of clinical utility was cited among the most frequent reasons why CMA was not ordered when warranted. We compiled a list of genomic regions where haploinsufficiency or triplosensitivity cause genetic conditions with documented management recommendations, estimating that at least 146 conditions potentially diagnosable by CMA testing have published literature supporting specific clinical management implications. Comparison with an existing clinical CMA database to determine the proportion of cases involving these regions showed that CMA diagnoses associated with such recommendations are found in approximately 7% of all cases (n = 28,526). We conclude that CMA impacts clinical management at a rate similar to other genetic tests for which insurance coverage is more readily approved.

Given the limited availability of genomic data for baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-based microarray was used following a feasibility assessment of cross-species hybridization. A heat shock experiment was performed using both BHK and CHO cells and resulting DNA microarray data were analyzed using a filtering criteria of perfect match (PM)/single base mismatch (MM) > 1.5 and PM-MM > 50 to exclude probes with low specificity or sensitivity for cross-species hybridizations. For BHK cells, 8910 probe sets (39 %) passed the cutoff criteria, whereas 12,961 probe sets (56 %) passed the cutoff criteria for CHO cells. Yet, the data from BHK cells allowed distinct clustering of heat shock and control samples as well as identification of biologically relevant genes as being differentially expressed, indicating the utility of cross-species hybridization. Subsequently, DNA microarray analysis was performed on time course samples from laboratory- and manufacturing-scale perfusion bioreactors that were operated under the same conditions. A majority of the variability (37 %) was associated with the first principal component (PC-1). Although PC-1 changed monotonically with culture duration, the trends were very similar in both the laboratory and manufacturing-scale bioreactors. Therefore, despite time-related changes to the cell physiological state, transcriptomic fingerprints were similar across the two bioreactor scales at any given instance in culture. Multiple genes were identified with time-course expression profiles that were very highly correlated (> 0.9) with bioprocess variables of interest. Although the current incomplete annotation limits the biological interpretation of these observations, their full potential may be realized in due course when richer genomic data become available. By taking a pragmatic approach of transcriptome fingerprinting, we have demonstrated the utility of systems biology to support the comparability of laboratory and manufacturing-scale perfusion systems. Scale-down model qualification is the first step in process characterization and hence is an integral component of robust regulatory filings. Augmenting the current paradigm, which relies primarily on cell culture and product quality information, with gene expression data can help make a substantially stronger case for similarity. With continued advances in systems biology approaches, we expect them to be seamlessly integrated into bioprocess development, which can translate into more robust and high yielding processes that can ultimately reduce cost of care for patients."

The state-of-the-art microfluidic technology targets a wider range but smaller volumes of analytes, making the analytical procedure relatively easier and faster. This trend together with faster electronics and modern instrumentation systems will make real-time and in situ analysis a definite possibility. This review focuses on microchip capillary electrophoresis with amperometric detection (MCE-AD) for the detection of DNA and other electroactive analytes. The problems associated with the microchip design, in particular the choice of materials and the configuration of electrodes are discussed thoroughly and solutions are proposed. Significant developments in the related areas are also covered and reviewed critically."

A porous polymeric membrane sealed at the bottom of each well accounts for the sensor support. For each sensing unit, a 6×6 matrix of specific probes is spotted on the external surface of the membrane resulting in 5 mm(2) microarrays. Thanks to the membrane porosity, reagents dispensed into the well can be eliminated through vacuum soaking. This unusual design drastically reduces the assay background signal. The system was first validated on robust models composed of either two complementary oligonucleotide sequences or one allergen/specific rabbit IgG pair. The quality of both oligonucleotide and protein immobilisation on the membrane substrate was then demonstrated together with the capacity to use the arrayed biomolecules as probes for the quantitative detection of specific targets (respectively complementary oligonucleotide and specific antibody). On the basis of these good results, two multiplex assays were developed for crude biological samples testing, focussing on two human in vitro diagnosis applications: a hybridisation assay for multiplex blood group genotyping and a multiparametric immunoassay for allergy diagnosis. In both cases, the transfer to crude biological samples testing was successful i.e. high signal to noise ratio of the stained membranes, reproducibility and good correlation with results obtained using routine testing procedures."

            "abstract": "In the context of environmental health research, biobank blood samples have recently been identified as suitable for high-throughput omics analyses enabling the identification of new biomarkers of exposure and disease. However, blood samples containing the anti-coagulant heparin could complicate transcriptomic analysis because heparin may inhibit RNA polymerase causing inefficient cRNA synthesis and fluorophore labelling. We investigated the inhibitory effect of heparin and the influence of storage conditions (0 or 3 hr bench times, storage at room temperature or -80°C) on fluorophore labelling in heparinized fresh human buffy coat and whole blood biobank samples during the mRNA work-up protocol for microarray analysis. Subsequently, we removed heparin by lithium chloride (LiCl) treatment and performed a quality control analysis of LiCl-treated biobank sample microarrays to prove their suitability for downstream data analysis. Both fresh and biobank samples experienced varying degrees of heparin-induced inhibition of fluorophore labelling, making most samples unusable for microarray analysis. RNA derived from EDTA and citrate blood was not inhibited. No effect of bench time was observed but room temperature storage gave slightly better results. Strong correlations were observed between original blood sample RNA yield and the amount of synthesized cRNA. LiCl treatment restored sample quality to normal standards in both fresh and biobank samples and the previously identified correlations disappeared. Microarrays hybridized with LiCl-treated biobank samples were of excellent quality with no identifiable influence of heparin. We conclude that, to obtain high quality results, in most cases heparin removal is essential in blood-derived RNA samples intended for microarray analysis."

In recent years, digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have been adopted as a platform for sample preparation. However, there remain two major problems associated with sample preparation on a conventional DMFB. First, only a (1:1) mixing/splitting model can be used, leading to an increase in the number of fluidic operations required for sample preparation. Second, only a limited number of sensors can be integrated on a conventional DMFB; as a result, the latency for error detection during sample preparation is significant. To overcome these drawbacks, we adopt a next generation DMFB platform, referred to as micro-electrode-dot-array (MEDA), for sample preparation. We propose the first sample-preparation method that exploits the MEDA-specific advantages of fine-grained control of droplet sizes and real-time droplet sensing. Experimental demonstration using a fabricated MEDA biochip and simulation results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed sample-preparation method."

The large quantity of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) found in tissue samples is thought to be a major factor contributing to the comparatively lower sensitivity of detecting RNA viruses, as a sequence-independent PCR is used to amplify unknown samples for microarray analysis. This study aimed to determine whether depletion or exclusion of rRNA can improve microarray detection and simplify its analysis. Therefore, two different rRNA depletion and exclusion protocols, RiboMinus™ technology and non-rRNA binding hexanucleotides, were applied to the microarray sample processing and the outcome was compared with those of the sequence-independent amplification protocol. This study concludes that the two procedures, described to deplete or exclude rRNA, have negligible effect on the microarrays detection and analysis and might only in combination with further techniques result in a significant enhancement of sensitivity. Currently, existing protocols of random amplification and background adjustment are pertinent for the purpose of sample processing for microarray analysis."

An accurate diagnosis is a key prerequisite in providing a care plan, a prognosis and genetic counselling. The poor specificity of birth defects, the aetiology and course of which can vary despite similar phenotypic patterns, often makes the diagnostic path problematic.

We hypothesized a stepwise order of group performance reflecting the degree of midbrain tectum dysmorphology. Performance on an exogenously cued covert orienting task was compared using repeated measures analysis of covariance, controlling for age. Individuals with SBM and tectal beaking demonstrated the greatest disengagement cost in the vertical plane, whereas individuals with AS performed as well as a typically developing (TD) group. Individuals with SBM but no tectal beaking and individuals with DWM showed greater disengagement costs in the vertical plane relative to the TD group, but better performance relative to the group with SBM and tectal beaking. Individuals with AS, DWM, and SBM and tectal beaking demonstrated poorer inhibition of return than TD individuals. Impairments in attentional disengagement in SBM are not attributable to the general effects of hydrocephalus, but are instead associated with specific midbrain anomalies that are part of the Chiari II malformation."

Methods: Wanfang database, CNKI, CBM, PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were online searched to collect relevant literature published from January 1st, 1980 to November 22th, 2017. Literature were extracted based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) , and analyzed by R software for meta-analysis. The corresponding model was selected according to the results of heterogeneity test to comprehensively analyze the prognosis of the fetus with ventriculomegaly. Results: Five studies were included in the meta analysis, all of them were of high quality (scores>5) . (1) The good prognosis rate of nervous system was 88% (95%CI:0.77-0.95) in fetus with mild ventriculomegaly, was 57% (95%CI:0.18-0.91) in those with moderate ventriculomegaly, and was 36% (95%CI:0.16-0.59) in those with severe ventriculomegaly.

Information on primary congenital hydrocephalus was obtained from the National Patient Discharge Register. Using binomial log-linear regression, we estimated recurrence risk ratios of congenital hydrocephalus. An alternative log-linear regression model was applied to quantify the genetic effect and the maternal effect. Of 1 928 683 live-born children, 2194 had a diagnosis of idiopathic congenital hydrocephalus (1.1/1000). Of those, 75 (3.4%) had at least one other family member with primary congenital hydrocephalus. Significantly increased recurrence risk ratios of primary congenital hydrocephalus were observed for same-sex twins, first- and second-degree relatives as follows: 34.8 (95% confidence interval: 16.4-74.0), 6.2 (95% confidence interval 4.3-8.9) and 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.6-3.1), respectively.

            "abstract": "The rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii is an important model for studying malaria immunity and pathogenesis. One approach for studying malaria disease phenotypes is genetic mapping, which requires typing a large number of genetic markers from multiple parasite strains and/or progeny from genetic crosses. Hundreds of microsatellite (MS) markers have been developed to genotype the P. yoelii genome; however, typing a large number of MS markers can be labor intensive, time consuming, and expensive. Thus, development of high-throughput genotyping tools such as DNA microarrays that enable rapid and accurate large-scale genotyping of the malaria parasite will be highly desirable. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of two P. yoelii strains (33X and N67) and obtained a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Based on the SNPs obtained, we designed sets of oligonucleotide probes to develop a microarray that could interrogate ∼11,000 SNPs across the 14 chromosomes of the parasite in a single hybridization. Results from hybridizations of DNA samples of five P. yoelii strains or cloned lines (17XNL, YM, 33X, N67 and N67C) and two progeny from a genetic cross (N67×17XNL) to the microarray showed that the array had a high call rate (∼97%) and accuracy (99.9%) in calling SNPs, providing a simple and reliable tool for typing the P. yoelii genome. Our data show that the P. yoelii genome is highly polymorphic, although isogenic pairs of parasites were also detected. Additionally, our results indicate that the 33X parasite is a progeny of 17XNL (or YM) and an unknown parasite. The highly accurate and reliable microarray developed in this study will greatly facilitate our ability to study the genetic basis of important traits and the disease it causes."

This protocol outlines the critical steps in flow-patterning DNA, producing and purifying DNA-antibody conjugates, and assessing the quality of the fabricated microarray. The uniformity and sensitivity are comparable with conventional microarrays, while our microarray fabrication does not require the assistance of an array printer and can be performed in most research laboratories. The other major advantage is that the size of our microarray units is 10 times smaller than that of printed arrays, offering the unique capability of analyzing functional proteins from single cells when interfacing with generic microchip designs.

Amongst such ligands, carbohydrate-binding peptides (CBPs) are attractive for use in bioanalytical and biomedical systems due to their biochemical and physicochemical properties; moreover, given the biological significance of lectin-carbohydrate interactions, these ligands offer an opportunity to study peptide sequence and binding characteristics to inform on natural target/ligand interactions. Here, a high-throughput microarray screening technique is described for the identification and study of CBPs, with a focus on polysialic acid (PSA), a polysaccharide found on neural stem cells. The chemical and biological uniqueness of PSA suggests that an ability to exclusively target this glycan may promote a number of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. PSA-binding peptides from phage display screening and from epitope mapping of an scFv for oligosialic acid were screened in an optimized microarray format with three ligand density conditions. Hypothesis-driven mutations were additionally applied to select peptides to modulate peptide affinity and selectivity to PSA. Peptide compositional and positional analyses revealed the significance of various residues for PSA binding and suggested the importance of basic residue positioning for PSA recognition. Furthermore, selectivity studies performed directly on microarrays with chondroitin sulfate A (CS-A) demonstrated the value of screening for both affinity and selectivity in the development of CBPs. Thus, the integrated approach described, with attention to design strategy, screening, and peptide characterization, successfully identified novel PSA-binding ligands and offers a platform for the identification and study of additional polysaccharide-binding peptides."

However, the clinical significance of copy number variants detected by this technology is not always understood, creating uncertainties in interpreting and communicating results.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine parents of eight children who received an uncertain microarray result for their child, either a 16p11.2 microdeletion or 15q13.3 microdeletion. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was used to identify themes within the data. Participants were unprepared for the abnormal test result. They had a complex perception of the extent of their child's condition and a mixed understanding of the clinical relevance of the result, but were accepting of the limitations of medical knowledge, and appeared to have adapted to the result. The test result was empowering for parents in terms of access to medical and educational services; however, they articulated significant unmet support needs. Participants expressed hope for the future, in particular that more information would become available over time. This research has demonstrated that parents of children who have an uncertain microarray result appeared to adapt to uncertainty and limited availability of information and valued honesty and empathic ongoing support from health professionals.

This has identified novel and powerful diagnostic and prognostic and generically applicable markers, promising more specific diagnosis and treatment, together with improved understanding of pathobiology. There is now an urgent need to translate these signatures to clinical use. However, gene microarrays rely on relatively large amounts of fresh starting tissue obviating measurement of Indicator genes in routine practice, and there is a need for development of another, simple, robust, relatively inexpensive and sensitive method for their translation to clinical use. We have piloted the use of real-time PCR measurement of specific prognostic genes, so called \"Indicator\" genes, in globally amplified polyA cDNA for this purpose. Poly(A) PCR coordinately amplifies cDNA copies of all polyadenylated mRNAs, thereby generating a PCR product (polyA cDNA) whose composition reflects the relative abundance of all expressed genes in the starting sample. Poly(A) PCR enables global mRNA amplification from picogram amounts of RNA and has been routinely used to analyse expression in small samples including single cells. The poly(A) cDNA pool generated is also indefinitely renewable and as such represents a \"molecular block\". Real-time PCR measurement, using gene-specific primers and probes, of the expression levels of specific Indicator genes then allows gene signatures to be detected within the poly(A) cDNA, thereby enabling expression profiling of very small amounts of starting material. This chapter details this method as applied to fresh and paraffin embedded tissue and to pancreatic juice. In this chapter, we have concentrated on application of the method to pancreatic cancer, but the generic nature of the method renders it applicable to any cancer type, thereby representing a novel platform for cancer diagnosis across all tumour types."

Here, we propose a novel selective cell retrieval method using microarrays made of a light-responsive gas-generating polymer (LGP microarray). The convex LGP microarray was fabricated by a molding process using polystyrene microarray chips. LGP microarrays generate N2 gas when exposed to a specific light used for fluorescence microscopy. A human cervical cancer cell (HeLa) suspension was spread on the LGP microarray coated by fibronectin. After these HeLa cells were adhered to the surface of the LGP microarray structure, light at a wavelength of 365 nm was used to irradiate the LGP microarray. All the target HeLa cells were selectively released from the light-irradiated surface area of the LGP microarray by the generated N2 gas. The LGP microarray system was also applied to single-cell retrieval, and we easily and rapidly retrieved 100% of the single HeLa cells from the microarrays. In addition, approximately 90% of single HeLa cells retrieved from the LGP microarray proliferated on a chamber of a 96-well plate. Therefore, the LGP microarray system enables easy and selective retrieval of adhered cell groups or single cells with only harmless light irradiation."

To identify such TH-regulated genes and select biomarkers for TH endocrine disruption, global gene expression analyses in tadpoles using microarrays have been done in 21 studies, involving five frog species, seven organs, and four endocrine disrupting chemicals. As expected, each organ has a unique set of genes associated with its tissue-specific metamorphic outcome, and functions ascribed to many of these genes correspond to histological changes induced by TH. Also, the large number of transcription factors identified in microarrays is consistent with the molecular mechanisms of TH action. On the other hand, microarray analysis has also revealed interesting findings not predicted from previous morphological or molecular studies. Furthermore, endocrine disruption studies identified candidate biomarkers for TH disruption, and the mechanisms of action of several endocrine disrupting chemicals have been examined.

Spatial bias varied across models, and the coefficient of variation ranged from 4.6 to 50%, which was unexpectedly large. Next, we evaluated three layouts of spot replicates-local, random, and structured random-for their capacity to predict assay variation. Local replicates are widely used but systematically underestimate the whole-slide variation by up to seven times; structured random replicates gave the most accurate estimation.

Since analysis techniques are under active and ongoing development, storage, transmission and sharing of DNA microarray images need be addressed, with compression playing a significant role. However, existing lossless coding algorithms yield only limited compression performance (compression ratios below 2:1), whereas lossy coding methods may introduce unacceptable distortions in the analysis process. This work introduces a novel Relative Quantizer (RQ), which employs non-uniform quantization intervals designed for improved compression while bounding the impact on the DNA microarray analysis. This quantizer constrains the maximum relative error introduced into quantized imagery, devoting higher precision to pixels critical to the analysis process. For suitable parameter choices, the resulting variations in the DNA microarray analysis are less than half of those inherent to the experimental variability.

            "abstract": "The interaction of carbohydrates with a variety of biological targets, including antibodies, proteins, viruses, and cells are of utmost importance in many aspects of biology. Glycan microarrays are increasingly used to determine the binding specificity of glycan-binding proteins. In this study, a novel microarray support is reported for the fabrication of glycan arrays that combines the higher sensitivity of a layered Si-SiO2 surface with a novel polymeric coating easily modifiable by subsequent click reaction. The alkyne-containing copolymer, adsorbed from an aqueous solution, produces a coating by a single step procedure and serves as a soft, tridimensional support for the oriented immobilization of carbohydrates via azide/alkyne Cu (I) catalyzed \"click\" reaction. The advantages of a functional 3D polymer coating making use of a click chemistry immobilization are combined with the high fluorescence sensitivity and superior signal-to-noise ratio of a Si-SiO2 substrate. The proposed approach enables the attachment of complex sugars on a silicon oxide surface by a method that does not require skilled personnel and chemistry laboratories."

            "abstract": "Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) is a key regulatory factor in gene expression that catalyzes the elongation stage of translation. A functionally impaired eEF2, due to a heterozygous missense variant in the EEF2 gene, was previously reported in one family with spinocerebellar ataxia-26 (SCA26), an autosomal dominant adult-onset pure cerebellar ataxia. Clinical exome sequencing identified de novo EEF2 variants in three unrelated children presenting with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). Individuals shared a mild phenotype comprising motor delay and relative macrocephaly associated with ventriculomegaly. Populational data and bioinformatic analysis underscored the pathogenicity of all de novo missense variants. The eEF2 yeast model strains demonstrated that patient-derived variants affect cellular growth, sensitivity to translation inhibitors and translational fidelity. Consequently, we propose that pathogenic variants in the EEF2 gene, so far exclusively associated with late-onset SCA26, can cause a broader spectrum of neurologic disorders, including childhood-onset NDDs and benign external hydrocephalus."

Chromosomal microarray analysis has been shown to be a valuable clinical diagnostic assay and it should be the first-tier clinical diagnostic test for individuals with these conditions. However and due to several difficulties such as the platform resolution, the cost, and the inexperience with genomic data bases, the implementation of this test in many cytogenetic laboratories has been delayed. In an attempt to provide more insights of the benefits derived by using the chromosomal microarray analysis, this study presents the experience of two clinical centers using three different microarray platforms. The results obtained using a custom microarray (KaryoArray®) and two different commercial medium- and high-resolution whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays have been compared. An overall diagnostic yield of around 15% has been obtained. However, the custom microarray platform has been shown to be more convenient for a clinical setting, since it allows the detection of more pathogenic copy number variants and less common variants."

A deposition of parylene and a coating of Teflon were followed for electrical insulation as well as for enhancement of the hydrophobicity. On the nearly superhydrophobic microlens array surface, the electrowetting of a deionized water droplet was observed over the contact angle range of approximately 140 degrees to approximately 58 degrees by applying 0-200 V, respectively. The electrowetting phenomenon was reversible even in air environment with applied voltages of less than 100 V. The electrowetting on the microlens array surface lost its reversibility after the microlens array surface was completely wetted when the water meniscus touched the bottom of the microlens array. Analysis of meniscus shapes and net force direction follows to elucidate the reversibility. The convex curvature of the microlens caused gradual rather than abrupt impalement of water into the gap among the microlenses."

Significant numbers of pathogenic CNVs contribute toward human genetic disorders. Recent studies suggest a higher diagnostic and clinical significance of low-pass genome sequencing (LP-GS) compared with chromosomal microarrays (CMAs). The performance metrics of the 5X LP-GS was compared with CMA to validate a low-cost and high-throughput method. LP-GS test performed on 409 samples (including 78 validation and 331 clinical) was evaluated using American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. The CNV accuracy, precision, specificity, and sensitivity were calculated to be 100% for all previously characterized CNVs by CMA. Samples (n = 6) run at both approximately 30X GS and approximately 5X GS (LP-GS) average depth detected a concordance of 89.43% to 91.8% and 77.42% to 89.86% for overall single-nucleotide variants and insertions/deletions, respectively. In the 331 clinical samples, 17.2% each were classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic and uncertain clinical significance. In addition, several cases with pathogenic CNVs were detected that were missed by CMA. This study demonstrates that LP-GS (5X GS) was able to reliably detect absence of heterozygosity, microdeletion/microduplication syndromes, and intragenic CNVs with higher coverage and resolution over the genome. Because of lower cost, higher resolution, and greater sensitivity of this test, our study in combination with other reports could be used in an evidence-based review by professional societies to recommend replacing CMAs."

            "abstract": "With the advent of chromosomal microarray testing, microdeletions can be detected in approximately 17% of cases without any abnormality detectable by conventional karyotyping. Structural abnormalities frequently occur at the terminal regions of the chromosomes, called the subtelomeres, because of their structural features. Subtelomere deletions and unbalanced translocations between chromosomes are frequently observed. However, most microdeletions observed by chromosomal microarray testing are microdeletions in intermediate regions. Submicroscopic duplications reciprocal to the deletions seen in the microdeletion syndromes, such as the 16p11.2 region, have been revealed. Discovery of multi-hit chromosomal abnormalities is another achievement by chromosomal microarray testing. Chromosomal microarray testing can determine the ranges of chromosomal structural abnormalities at a DNA level. Thus, the effects of a specific gene deletion on symptoms can be revealed by comparing multiple patients with slightly different chromosomal deletions in the same region (genotype/phenotype correlation). Chromosomal microarray testing comprehensively determines the genomic copy number, but reveals no secondary structure, requiring verification by cytogenetics using FISH. To interpret the results, familial or benign copy number variations (CNV) should be taken into consideration. An appropriate system should be constructed to provide opportunities of chromosomal microarray testing for patients who need this examination and to facilitate the use of results for medical practice."

For the first time we successfully apply PI technique to a wavelength-interrogation SPR imager. This imager is able to offer two-dimensional imaging of the whole array plane. As a result of PI modulation, resolutions of 1.3×10(-6) refractive index unit (RIU) under the normal condition and 3.9×10(-7) RIU under a more time-consuming condition are acquired. The application of this imager was demonstrated by reading microarrays for identification of bacteria, and SPR results were confirmed by means of fluorescence imaging."

The nonuniform electric field for DEP is created by utilizing a nanoelectrode array (NEA) made of vertically aligned carbon nanofibers versus a macroscopic indium tin oxide electrode in a \"points-and-lid\" configuration integrated in a microfluidic channel. The capture of the virus particles has been systematically investigated versus the flow velocity, sinusoidal AC frequency, peak-to-peak voltage, and virus concentration. The DEP capture at all conditions is reversible and the captured virus particles are released immediately when the voltage is turned off. At the low virus concentration (8.9 × 10(4) pfu/mL), the DEP capture efficiency up to 60% can be obtained. The virus particles are individually captured at isolated nanoelectrode tips and accumulate linearly with time. Due to the comparable size, it is more effective to capture virus particles than larger bacterial cells with such NEA-based DEP devices. This technique can be potentially utilized as a fast sample preparation module in a microfluidic chip to capture, separate, and concentrate viruses and other biological particles in small volumes of dilute solutions in a portable detection system for field applications."

The aim of this study was to illustrate the value of a comprehensive genomic evaluation in prenatal diagnosis. We retrospectively reviewed 20 fetuses with clinically significant copy number variants (CNVs) detected by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and no further exome sequencing testing in our tertiary center between 2019 and 2020. The residual DNA from the prenatal cases was used for the parallel implementation of CNV sequencing (CNV-seq) and trio-based clinical exome sequencing (trio-CES). CMA revealed 26 clinically significant CNVs (18 deletions and eight duplications) in 20 fetuses, in which five fetuses had two or more CNVs. There were eight fetuses with pathogenic CNVs (e.g., del 1p36), nine fetuses with likely pathogenic CNVs (e.g., dup 22q11.21), and three fetuses with variants of unknown significance (VOUS, e.g., dup 1q21.1q21.2). Trio-CES identified four fetuses with likely pathogenic mutations (SNV/InDels). Of note, a fetus was detected with a maternally inherited hemizygous variant in the SLX4 gene due to a 16p13.3 deletion on the paternal chromosome. The sizes of CNVs detected by CNV-seq were slightly larger than that of the SNP array, and four cases with mosaic CNVs were all identified by CNV-seq. In conclusion, microdeletion/duplication syndromes and monogenic disorders may co-exist in a subject, and CNV deletion may contribute to uncovering additional recessive disease alleles. The application of a comprehensive genomic evaluation (CNVs and SNV/InDels) has great value in the prenatal diagnosis arena. CNV-seq based on NGS technology is a reliable and a cost-effective technique for identifying CNVs."

Analysis of these comprehensive specificity profiles is facilitated through the use of sequence-specificity landscapes (SSLs). SSLs reveal new modes of sequence cognition and overcome the limitations of current approaches that yield amalgamated \"consensus\" motifs. The landscapes also reveal the impact of nonconserved flanking sequences on binding to cognate sites. SSLs also serve as comprehensive binding energy landscapes that provide insights into the energetic thresholds at which natural and engineered molecules function within cells. Furthermore, applying the CSI binding data to genomic sequence (genomescapes) provides a powerful tool for identification of potential in vivo binding sites of a given DNA ligand, and can provide insight into differential regulation of gene networks.

            "abstract": "This paper describes a method of fabricating rounded bottom microwell arrays (MA) in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) by molding a monolayer of ordered polystyrene (PS) microspheres. PS microspheres were self-assembled on a glass slide and partially melted mainly from the bottom at 240 °C to increase adhesive force with the substrate. The partially melted PS arrays were used as master to generate MA. Microwell sizes are tunable in the 10-20 μm range with rounded bottoms; such a 3D structure is not readily obtainable through conventional soft lithography. Both adherent and nonadherent cell types can be retained in the microwells with high efficiency. As a demonstration of the advantage of real-time cell screening with this MA, single cell enzyme kinetic analysis was also carried out on trapped single cells. The PDMS MA may find applications in high-throughput drug screening, guided formation of cell clusters, and multicellular communication."

The assay is established on the coating conjugate indirect competitive principle and developed under disc-array configuration. The detection is based on the acquisition of attenuated reflective signals that were proportional to optical density of the immunoreaction product. The competitive assay is applied to quantify simultaneously, in a selective manner, non-systemic insecticides in mandarin juices. The detection limits were 0.2 and 0.1 μg L(-1) and the sensitivity 2.1 and 1.5 μg L(-1), for chlorpyrifos and fenthion, respectively. Pollutants were directly quantified after sample dilution in a total time of 40 min. Also, the implementation of positive and negative controls into the array configuration served as an automatic quality control test. The effect of thermal treatment on pesticide dissipation was studied and found that it was insignificant under the studied conditions. Recovery intervals ranged from 96-105% to 94-103%, for chlorpyrifos and fenthion, respectively and were similar to those obtained with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. In the current configuration, 64 samples can be simultaneously analyzed on a disc at a very competitive value, demonstrating its potential for high-throughput multiplexed screening applications for controlled monitoring programs in low-level labs or outside the lab setting."

Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) is the water channel directly implicated in CSF production and a potential therapeutic target in the management of CSF circulation disorders. Pathologies that present ventriculomegaly are associated with defective CSF turnover and AQPs are involved in both the production and reabsorption of CSF. This work examines the levels of AQP1 and its dynamics in ventriculomegaly conditions such as congenital hydrocephalus (communicating and obstructive) or type II lissencephaly versus control. We specifically address the expression of AQP1 in the CSF of 16 term-pregnancy infants where it was found to be significantly increased in obstructive cases when compared with communicating hydrocephalus or control patients. We also defined histologically the expression of AQP1 in the ChP from 6 nonsurvival preterm-pregnancy infants ranging ages between 20 and 25 gestational weeks in which AQP1 was mainly expressed at the apical pole of the ChP epithelium (ChPE) in control and lissencephalic patients. AQP1 expression from the Chiari malformation case showed an inverted polarity being expressed in the basal pole of the ChPE colocalizing with the glucose transporter 1 where this transporter is naturally located."

Methods: A total of 9 cases of microcephaly fetuses diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound or children with microcephaly diagnosed after birth were selected from the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University from January 2014 to August 2022.Karyotype analysis and/or CMA were used to detect. The cases with negative karyotype analysis and CMA results were further sequenced by trio-based WES (Trio-WES). Then the coding genes contained in the pathogenic copy number variation (CNV) fragments were analyzed by gene ontology (GO) enrichment. The genes related to the development of the central nervous system contained in the pathogenic CNV and the pathogenic genes found by Trio-WES were combined for gene interaction network analysis. Results: In this study, 9 cases of microcephaly were recruited, with the time of diagnosis ranged from 23 weeks of gestation to 7 years after birth, and the head circumference of fetus or children ranged from 18.3 to 42.5 cm (-7SD to -2SD). Karyotype analysis was detected in all 9 cases and no abnormality result was found. Eight cases were detected by CMA, and one abnormal was found. Five cases were detected by Trio-WES, and two cases were detected with likely pathogenic genes. The GO enrichment analysis of the coding gene in the 4p16.3 microdeletion (pathogenic CNV) region showed that: in biological process, it was mainly concentrated in phototransduction, visible light; in terms of molecular function, it was mainly concentrated in fibroblast growth factor binding; in terms of cell components, it was mainly concentrated in rough endoplasmic reticulum. Gene interaction network analysis suggested that CDC42 gene could interact with CTBP1, HTT and ASPM gene. Conclusions: CMA could be used as a first-line detection technique for microcephaly. When the results of chromosome karyotype analysis and/or CMA are negative, Trio-WES could improve the detection rate of pathogenicity of microcephaly."

Although CMAs improve diagnostic yields, they increase detection of variants of unknown and uncertain clinical significance (VUS). Understanding parents', paediatricians' and genetic health professionals' (GHPs) views regarding variant disclosure may reduce the potential for communication of unwanted information. A questionnaire was designed to compare disclosure preferences of these three groups in Australia. One hundred and forty-seven parents, 159 paediatricians and 69 GHPs hold similar views with at least 89% of respondents certainly or probably favouring disclosure of all categories of variants. However, some differences were observed between health care providers (HCPs: paediatricians and GHPs) and parents, who were less sure of their disclosure preferences. There was consensus among respondent groups that knowledge of a variant of certain clinical significance would provide more practical and emotional utility compared to VUS. Compared to HCPs, parents placed more emphasis on using knowledge of a VUS when considering future pregnancies (p < 0.001). This study may help HCPs anticipate parents' preferences for genomic testing. As whole exome/genome sequencing is integrated into clinical practice, the potential for differing views of parents and HCPs should be considered when developing guidelines for result disclosure."

We further refined the analysis by using a technique derived from statistical mechanics, capable of distinguishing the two main phases of NBs, i.e. (i) a propagating and (ii) a reverberating phase, and by classifying the trajectory patterns. Finally, this methodology was applied to signal representations based on spike detection, i.e. the instantaneous firing rate, and directly based on voltage-coded raw data, i.e. activity movies.

Prenatal samples were retrieved by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling and sent to our prenatal genetic diagnosis laboratory for chromosomal microarray analysis. The risk of carrying a fetus with pathogenic copy number variants is stratified by the patients' primary indication for invasive testing. We searched the literature for published prenatal chromosomal microarray data to generate a large cohort of 23,865 fetuses. The characteristics and spectrum of pathogenic copy number variants including the type of aberrations (gains or losses), genomic loci, sizes, and the mode of inheritance were studied.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall, 375 of 23,865 fetuses (1.6%) carried pathogenic copy number variants for any indication for invasive testing, and 44 of them (11.7%) involve 2 or more pathogenic copy number variants. A total of 428 pathogenic copy number variants were detected in these fetuses, of which 280 were deletions and 148 were duplications. Three hundred sixty (84.1%) were less than 5 Mb in size and 68 (15.9%) were between 5 and 10 Mb. The incidence of carrying a pathogenic copy number variant in the high-risk group is 1 in 36 and the low-risk group is 1 in 125. Parental inheritance study results were available for 311 pathogenic copy number variants, 71 (22.8%) were maternally inherited, 36 (11.6%) were paternally inherited, and 204 (65.6%) occurred de novo.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Collectively, pathogenic copy number variants are common in pregnancies. High-risk pregnancies should be offered invasive testing with chromosomal microarray analysis for the most comprehensive investigation. Detection limits on size, parental inheritance, and genomic distribution should be carefully considered before implementing copy number variant screening in expanded noninvasive prenatal screening."

            "abstract": "In recent studies involving NAPPA microarrays, extra-well fluorescence is used as a key measure for identifying disease biomarkers because there is evidence to support that it is better correlated with strong antibody responses than statistical analysis involving intraspot intensity. Because this feature is not well quantified by traditional image analysis software, identification and quantification of extra-well fluorescence is performed manually, which is both time-consuming and highly susceptible to variation between raters. A system that could automate this task efficiently and effectively would greatly improve the process of data acquisition in microarray studies, thereby accelerating the discovery of disease biomarkers. In this study, we experimented with different machine learning methods, as well as novel heuristics, for identifying spots exhibiting extra-well fluorescence (rings) in microarray images and assigning each ring a grade of 1-5 based on its intensity and morphology. The sensitivity of our final system for identifying rings was found to be 72% at 99% specificity and 98% at 92% specificity. Our system performs this task significantly faster than a human, while maintaining high performance, and therefore represents a valuable tool for microarray image analysis."

            "abstract": "High throughput methods deliver large amount of data serving to describe the physiological treatment that is being studied. In the case of microarrays, there would be a clear benefit to integrate the published data sets. However, the numerous methodological discrepancies between microarray platforms make this comparison impossible. This incompatibility is magnified when considering the peculiar context of transcript management in early embryogenesis. The total RNA content is known to profoundly fluctuate during development. In addition, the mRNA population is subjected to poly(A) tail shortening and elongating events, a characteristic of stored and recruited messengers. These intrinsic factors need to be considered when interpreting any transcript abundance profiles during early development. As a consequence, many methodological details affect microarray platform performances and prevent compatibility. In an effort to maximize our microarray platform performance, we determined the various sources of variation for every one of the main steps leading to the production of microarray data. The five main steps involved in sample preparation were evaluated, as well as conditions for post-hybridization validation by qRT-PCR. These determinations were essential for the implementation of standardized procedures for our Research Network but they can also provide insight into the compatibility issues that the microarray community is now facing."

This microarray was used to mimic highly diluted gel and to maintain electrolyte within the pillar zone by capillary effect. The electrolyte composition (glycerol and agarose content) was investigated in order to improve protein separation by isoelectric focusing (IEF). The influence of glycerol on focusing time and on the different evaporative contributions was further evaluated. In order to perform an immunodiagnostic of milk allergy, different surface treatments were optimized to prevent milk allergen adsorption on PDMS surface. Poly(dimethylacrylamide)-co-allyl glycidyl ether (PDMA-AGE) as well as gelatin led to a satisfactory signal to noise ratio. Finally the possibility to perform protein mixture separation using this micropillar array chip followed by immunoblotting was demonstrated by using the serum from an allergic individual, confirming the great potential of this analytical platform in the field of immunodiagnosis."

Ten-fold variation is common, yet the specific causes and consequences of this variation are largely unknown. By combining classic gene mapping methods-family linkage studies and genomewide association-with high-throughput genomics, it is now possible to define quantitative trait loci (QTLs), single-gene variants, and even single SNPs and indels that control gene expression in different brain regions and cells. This review considers some of the major technical and conceptual challenges in analyzing variation in expression in the CNS with a focus on mRNAs, rather than noncoding RNAs or proteins. At one level of analysis, this work has been highly successful, and we finally have techniques that can be used to track down small numbers of loci that control expression in the CNS. But at a higher level of analysis, we still do not understand the genetic architecture of gene expression in brain, the consequences of expression QTLs on protein levels or on cell function, or the combined impact of expression differences on behavior and disease risk. These important gaps are likely to be bridged over the next several decades using (1) much larger sample sizes, (2) more powerful RNA sequencing and proteomic methods, and (3) novel statistical and computational models to predict genome-to-phenome relations."

We propose Batch effect Reduction of mIcroarray data with Dependent samples usinGEmpirical Bayes (BRIDGE), a three-step parametric empirical Bayes approach that leverages technical replicate samples profiled at multiple timepoints/batches, so-called \"bridge samples\", to inform batch-effect reduction/attenuation in longitudinal microarray studies. Extensive simulation studies and an analysis of a real biological data set were conducted to benchmark the performance of BRIDGE against both ComBat and longitudinalComBat. Our results demonstrate that while all methods perform well in facilitating accurate estimates of time effects, BRIDGE outperforms both ComBat and longitudinal ComBat in the removal of batch-effects in data sets with bridging samples, and perhaps as a result, was observed to have improved statistical power for detecting genes with a time effect. BRIDGE demonstrated competitive performance in batch effect reduction of confounded longitudinal microarray studies, both in simulated and a real data sets, and may serve as a useful preprocessing method for researchers conducting longitudinal microarray studies that include bridging samples."

We demonstrate that the specificity of MACRO is ~100%, with a limit of detection (LOD) that is suitable for real-world applications. Moreover, the results obtained of simulated complex samples and blind samples with MACRO were 100% consistent with expectations and the results of independently performed real-time PCRs, respectively.

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method to construct three-dimensional curved microstructures with easy control of the size, position and shape, by exploiting the elasticity of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) membranes and basic physics. For this end, we developed the method to handle thin PDMS membrane safely, and to replicate PDMS microstructure from the PDMS mold. Using this method, we demonstrated two potential applications: (1) the use of concave well for the formation of embryoid body (EB) to differentiate into neuronal cells, and (2) the fabrication of SU-8 and hydrogel microparticles having diverse curved shapes. The curved structures were successfully fabricated with simple process, and EBs were formed in the concave well and differentiated into the neuronal cells. Microparticles with diverse shapes were fabricated from a range of materials for potential use as drug carrier and pH responsive micro-actuator elements."

            "abstract": "We report acute encephalopathy in two cases with severe congenital hydrocephalus. Case 1 was a 23-month-old girl, born at of 36weeks gestation and delivered by cesarean section due to congenital hydrocephalus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed prominent ventricular dilation associated with hydrocephalus, Dandy-Walker variant and cortical malformation. The blood test for toxoplasmosis, syphilis, varicella-zoster, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus (TORCH) complex and various metabolic tests of blood and urine specimens yielded unremarkable results. She was admitted to our hospital for respiratory failure with fever and her clinical course deteriorated, progressing to hemiconvulsion hemiplegia epilepsy syndrome. Case 2 was a 17-month-old boy, born by spontaneous vertex delivery at 39weeks. Severe, asymmetrical ventricular dilation associated with hydrocephalus, cerebellar and brainstem hypoplasia, and punctuate calcifications of the thalamus, third and fourth ventricles, around the aqueduct, were observed on computed tomography (CT). The blood test for TORCH complex and various metabolic tests of blood and urine specimens yielded unremarkable results. He was admitted to our hospital for status epilepticus with fever and his clinical course progressed to hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome. In patients with brain disorders, diagnosis and treatment are likely to be delayed and prognosis may thereby be worsened. When status epileptics or prolonged coma manifests even in patients with severe brain disorders, we must consider encephalopathy in the differential diagnosis."

            "abstract": "We report the design and fabrication of a novel single cell electroporation biochip featuring high aspect ratio nickel micro-electrodes with smooth side walls between which individual cells are attached. The biochip is fabricated using Proton Beam Writing (PBW), a new direct write lithographic technique capable of fabricating high quality high-aspect-ratio nano and microstructures. By applying electrical impulses across the biochip electrodes, SYTOX® Green nucleic acid stain is incorporated into mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells and observed via green fluorescence when the stain binds with DNA inside the cell nucleus. Three parameters; electric field strength, pulse duration, and numbers of pulses have been investigated for the single cell electroporation process. The results indicate high transfection rates as well as cell viability of 82.1 and 86.7% respectively. This single cell electroporation system may represent a promising method for the introduction of a wide variety of fluorophores, nanoparticles, quantum dots, DNAs and proteins into cells."

            "title": "Bacterial Surface Glycans: Microarray and QCM Strategies for Glycophenotyping and Exploration of Recognition by Host Receptors.",
            "abstract": "Bacterial surfaces are decorated with a diversity of carbohydrate structures that play important roles in the bacteria-host relationships. They may offer protection against host defense mechanisms, elicit strong antigenic responses, or serve as ligands for host receptors, including lectins of the innate immune system. Binding by these lectins may trigger defense responses or, alternatively, promote attachment, thereby enhancing infection. The outcome will depend on the particular bacterial surface landscape, which may substantially differ among species and strains. In this chapter, we describe two novel methods for exploring interactions directly on the bacterial surface, based on the generation of bacterial microarrays and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor chips. Bacterial microarrays enable profiling of accessible carbohydrate structures and screening of their recognition by host receptors, also providing information on binding avidity, while the QCM approach allows determination of binding affinity and kinetics. In both cases, the chief element is the use of entire bacterial cells, so that recognition of the bacterial glycan epitopes is explored in their natural environment."

            "abstract": "Major challenges of glycomics are to characterize a glycome and identify functional glycans as ligands for glycan-binding proteins (GBPs). To address these issues we developed a general strategy termed shotgun glycomics. We focus on glycosphingolipids (GSLs), a class of glycoconjugates that is challenging to study, recognized by toxins, antibodies and GBPs. We derivatized GSLs extracted from cells with a heterobifunctional fluorescent tag suitable for covalent immobilization. We separated fluorescent GSLs by multidimensional chromatography, quantified them and coupled them to glass slides to create GSL shotgun microarrays. Then we interrogated the microarrays with cholera toxin, antibodies and sera from individuals with Lyme disease to identify biologically relevant GSLs that we subsequently characterized by mass spectrometry. Shotgun glycomics incorporating GSLs and potentially glycoprotein-derived glycans is an approach for accessing the complex glycomes of animal cells and is a strategy for focusing structural analyses on functionally important glycans."

There is scarcity of literature on the guidelines for prognostication based on outcomes as per the ventricle size.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this work was to study outcome of antenatally detected isolated ventriculomegaly in terms of medical termination, postnatal neuro-developmental milestones, and mortality; and also to propose a new prognostication classification.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Prospective and retrospective observational study on antenatal mothers with isolated ventriculomegaly diagnosed in fetus. Outcomes in terms of termination of pregnancy, postnatal mortality, need of surgery, and morbidity were recorded. Patients were categorized into four groups: Group 1--ventricle size <10 mm, II--11-15 mm, III--16-20 mm, and IV > 20 mm and neuro-developmental milestones were co-related.

Group 3 patients had normal neurodevelopmental milestones in 60% only while shunt surgery was required in 40% of patients. All patients of group 4 had poor outcome with only 50% survival. No association with chromosomal anomalies and heart disease was found.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Prognosis of isolated ventriculomegaly depends upon size of ventricles and its progressive increase on serial ultrasounds.

The flexibility of the architecture is demonstrated with a commercial molecular biology protocol for mRNA amplification, implemented without significant modification. The performance of the microchip system is compared to conventional bench processing at each stage of the multistep protocol, and DNA microarrays are used to assess the quality and performance of bench- and microchip-amplified RNA. The results show that the microchip system reactions are similar to bench control reactions at each step, and that the microchip- and bench-derived amplified RNAs are virtually indistinguishable in differential microarray analyses."

Here, we illustrate using some case studies that show the design and the use of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol oligosaccharide library. We discuss the importance of parasite glycosylphosphatidylinositol-protein interactions including receptors, enzymes, and antibodies. Furthermore, glycosylphosphatidylinositol epitope mapping studies are of interest in the field of parasitic diseases, and provide a promising platform to understand structure-function relationships of glycosylphosphatidylinositols."

However, as with most scientific methods, WES also has its limitations. The aim of the study was to report a fetal case of RNU4ATAC-opathy which was missed by prenatal WES.\n    \n\n\n          Case presentation:\n        \n      \n      A 28-year-old healthy primigravida was revealed by ultrasound at 20 + 3 weeks of gestation to have a fetus with ventriculomegaly (left 15.1 mm/right 11.9 mm), hypoplastic vermis, and mild growth retardation. Chromosomal microarray analysis and trio WES failed to detect a pathogenic copy number variation and sequence variant. A repeat ultrasound at 23 + 3 weeks showed worsened growth delay and hydrocephalus (left 20.3 mm/right 11.0 mm) with vermis hypoplasia and agenesis of corpus callosum. Further study with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) detected 2 missense mutations of the noncoding RNU4ATAC (NR_023343.1) gene, n.51G>A (rs188343279) and n.16G>A (rs750325275), in the fetus, which were inherited from the father and mother, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Our study highlights the limitation of WES.
