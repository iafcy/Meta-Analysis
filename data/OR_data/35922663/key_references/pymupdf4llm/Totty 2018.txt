## Use of photograph-based telemedicine
 in postoperative wound assessment to diagnose or exclude surgical site infection


Objective: This study aims to assess whether a clinician reviewing
photographs of a wound was an acceptable substitute for clinical
review in order to identify or exclude surgical site infection (SSI).
Method: We undertook a mixed methods study consisting of a
qualitative public involvement exercise and a prospective, nonrandomised, single-centre study of patients undergoing clean or cleancontaminated vascular surgery. For the qualitative study, two
semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted. For the
prospective study, patients were invited to attend a wound review at
5–7 days and 30 days postoperatively. At review, wounds were scored
by a study nurse or doctor, according to the ASEPSIS scale.
Anonymised wound photographs were taken and independently
reviewed, and ASEPSIS scored by two independent investigators
blinded to the original ‘clinical review’ ASEPSIS score.
Results: In the qualitative study, three female patients were
interviewed across two dates. Emerging themes included the burden of
SSI, hospital follow-up and telemedical follow-up. A total of 37 patients


with a mean age of 61.14 years were included in the quantitative
analysis. There was a total of 53 wound reviews. There was >85%
agreement between photograph and clinical reviewers in all categories
except erythema. The specificity of photograph review for diagnosis of
SSI was 90%. The intraclass correlation coefficient for total ASEPSIS
score was R=0.806 (95% CI 0.694, 0.881), indicating strong reliability
between reviewers.
Conclusion: Our data shows that, in the assessment of SSI, there is
good correlation between face-to-face clinical and remote
photographic review. Incorporating this method of wound assessment
into a postoperative follow-up care pathway may save patients and
clinicians from unnecessary hospital visits, particularly when
conducting health research.
Declaration of interest: There are no conflicts of interest. The public
involvement exercise part of this study was funded through an award
from the National Institute for Health Research Research Design
Service for Yorkshire and the Humber.

urgical site infection (SSI) has a reported
incidence of between 1% and 9.2% in
England, rising to 25% in some studies,[1,2]
and is a significant cause of morbidity and
mortality. Consequences of SSI may

# Sinclude prolongation of hospital admission or

readmission to hospital, sepsis, a return to the
operating theatre, amputation, and even death.[3,4] The
early identification of SSI is important as early
infections can often be managed on an outpatient
basis with oral antibiotics rather than requiring
readmission to hospital for intravenous treatment,
more complex dressing management or
surgical debridement.

Typically, following discharge from hospital,
identification of infection requires clinical review,
either by the patient’s primary physician, practice or
community nurse, or as a hospital outpatient. This
could be burdensome to the patient, who may require

additional mobility aids, hospital transport, and friends
or family support to attend appointments. There is an
associated cost to both the patient, in the form of
opportunity and financial costs, and to the health-care
provider, in terms of the financial burden of clinician
time and further treatment. Although some health
professionals now employ telephone consultations as
routine practice, these lack the ability to make an
objective assessment, and clinicians must rely upon the
information provided by the patient.

In the digital age, clinicians are increasingly turning
towards technology to aid patient assessment in a timely
and safe manner.[5] Telemedicine has been proposed as a
potential solution,[6 ]and in a 2010 systematic review the
technology was rated as ‘good’ by 20 studies, and
‘promising’ by a further 19 studies.[7] As 81% of UK adults
own a smartphone,[8] clinicians could use this technology
in both routine practice and clinical trials to improve
diagnosis and study retention rates and reduce the cost
of follow-up.

pilot study into SSI undertaken in the same centre.[10]
Wound assessment was undertaken by a research nurse
or doctor, and wounds scored on a modified ASEPSIS
scale,[11] aimed at objectively scoring wounds for SSI.
Wounds were scored for:

- Erythema (defined as any redness around the wound

area)—3 points



- To investigate the acceptability to patients of

telemedicine-based clinical follow-up.


###### Methods
Study design
The study was a mixed methods study consisting of a
prospective, non-randomised, single-centre study, taking
place between January and May 2017. The study was
carried out within a tertiary vascular surgery service at a
university teaching hospital, and a public involvement
(PI) consultation exercise took place in April 2017 in the
same centre. The study was approved by a research ethics
committee (16/LO/2135) and all patients provided
written and informed consent before inclusion in line
with the Declaration of Helskini (1974).

Inclusion criteria for the prospective study were
patients over the age of 18 years and undergoing clean
or clean-contaminated vascular surgery. Inclusion
criteria for the PI exercise were patients who had been
diagnosed with SSI in a three-month period leading up
to invitation to take part in the study. No specific
exclusion criteria was set for the public involvement
excercise. For the prospective part of the study, patients
undergoing carotid endarterectomy, and patients who
were unable to give consent due to incapacity (as
defined by the Mental Capacity Act 2005)[9] were
excluded from the study.

Public involvement exercise
The PI exercise consisted of two semi-structured focus
group interviews, each lasting approximately
90 minutes. Interviews were conducted using a topic
guide, however, a flexible format was used to allow
patients to express thoughts and opinions freely. Topics
included SSI, wound dressings and research procedures.
Eligible patients were identified through the vascular
ward discharge register and through the vascular
surgery consultants. They were invited to participate by
letter, and sent an information sheet to read, followed
by a telephone call to discuss the study further and
confirm participation. The exercise took place in a
hospital setting that was comfortable and accessible. All
interviews were audio recorded, with the consent of
participants, and transcribed verbatim.



- Serous exudate—3 points

- Purulent exudate—6 points



- Wound edge separation—6 points.
When the ASEPSIS scale was used to diagnose infection
in clinical practice, further marks were given for:

- Antibiotic prescription—10 points



- Abscess drainage 5 points

- Wound debridement—10 points

- Isolation of bacteria —10 points



- Prolonged stay or readmission to hospital—5 points.

A score of ≥21 was diagnostic of SSI.


Public involvement exercise: statistical analysis
Data was managed using a qualitative computer
software package (NVIVO, QSR International). Analysis
involved a process of transcription, organisation into
categories (dressings, follow-up, infection,
photographs, travel distance and trial procedures),
writing and theorising.

Prospective study: postoperative follow-up
On postoperative day 5–7, and postoperative day
30(±3 days), patients were invited for clinical review.
These intervals were chosen as a result of a previous


Prospective study: photograph
procedures and assessment
After clinical review, anonymous digital photographs
were taken of the patients’ wounds by a different
researcher using the same 16.1 megapixel compact
digital camera (Nikon Coolpix L31). There was no
standardisation of flash, focus or distance from wound.
Single or multiple frontal photographs were taken of
each wound, at the discretion of the photographer, to
allow close-up viewing of the wound. Photographers
ensured that the whole wound was seen in either a
single photograph, or between the photographs taken,
and used the camera viewing screen to identify whether
the sharpness of the image was sufficient to be used. No
lateral views were taken. The digital photograph images
were uploaded to a secure hospital server and reviewed
separately by two independent doctors (Reviewers PR1
and PR2). Reviews were completed using standard
definition LCD computer display screens. Review
doctors were not involved in routine clinical follow-up
of participants in the study, and had not seen any of
the wounds before reviewing the photographs.
Reviewers scored the wounds according to the modified
ASEPSIS scale, set out above.

In addition to scoring the wounds, the two clinicians
assessing photographs were asked to state whether they
would like to review the patient in person to fully assess
their clinical condition, if they suspected superficial SSI.

Prospective study: statistical analysis
Data was collected using a purpose-designed Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond,
Washington). Statistical analysis was performed using
IBM SPSS 23 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York).


Inter-observer agreement
Percentage agreement values and Cohen’s Kappa[12]
values were calculated to assess for inter-rater reliability
between the in-room reviewer and each photograph
reviewer, and between the two photograph reviewers


-----

(PR1 and PR2). As the photograph reviewers in this
study were blinded to patient outcome, correlation
values were calculated by using only the subjective
wound appearance scores from the ASEPSIS tool.

Sensitivity and specificity
To calculate sensitivity and specificity values, it was
assumed that when reviewing photographs, asking for
a further review of the patient constituted diagnosis of
an infection. The ‘gold standard’ of diagnosis at clinical
review was either total ASEPSIS score ≥21 (as outlined
above), or prior diagnosis of infection by the attending
physician, taken from the patient’s clinical notes, as
defined by the Centres for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC).[13,14]

Contact with health professionals and hospital stay
Multiple contacts with health professionals was a
recurring theme during the course of a SSI. In general,
patients were attended to by a GP, a practice nurse,
district nurses and their hospital consultant before
readmission to hospital. A patient also attended their
local accident and emergency department. The average
length of readmission was 13 days (range: 9–17 days),
which had a significant impact on the patient:


_‘[I was] devastated. Absolutely devastated.’ (patient 2)_

Even after discharge, patients continued to be
dependent on healthcare services, requiring daily or
alternate daily dressings from community care teams.


###### Results
Public involvement exercise
A total of nine patients were invited to take part in the
exercise. From this group, three female participants
were recruited and attended both sessions (the other six
patients either declined to take part or were unable to
attend both sessions). The mean age of participants was
70 years (range: 61–79 years). Several themes emerged
during analysis of the data, including SSI, hospital
follow-up and the use of telemedicine.

Surgical site infection: pre-procedure awareness
All three patients acknowledged that infection had
been mentioned to them as a consequence of
undergoing an operative procedure. When asked, one
patient explicitly stated that she did not consider it
important before the operation:


Hospital follow-up shortly after an operation
Patients felt that follow-up shortly (seven days) after an
operation would be problematic, particularly in the
context of a clinical research trial:

_‘I don’t think I’d have managed it’ (patient 2)_

_‘I don’t think you’re feeling well enough to do that.’_
_(patient 2)_


Antibiotic therapy
Patients described antibiotic therapy as ‘horrendous,’
‘really, really bad’ and ‘awful’. Common concerns
included intravenous (IV) access for antibiotic therapy
with one patient stating in reference to IV cannulation:

_‘I could cry even thinking about it.’ (patient 2)_


Reviewer: ‘Did you feel that it was important before
_your operation, or did you consider it as important_
_before your operation?’_
Patient: ‘No, I didn’t.’ (patient 3)


Physical and non-physical consequences of infection
All three patients spoke at length about the
consequences of infection, both physical:

_‘I don’t walk far.’ (patient 3)_


Attending hospital
Patients found that attending hospital was a particular
problem at any time—one patient lived 34 miles away
from hospital—citing an inability to drive after
an operation:

_‘I’d have to get somebody to bring me.’ (patient 3)_


Issues around ‘no parking’, and problems with traffic:

_‘To get here for two today, I left at one. If I do it at_
_midnight it’s 15 minutes.’ (patient 1)_


_‘Getting in and out of the car still is a problem’_
_(patient 3)_

As well as non-physical:


_‘Emotionally it’s been a nightmare, and if go out and_
_about with anyone they have to realise that I do have_
_to stop every so often.’ (Patient 2)_


Telemedicine follow-up: home visits and
follow-up conducted by postal questionnaire only
Patients had mixed feelings about home visits, with
one patient stating it:

_‘Wouldn’t bother me and I live on my own.’ (patient 1)_


Most patients described an impact on daily activities such
as being unable to shop, walk or, at times, dress themselves:

_‘I struggle to get dressed, trousers and underwear_
_especially.’ (patient 2)_


But others expressed that patients may find
it ‘intrusive’:

_‘I do think a lot of people, these days especially, don’t_
_like people coming in in their homes.’ (patient 2)_

Telemedicine using a photograph and a phonecall
Patients in general felt that enough information could be
gathered over the telephone to assess their current health:

_‘if you asked the right questions’ (Patient 3)._


All patients felt they were either technically ‘savvy’
enough to photograph their own wound and send it
to doctors:

_‘Oh yes I could do that, I send photographs of my_
_garden.’ (patient 1)_


Or could find assistance in doing so:

_‘I’d get my son to take them.’ (patient 3)_


No patients expressed concerns over the anonymity
of photographs:

_‘Take a photograph of my leg it could be anyone’s leg.’_
_(patient 3)_


Or the sharing of photographs between patients and
doctors or between health professionals using
secure servers:

_‘If your name isn’t on it, it doesn’t matter, they’ve got_
_far more interesting photographs on the internet.’_
_(patient 1)_


_‘Feel like you were just drawing a line under me.’_
_(patient 2)_


Photographing wounds
In general, patients found the idea of photographing
their wounds acceptable:

_‘It wouldn’t bother me having photographs taken.’_
_(patient 2)_


Patients did express that they felt reassured by seeing a
doctor or a nurse in person for follow-up:

_‘I think you need the reassurance as well and you just_
_need to know its doing okay,’ (patient 1)_

But when asked about using a photograph to show
their wound to a doctor on the other end of a telephone,
all patients were in agreement that this offered them
the same reassurance:

_‘Yeah, plus the photograph as well, helps if you thought_
_there was something suspicious then you could pick up_
_on that.’ (patient 2)_

ASEPSIS Score


Prospective Study
For the prospective study, 37 patients, 23 male and
14 female, with a mean age of 61.14 years (range:
38–83 years) had a total of 53 photographs taken of
their surgical wound sites, and compared with the
assessment made at the prior formal clinical review. Of
the 53 photographs, 30 were taken at the 5–7 day
follow-up appointment. Table 1 illustrates demographic
data for the patient cohort.

The total available ASEPSIS Score to be compared
using correlation statistics was 18. The overall spread of
this score for conventional clinical review is shown
in Fig 1.


-----

Inter-observer agreement
For the presence or absence of erythema, serous
exudate, purulent exudate or wound edge separation,
percentage agreement values are shown in Table 2.

The two photograph reviewers had >85% agreement
with each other in all four categories, and >85%
agreement independently with the clinical reviewer in
all categories except erythema. For Kappa values, a
value of 0.21–0.40 was taken to indicate a fair
agreement, 0.41–0.60 a moderate agreement, 0.61–0.80
a substantial agreement and 0.80–1.00 an almost
perfect agreement.[15] Agreement between the
photograph reviewers was statistically significant for all
four ASEPSIS categories, reaching substantial or almost
perfect agreement for erythema and purulent exudate
(Table 3). Agreement between the clinical and
photograph reviewers was more variable. Agreement
between the clinical reviewer and first photograph
reviewer reached statistical significance in two of the
four ASEPSIS categories (purulent exudate and
separation of wound edges). Agreement between the
clinical reviewer and second photograph reviewer
reached statistical significance in three of the four
ASEPSIS categories (erythema, serous exudate and
purulent exudate).

From the ASEPSIS tool used in this study, only
erythema showed a weak correlation between assessors,
with Cohen’s Kappa value of 0.308 and
0.053 respectively. Of the wounds, 18 were identified as
erythematous in person, with 13 and 16 identified as
erythematous by reviewers PR1 and PR2 respectively.

A two-way random model, intraclass correlation
coefficient for absolute agreement between all three
reviewers for the total ASEPSIS score (maximum: 18)
was 0.806 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.694, 0.881],
indicating good reliability between reviewers.[16]

There was an almost perfect agreement between the
independent photograph reviewers’ responses
(κ =0.912, p < 0.01) in terms of asking to review patients
in person.

Sensitivity and specificity
Assuming that a photographic reviewer asking for a
conventional clinical review constitutes diagnosing an
infection, sensitivity and specificity values were
calculated for each reviewer based upon patients who
were diagnosed as having had an SSI in the follow-up
period (Table 4). The specificity of this method of wound
review for diagnosing infection was found to be 90%.

###### Discussion
Telemedicine is a rapidly expanding area of modern
medicine. Studies have shown that telemedicine
consultations are acceptable to patients[17] and increasing
in prevalence and significance,[18] and so should be
considered as a viable method of conducting health
research and clinical follow-up.

Early identification of SSI may avoid the significant
impact to patients that was described during the PI


exercise as part of this study, including readmission to
hospital and prolonged treatment with antibiotics. This
impact reflects that experienced by other patients having
undergone colorectal surgery,[19] who found infections
‘devastating.’ The experience of the patients in our study
outlines not only the cost to patients but also the burden
on health-care systems, with each patient suffering SSI
requiring multiple contacts with health professionals
before, during and after their treatment.

We demonstrated good correlation between a
face-to-face clinical review and a photograph review of
a wound, when screening for SSI using a validated,
objective scoring system (Table 2 and 3), and a high
specificity for diagnosing infection (Table 3). We
propose a method of wound infection screening where
photography is used to assess the appearance of a
wound (erythema, serous exudate, purulent exudate

and wound edge separation), with a telephone call and
access to clinical records used to assess for other aspects
of the ASEPSIS score (antibiotic prescription, abscess
drainage, wound debridement, isolation of bacteria and
prolonged stay or readmission to hospital). Wounds
without complications would not require the patient to
attend hospital. Early work has shown telephone
follow-up to be reliable in screening for problems with
wounds.[20,21] Of the 53 wound reviews that took place
in this study, 46 could have been conducted using this
method of follow-up, avoiding a hospital visit in 86.7%
of cases. Therefore, digital photography may be a useful
tool where patients are unable or unwilling to attend in
person for further clinical follow-up. This is particularly
important with the increase in centralised hospital
services; distance from hospital is directly associated
with failure to attend clinic follow-up,[22] and in
specialties that run a ‘hub and spoke’ model, often
covering a very large geographical area, any strategies
aimed at reducing the travel burden to patients and
reducing loss-to-follow-up should be explored.

The patients in this PI study identified problems with
travel, hospital parking, and the short nature of hospital
visits as barriers to hospital-based follow-up. When
presented with the idea of taking photographs of their
wound to send to study doctors, in conjunction with a
short telephone consultation, all participants were in
favour of this idea. The results of this study are
supported by other studies examining telemedicine in
vascular surgery,[23] cardiology[24] and plastic surgery.[25,26]

This study supports a postoperative follow-up care
pathway whereby the clinician uses a remote
photograph and telephone interview with the patient
to assess the necessity/requirement for formal,
face-to-face, clinical review. This model provides a
‘safety-net’ for both the patient and clinician, and was
acceptable when suggested to the PI focus group. It
offers the possibility of patient-led wound monitoring,
where the patient is able to contact the medical team
with a photograph if they feel their wound has
deteriorated and warrants clinical review. In the context
of clinical trials, this makes their involvement in
research more patient-centred, which may improve
study retention rates.

The under reporting of erythema may demonstrate a
reduced visibility of colour when reviewing wound

photographs, or may be a result of the lack of

where flash is used may reduce the visibility of erythema
in images, and future research trials, or indeed use of
this method in clinical practice should aim to at least
standardise flash in images, even if aspects such as
distance from the wound are left to the discretion of
the photographer.

Other domains of assessment showed good
agreement. For example, percentage agreement in
serous exudate was consistently >90%, although this
was associated with a relatively low kappa value. Only
two wounds were assessed as having serous exudate in
person—a larger study may be necessary to validate the
results that this study has produced.

Limitations
This study has certain limitations that should be
considered. Firstly, the sensitivity of photography for
diagnosing infection is difficult to interpret as relatively
few patients (two) developed SSI. However, we can say
with more certainty that photography has high
specificity, and if used as a triage tool could be effective
at identifying wounds at very low risk of infection and
not requiring clinical review. Secondly, the photographs
used in this study were taken in clinic, by a study doctor
with a dedicated camera. Further research should firstly
aim to replicate these results on a larger scale, but with
photographs taken by patients or their carers using
easily accessible smartphone cameras. This may lead to
large-scale research trials in which models of telemedical
follow-up are cross-examined for safety, efficacy and
cost-effectiveness. Finally, the PI consultation exercise
was small, and a larger activity with more participants
could add to this work to create more robust qualitative
research.


###### Conclusion
In conclusion, we have shown that, in the assessment
of SSI, there is good correlation between face-to-face
clinical and remote photographic review, and that this
approach appears to be acceptable to patients.
Incorporating this method of wound assessment into a
postoperative follow-up care pathway may save patients
and clinicians from unnecessary hospital visits,
particularly when conducting health research. JWC

Reflective questions

- What criteria for assessing patients for surgical site infection
(SSI) can be used when reviewing patients in person?

- What ethical issues might arise as clinicians use
photographs in practice? For example, what should be
considered when sending or showing a photo of a wound to
another clinician?

- What are the potential risk factors for SSI in vascular
surgical patients?


#### Specialist wound care to help rebuild the lives of those injured in confl ict
