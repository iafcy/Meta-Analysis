### Abstract


**BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most common nosocomial infection and the**
leading cause of readmission among surgical patients. Many SSIs develop in the postdischarge
period and are inadequately recognized by patients. To address this, we developed a mobile health
protocol of remote wound monitoring using smartphone technology. The current study aims to
establish its feasibility among patients and providers.

**STUDY DESIGN: We enrolled vascular surgery patients during their inpatient stay. They were**
trained to use our mobile health application, which allowed them to transmit digital images of their
surgical wound and answer a survey about their recovery. After hospital discharge, participants
completed the application daily for 2 weeks. Providers on the inpatient team reviewed submissions
daily and contacted patients for concerning findings.


**RESULTS: Forty participants were enrolled. Forty-five percent of participants submitted data**
every day for 2 weeks, with an overall submission rate of 90.2%. Submissions were reviewed
within an average of 9.7 hours of submission, with 91.9% of submissions reviewed within 24
hours. We detected 7 wound complications with 1 false negative. Participant and provider
satisfaction was universally high.


**CONCLUSIONS: Patients and their caregivers are willing to participate in a mobile health**
program aimed at remote monitoring of postoperative recovery, and they are able to complete it
with a high level of fidelity and satisfaction. Preliminary results indicate the ability to detect and
intervene on wound complications.

-----

Surgical site infections (SSI) are the most common hospital-acquired infections among
surgical patients and the leading cause of hospital readmission after surgery.[1–3] They are
also the costliest hospital-acquired infection, with estimates ranging from $3 billion to $10
billion annually.[4,5] As postoperative lengths of stay decrease, these infections increasingly
develop between hospital discharge and routinely scheduled clinic follow-up visits.[6–8 ]

However, patients cannot identify these complications and frequently ignore or fail to
recognize the early signs of cellulitis or other wound complications.[9,10] This leads to the
common and frustrating scenario in which patients present to a routine, scheduled clinic
appointment with an advanced wound complication that requires readmission with or
without reoperation, but that might have been amenable to outpatient management if
detected earlier.


To address this gap, particularly in light of recent hospital readmission reduction policy
mandates,[11] initial efforts have explored the use of technology (ie telemedicine) as an
adjunct in the postdischarge period for continued postoperative care.[12] These efforts are
reinforced by a parallel increase in patients’ smartphone ownership and experience, which
allows communication with providers from anywhere via secure connections. In addition,
smartphones permit easy generation and sharing of images, which can allow surgical care
providers to visually inspect wounds from a distance.

However, existing research on telemedicine protocols is limited in several ways. Many
studies include only patient populations with a low baseline rate of complications and are
underpowered to demonstrate telemedicine effectiveness.[13,14] Also, novice users and
patients who do not have the necessary technology (eg Internet, computer, smartphone) are
often excluded, creating disparities in access and a biased evidence base.[15,16] Finally, studies
rarely include image-based evaluation and are not typically rigorously user-tested before
deployment.


To address this gap, we developed, pilot tested, and preliminarily evaluated a postoperative
wound monitoring protocol using smartphone images in vascular surgery patients at a
tertiary care academic facility. Vascular surgery patients have a uniquely high SSI risk, given
their compromised tissue perfusion and common comorbidities that inhibit wound healing,
such as smoking, obesity, and diabetes,[7,17] making them a high-value target for telemedicine
that involves wound monitoring. Earlier work from our group and others has established
patient enthusiasm for the protocol and widespread willingness to participate.[18,19] We have
established that smartphone digital images can be used to make diagnostic and therapeutic
decisions comparable with those made via in-person evaluation.[20] We then rigorously usertested our application (app) to optimize its accessibility with our largely novice target patient
population.[21] The aim of the current study was to demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol
for patients, their caregivers, and inpatient clinical staff.

### METHODS


**Study sample**

We recruited English-speaking inpatients 18 years of age or older on the vascular surgery
service at a large, academic tertiary care hospital between June 8, 2016 and November 15,

2016. Eligible patients had a surgical incision longer than 3 cm and no identifying marks (eg
tattoos) in the area of the incision. Patients with major cognitive or neurologic deficits that
prohibited their independent participation were eligible if they had a caregiver to serve as
their proxy. To complete enrollment and protocol training, patients needed to be in the
hospital for at least 2 days after giving consent. This excluded most patients who underwent
carotid operations, as these patients typically leave the day after operation at our institution.
Subjects who met inclusion criteria were consecutively approached to participate. We
recorded stated reasons for declining participation.

Patients who consented to participate provided information about their earlier smartphone
familiarity, including whether they owned a smartphone and whether they had ever used a
smartphone to take a picture.


**Intervention**


The University of Wisconsin Health Sciences IRB approved the study protocol. The full
protocol has been published previously.[22]

WoundCheck is a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996-compliant,
internally developed, and user-tested iOS app that enables patients to transmit daily surgical
wound images and symptom information from their home or post-acute care facility to a
clinician involved with the inpatient vascular surgery service, either a nurse practitioner or a
physician member of the research team (Fig. 1).[21] There are 2 phases of the app: an imagetaking phase in which participants take up to 4 digital images of their surgical wound, and a
brief survey of yes or no questions about recovery, with particular attention paid to the
surgical wound. Survey questions were developed based on earlier work from our group
validating smartphone digital images for postoperative wound monitoring and were designed
to capture information not as easily appreciated from images, such as drainage and odor.[20 ]


Submission of data happens automatically on app completion.

During the postoperative inpatient stay, participants underwent tailored training to learn to
use the Wound-Check app. Novice smartphone users received additional dedicated training
to become comfortable navigating the iPhone. We measured in minutes the amount of time
required to complete training. After training, participants or their caregiver completed the
System Usability Scale, a validated scale to measure the ease of use for technology
platforms, to evaluate their comfort with the app. At the completion of training, participants
received an iPhone 5S, as well as an accompanying visual reference guide for participants
who needed additional reminders about how to use the phone and app. This device was
theirs to keep at the conclusion of the study. Each device cost $0.99 with an associated data
plan of $41.56/month. Reference guides cost $9 per participant, bringing the total material
cost per participant to $51.55.


On the day of discharge, participants underwent a reminder training session, during which
they completed the app to provide baseline information. After discharge, they were asked to
complete the app and transmit data daily for 14 days. They were encouraged to choose a
well-lit place in their home and to use the app in that location each day at roughly the same
time of day, to provide consistent light for ease of comparison. Research personnel called

participants at the following time points: if they missed a day of submission; if their images
were insufficient for review; at 6 days after discharge to provide technical support, answer
any questions, and ensure continued consent; and at the completion of the protocol to obtain
final feedback and complete an exit survey.

Each afternoon, a clinician on the inpatient vascular surgery service (a nurse practitioner or a
physician member of the research team) reviewed submitted images and survey responses
and filled out a validated checklist documenting the appearance of the surgical wound, using
an internally developed review interface.[20] Nurse practitioners were chosen for this role
because they were familiar with participants during their inpatient stay before discharge and
were determined to be best able to provide continuity of care. If the nurse practitioner
detected concerning findings on image review or in survey responses, they called the
participant to obtain additional information and make recommendations for additional care
as indicated, which could include returning to the clinic or hospital. If nurse practitioners
were unable to review submissions due to time constraints, a physician member of the
research team reviewed submissions the following morning. At the time of this study, there
was no inpatient nurse practitioner coverage on the weekend; this same physician member of
the research team completed submission reviews during the weekend.


**Measures**

### RESULTS


The primary end points of this pilot trial were participant adherence to and satisfaction with
the protocol and the burden of the protocol on clinician workflow. Measures of participant
adherence included the percent of participants who submitted data daily without requiring a
reminder phone call, and the number of days missed among participants who missed at least
1 day of submission. Participant satisfaction was measured via semi-structured interviews at
study completion with all participants. The burden to clinician workflow was measured by
the amount of time required to review images. Additionally, semi-structured interviews with
each nurse practitioner evaluated provider buy-in and satisfaction.

Secondary outcomes included surgical site infection (SSI) detection and hospital
readmission. Surgical site infections detected by the protocol, the postdischarge day of
detection, and the clinical response were recorded. Surgical site infections not detected by
the protocol were also tracked. Patient self-report during the exit survey, as well as chart
review from our institution, provided information about hospital readmission. A surgeon
member of the research team performed manual abstraction of data from the medical record
to collect wound complications and hospital readmissions. Participants were followed for the
30 days after hospital discharge from their index admission.

**Patient characteristics**

Between June 6 and November 15, 2016, one hundred and forty-one patients were screened,
69 of which were approached for participation. Nine of these were unable to complete the
protocol independently and had no caregiver to assist. Of 60 eligible patients, 47 patients

(78%) were enrolled (Fig. 2). Stated reasons for declining to participate included being
overwhelmed with postoperative care, being uninterested in learning new technology, and
hesitation about participating in research. Five participants withdrew consent, in each
instance due to the patient or their caregiver being overwhelmed with the other aspects of
their recovery and not wanting to perform another task. Two protocol violations occurred: 1
related to incorrect training by a research personnel and 1 due to an irreparable device
failure.

Of the 40 participants who were fully enrolled and completed the 14-day protocol, the
majority were male and white (Table 1), which is consistent with the vascular surgery patient
population at our institution. Twenty-two (55%) participants traveled more than 50 miles to
receive care at our institution, and participants were not scheduled for routine follow-up
until an average of 2 weeks after hospital discharge. The majority of participants had a
caregiver to assist them (Table 1). In 32.5% of cases, neither the patient nor their caregiver,
if they had one, had experience with smartphone technology.


**Training and protocol completion**

Training participants to use the device and complete the WoundCheck app required an
average of 16.9 minutes (Table 2). Participants found the app very user-friendly, with an
average System Usability Scale score of 87.2 (scored out of 100; scores higher than 68 are
considered above average by industry standards).


Forty-five percent of participants (18 of 40) submitted data every day for the full 2 weeks
(Table 2). Those that did not missed an average of 1.4 days, giving an overall daily
submission rate of 90.2% (505 of 560 days, given 40 participants submitting data for 14
days). Of the 55 missed days, 6 (10.9%) were on the first day, 9 (16.4%) were on the last
day, and 17 (30.9%) were during a weekend.


**Clinical service line integration**

On average, nurse practitioners reviewed submitted data 580.5 minutes (mean 9.7 hours,
median 7.1 hours) after submission (Table 2). Of the 160 days that participants submitted
data, 139 (86.9%) were reviewed per protocol by a nurse practitioner; a physician member
of the research team reviewed submissions on the remaining days; 91.9% of submissions
(464 of 505) were reviewed within 24 hours.


When interviewed, the nurse practitioners were positive about the protocol, saying that “the
patients who participated…seemed enthusiastic about it,” “the pictures were helpful,” and “I
really think there’s a lot of merit to these pictures.” However, they struggled to find time in
their day that was required to do submission review, in addition to the clinical work they
were already doing for the inpatient service.


**Participant satisfaction**

Participants were universally positive in their exit interviews. Common themes from the exit
interviews included feeling more secure knowing that a provider was monitoring their
wound, avoiding unnecessary travel to be evaluated, and finding the app easy to use. Six

participants wished there had been a free text or comment section to add more detail to their
survey responses beyond yes or no, or to ask a question about the appearance of the wound.
Four participants had difficulty submitting data due to poor cell service. One participant
suggested adding a mechanism to notify patients that their submissions had been reviewed
by a provider, and a record of past submissions so they could be sure their data had been
transmitted successfully.


**Clinical outcomes**

There were a total of 8 SSIs in the patient cohort, 7 of which were detected using images and
survey responses from our app (Table 3). There were no false positives. There was one false
negative in a patient whose infection was detected at an early follow-up visit on
postdischarge day 5; the corresponding image from that day did not demonstrate an obvious
infection. Of the 7 patients diagnosed by our protocol, 6 had their infections successfully
managed as outpatients. In 4 cases, patients were brought back to clinic and were
successfully treated far in advance of their regularly scheduled follow-up. Two of the 6 were
readmitted, but for reasons unrelated to their SSI. One patient fell on his amputation stump
several days after we detected and treated his SSI, and he returned to the operating room for
a traumatic wound dehiscence, not for his SSI. Another patient had been readmitted on postdischarge day 2 to an outside facility due to respiratory failure, and he and his caregiver
continued to submit images. He developed peri-incisional erythema around his groin
incision on postdischarge day 15, and our vascular surgeons spoke with the inpatient team at
the other facility to coordinate appropriate wound care and an antibiotic regimen. The final
patient had early detection of their SSI, but their case is perhaps an illustration that not all
readmissions for SSI are preventable. This patient’s SSI was detected by the protocol, and he
was sent to the emergency department where he received appropriate antibiotic therapy.
However, the SSI did not completely resolve with this regimen, and he required operative
management and IV antibiotics in an inpatient setting.


### DISCUSSION

Traditional care of surgical patients in the postdischarge period involves little contact
between patients and providers in the period between hospital discharge and routine clinic
follow-up. This period is one during which patients are at significant risk of complications
developing, SSI chief among them, that increase their likelihood of hospital readmission.[6,23 ]

Importantly, among vascular surgery patients, SSIs are up to 5 times more likely to occur
after discharge than before discharge, making patients particularly vulnerable post discharge.
24 However, patients often cannot recognize the onset of these complications early enough to
facilitate outpatient management, given their lack of clinical experience and their reported
feeling of being overwhelmed in assuming self-care after discharge.[10,18]


As complex surgical care is increasingly regionalized, patients often must travel great
distance to see their operating surgeon when they are already ill-equipped to self-diagnose
postoperative complications, creating the potential for additional delays in care.[25–27] More
than half of participants in our study traveled more than 50 miles to receive care at our
institution, a significant barrier to seeking care outside of scheduled visits. Indeed,

participants frequently asked whether they could wait for their scheduled clinic visits when
we called them about concerning findings detected by our protocol. Many expressed in their
exit interview that a benefit of participation was reducing unnecessary clinic visits. Their
responses generally indicated a reluctance to travel unless absolutely necessary.

Due to the vulnerability of the postdischarge period, the distance patients must travel for
care, and hospital readmission reduction mandates, several telemedicine protocols have been
developed to improve the care of patients in the outpatient setting after hospital discharge.
These protocols harness the recent explosion in personal technology that allows for delivery
of care remotely, which was not possible only a few years ago. However, many of them set
out to replace in-person follow-up, which alleviates the burden associated with traveling
long distances, but does not substantively increase the likelihood of detecting or intervening
on complications at an earlier date.[13,28–30]


We developed WoundCheck, through collaboration with our community partners, and
rigorously user-tested it, to address this gap in existing mobile health platforms.[19,21] In this
study, we demonstrated the feasibility of this protocol of continual monitoring of
postoperative recovery in the postdischarge period among vascular surgery patients using
smartphones. We have demonstrated that a population of complex and high-risk patients,
many of whom are older adults and novice smartphone users, can complete this protocol
with high fidelity and satisfaction.

Our protocol and those like it allow patients to be in better communication with their
provider, which patients have consistently identified as a priority.[18,19] On completion of the
protocol, participant satisfaction was near universal. They repeatedly stated feelings of
reassurance that we were monitoring their recovery and that they were not solely responsible
for detecting a problem and alerting the care team. They also reiterated how simple it was to
complete the app, which was further evidenced in their high scores on the System Usability
Scale at the time of training. Other studies of mobile health protocols in the postdischarge
period have demonstrated widespread enthusiasm and satisfaction from participants,
reinforcing their appeal to a majority of surgical patients.[31,32]


Our provider team was also enthusiastic about the protocol, although they found it placed an
additional strain on their already full clinical responsibilities. The concerns about program
sustainability raised by the nurse practitioners echo findings from similar work done
examining implementation of readmission reduction programs. Many of the programs
proven effective have involved dedicated transition coordinators in the pre- and
postdischarge periods.[33–36] These programs highlight the significant additional work
required to optimize transitions of care. To be successful, one cannot simply add this work to
already burdened staff. However, none of these protocols has leveraged smartphone
technology to transmit visual information, which is of vital importance for preventing
readmissions among surgical patients, given the high frequency of readmissions attributed to
wound complications.[1] Our protocol of postdischarge wound monitoring provides valuable
information not otherwise available to providers, but we readily recognize that its success
and sustainability depend on integration into dedicated transitional care programs.

Although this study was not designed to evaluate efficacy, our findings about clinical
outcomes related to this protocol were quite encouraging. The protocol appeared to be
effective in the early detection of wound complications, allowing earlier treatment and
potentially preventing hospital readmission and reoperation. These results might represent a
marked improvement over current standard of care. At a per-user cost of $51.55, this
protocol could yield significant cost savings, if successful at reducing hospital readmissions
and other resource-intensive therapies for SSI, given an average wound-related readmission
cost of nearly $30,000.[37] Larger, randomized studies with a control group are necessary to
perform robust cost-effectiveness analyses to support these hypotheses, although similar
results from other research groups are encouraging about the use and effectiveness of mobile
health protocols in the postdischarge care of surgical patients.[28,32]

An important component of our protocol was the provision of smartphones to all
participants. In line with the NIH American College of Surgeons summit on surgical
disparities research, one of our priorities was to not create disparities of access based on
smartphone ownership.[38,39] This sets our program apart, as many existing mobile health
protocols rely on participants’ ownership of and familiarity with the technology involved.[12 ]

Had we adopted this strategy, 32.5% of our participants would have been excluded. Future
mobile health protocols should consider the availability of the required technology among
their patient population and make every effort to ensure that this does not exclude the very
patients who stand to benefit the most. Importantly, novice users learned to use the device
and the app with little difficulty and completed the protocol as effectively as those
participants who had experience with smartphone technology. This indicates that novice
users are capable of participating in mobile health protocols with relatively little investment.


The app used in the protocol, WoundCheck, is iOS-compatible, but not Android-compatible.
We did this because iOS apps are usually backwards compatible with older models of
iPhone (which have the added advantage of a relatively consistent shape and layout), but this
is less consistently true with Android apps.[40] For the purposes of the current study, we
provided iPhones for participants to use, but future iterations of the protocol would ideally
use participants’ devices, if they have them, and, as such, should be compatible across
operating systems. Not only would this preclude participants who have Android devices
from needing to learn another platform, it would improve accessibility of the protocol to
Android device owners. This is crucial for wide accessibility, particularly because
individuals with lower income and lower educational attainment are more likely to own an
Android device.[41]

This study has several limitations. We performed this study on a small sample of a relatively
homogeneous patient population, which potentially limits its generalizability. Of particular
note is the fact that nearly all participants were white, and there are few data on its
effectiveness in patients of darker skin tones. However, although many existing mobile
health protocols for post-discharge care have confirmed their feasibility in low-risk
populations, most of whom have experience with the technology involved, we have
demonstrated that a population of high-risk patients, many of whom are novice users, are
also capable of participating in a mobile health protocol with high fidelity. This is an
important addition to the growing body of literature about mobile health technology for

postdischarge care of surgical patients. In future studies, we plan to include a diverse patient
population in terms of baseline postoperative complication risk, sociodemographics, and
familiarity with the necessary technology.


### CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we have demonstrated that patients and providers can complete an image-based
smartphone protocol for continued postdischarge monitoring of postoperative recovery with
a high level of fidelity and satisfaction. Additionally, we have provided compelling evidence
of this protocol’s potential clinical effectiveness in diagnosing and treating wound
complications earlier than the current standard of care, which involves little patient contact
between hospital discharge and clinic follow-up.
