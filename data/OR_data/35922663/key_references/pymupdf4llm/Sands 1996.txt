Although surgical site infections (SSIs) occurring after hospital discharge cause substantial mor-
bidity, their epidemiology is not well understood, and methods for routine postdischarge surveillance
have not been validated. Inpatient and outpatient surveillance followed 5572 nonobstetric procedures
among ll)embers of a health maintenance organization with extensive automated records. Records
were screened for coded diagnoses, tests, and prescriptions and, if positive, were reviewed by reading
full text. Questionnaires regarding the occurrence of an SSI were sent to the same patients and
their surgeons. One hundred thirty-two SSIs were documented, of which 84% occurred after hospital
discharge and 63% were managed outside the surgical facility. Postdischarge SSIs led to an average
of 4.6 additional ambulatory encounters. Patient and surgeon questionnaires had a sensitivity of
28% and 15%, respectively. These data suggest that most SSIs occur after discharge and are not
detectable by conventional surveillance. Nonetheless, they cause substantial resource utilization.

Postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the comparisons of rates between hospitals, these infections must
