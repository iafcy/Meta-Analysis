**_BACKGROUND:_** Surgical site infection is common
following colorectal surgery, yet the incidence varies
widely. CDC criteria include “diagnosis by attending
physician,” which can be subjective. Alternatively, the
ASEPSIS score is an objective scoring system based on the
presence of clinical findings.

**_OBJECTIVE:_** The aim of this study is to compare the
interrater reliability of the ASEPSIS score vs CDC
definitions in identifying surgical site infection.


definitions. The interrater reliability of ASEPSIS and
the CDC criteria were compared by using the κ statistic.
These data were also compared with the institutional
National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
database.

**_RESULTS:_** One hundred seventy-one patients were
included. Four surgical site infections (2.4%) were
identified by the National Surgical Quality Improvement
Program. Data from the surgeons demonstrated
significantly higher yet discrepant rates of infection
by the CDC criteria, at 6.2%, 7.4%, and 14.1% with
a κ of 0.55 indicating modest interrater agreement.
Alternatively, the ASEPSIS assessments demonstrated
excellent interrater agreement between surgeons with
96% agreement (2.4%, 2.4%, and 3.6%) and a κ of 0.83.


**_DESIGN:_** This 24-month prospective study used serial
photography of the wound. Three attending surgeons
independently reviewed blinded photographic/clinical data.

**_SETTINGS:_** This study was conducted at an academic
institution.


**_PATIENTS:_** Patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery
were selected.

**_INTERVENTIONS:_** Surgeons assigned an ASEPSIS score
and identified surgical site infection by using CDC


**Funding/Support: This work was funded by the American Society of**
Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) Research Foundation, Career Development Award.

**Financial Disclosures: None reported.**


**_LIMITATIONS:_** This was a single-institution study.

**_CONCLUSIONS:_** This study demonstrates the relatively
poor reliability of CDC definitions for surgical site
infections in comparison with an objective scoring
system. These findings could explain the wide variability
in the literature and raise concern for the comparison
of institutional surgical site infection rates as a quality
indicator. Alternatively, an objective scoring system, like
the ASEPSIS score, may yield more reliable measures for
comparison.

throughout the literature when prospective collection methods are used[2–4] and varies widely from 5% to 40%.[5,6] Understandably, there will be variability based on case mix and
patient demographics. However, this discrepancy raises questions surrounding the difficulty in accurately defining SSI.

One of the key criteria in the CDC definition is “diagnosis by attending physician,” leaving the attending surgeon
as the final arbiter. Previously, we demonstrated poor reliability between attending surgeons in defining SSI using
CDC criteria based on blinded chart review of the electronic medical record (EMR).[7] However, it was unclear whether
the discrepancy related to differences in interpretation of
documentation or true differences in clinical interpretation.

Alternatively, the ASEPSIS score is an objective woundscoring system, previously described in cardiac surgery,
based on the presence of specific clinical findings.[8] The
ASEPSIS score has the advantage of being objective and is
designed to relate the wound appearance to clinical consequences. In addition, it provides a quantitative analysis that
can be used to grade the severity of the wound disturbance.

The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the interrater reliability of the CDC definitions and the ASEPSIS
score in identifying SSIs. We hypothesize that there will
be poor interrater reliability between surgeons in defining
SSI based on CDC definitions and that the ASEPSIS score
will provide a more reliable and quantifiable mechanism
for defining SSI in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

#### MATERIALS AND METHODS


Three surgeons reviewed the prospectively gathered
data (complete with photographs) individually and independently. All identifying information was removed so the
reviewers were completely blinded. Reviewers classified
each wound with the use of CDC definitions for SSI. Reviewers also assigned an ASEPSIS score to each wound assessment to generate a cumulative 30-day ASEPSIS score.

Secondary clinical variables were collected including
patient and procedure demographic variables, length of
stay, 30-day readmission, and 30-day morbidity/mortality
from the prospectively collected database and the institutional ACS NSQIP database. NSQIP data are abstracted on
all procedures included in the colectomy and proctectomy
modules in the Targeted Procedure Program.

**_CDC Definition of SSI_**
ACS NSQIP uses the CDC’s National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) system,[9] which classifies SSIs
into incision or organ/space. Incisional SSIs are further
divided into those involving only skin and subcutaneous
tissues (superficial SSI) and deeper softer tissues (deep
SSI) (Table 1). According to the CDC, “NNIS definitions
of SSIs have been applied consistently by surveillance and
surgical personnel in many settings and currently are a de
facto national standard.” CDC definitions were reviewed
with the surgeons before the review, and each case file was
associated with a copy of the CDC definitions to aid during the review process. We did not include organ/space
SSIs given their inherent difference from incisional SSIs.


**_Study Design_**
A 24-month (November 29, 2012 to November 30, 2014)
prospective observational study was undertaken at the University of Virginia under informed consent with permission
to obtain and publish deidentified information including
photographs of the wound (IRB # 16097). Adult patients
(≥18 years) undergoing elective colorectal procedures by 1
of 2 colorectal surgeons were consented and prospectively
followed by a clinical research coordinator. Emergent procedures, patients younger than 18, prisoners, pregnant women, and patients unable to provide consent were excluded.
Patients were identified in the outpatient clinic and
approached for informed consent after the decision was
made to proceed with surgery. The clinical research coordinator followed the patients and maintained a prospective database including digital photographic images of
each patient’s wound. The patient’s wound was photographed every other day beginning after postoperative day
2 during his/her inpatient stay, and at any follow-up visits
up to 30-days or until wound healing. Clinical data, such
as whether or not the wound had been opened, the presence of drainage, and treatment with antibiotics, were collected independently from what was documented in the
EMR at each wound assessment.


**_ASEPSIS Score_**
The ASEPSIS score is calculated by assigning a score based
on the presence of erythema, serous exudate, purulent
exudate, and deep tissue separation according to the percentage of the wound affected by each process (Table 2).
Additional points are awarded for antibiotic treatment, incision and drainage, isolation of bacteria from the wound,
and an inpatient stay. The addition of home health for the
purposes of wound care was added to the score as a modification to reflect current practice. A score greater than 20
defines a SSI. Scores are grouped into 4 categories (satisfactory (0–10), disturbance of healing (11–20), minor SSI
(21–30), moderate SSI (31–40), severe SSI (>40)).

**_Analysis_**
The primary outcome of interest was the interrater reliability of the CDC definition of a superficial or deep SSI
between the 3 surgeons and the institutional NSQIP database. A secondary outcome of the study was the interrater
reliability of the ASEPSIS score in identifying SSI. Wound
evaluations were compared between the 3 surgeons and
NSQIP. Patient, procedure, and wound variables were
evaluated in cases of disagreement to determine predictive factors of disagreement. In addition, because the

tissue of the incision and at least one of the following:

   - Purulent drainage, with or without laboratory confirmation, from the superficial incision.

   - Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the superficial incision.

   - At least one of the following signs or symptoms of infection: pain or tenderness, localized swelling, redness, or heat AND superficial incision
is deliberately opened by the surgeon, unless incision is culture negative.

Do not report the following conditions as SSI:

   - Stitch abscess (minimal inflammation and discharge confined to the points of suture penetration).

   - Infected burn wound.

   - Incisional SSI that extends into the fascial and muscle layers (see deep incisional SSI).
**_Deep infection occurs within 30 days and the infection appears to be related to the operation and infection involved deep soft tissues (eg,_**

   - Purulent drainage from the deep incision but not from the organ/space component of the surgical site.

   - A deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon when the patient has at least one of the following signs or
symptoms: fever (>38°C), localized pain, or tenderness, unless site is culture negative.

   - An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision is found on direct examination, during reoperation, or by
histopathologic or radiologic examination.

number of assessments was not uniform for each patient
based on differences in the length of stay and frequency of
follow-up visits, we evaluated this as a potential contributor to discordance. The χ[2] statistic and student t test were
used to compare categorical and continuous variables.

The interrater reliability of the CDC definition of
SSI was compared between the 3 surgeon reviewers and
ACS NSQIP by using the weighted generalized κ statistic.[10] The surgeons also calculated a cumulative 30-day
ASEPSIS score for each patient based on the clinical and


­photographic data collected at each wound assessment.
The interrater reliability of the ASEPSIS score was also
compared by using the weighted generalized κ statistic.

The κ statistic is a commonly used measure of the reliability of paired measures with nominal or ordinal scales. The
Fleiss generalized weighted κ extends the statistic to multirater comparisons (3 or more raters) with scores for nominal or
ordinal categories. Weights are included to adjust for differences in the scale of disagreement between ordinal scale values. The weighted generalized κ statistic measures how much

the level of agreement among raters exceeds the amount of
agreement expected by chance alone. In general, κ statistic
values of >0.7 indicate excellent interrater agreement.

A power analysis with continuity correction was
performed based on the authors’ previous study, which
demonstrated an NSQIP institutional SSI rate of 8% and
an average surgeon SSI rate of 25% among the same 3
surgeon reviewers. The power analysis indicated that a total sample of 170 would be needed to detect a difference
from 25% to 8% in the incidence of SSI with 80% power
with α at 0.05.

#### RESULTS


One hundred ninety-two patients were consented during the study period. Twenty-one patients were excluded
from analysis, leaving 171 patients in the final analysis:
1 patient was lost to follow-up, 1 patient died in the immediate postoperative period, 2 patients withdrew consent before surgery, 6 patients were consented but did not undergo
surgery, and 11 patients were not captured by NSQIP. The


complete demographic data for the final study population
are presented in Table 3.

**_CDC Definition_**
NSQIP identified 3 patients with a superficial SSI (1.8%)
and 1 patient with a deep SSI (0.6%) in the study group.
Data from the 3 surgeons demonstrated significantly
higher (p < 0.001) rates of SSI by CDC criteria in comparison with the institutional NSQIP database. In addition, the rates of SSI were significantly different between
each of the 3 surgeon reviewers at 6.2% (3.7% superficial, 2.5% deep), 7.4% (7.4% superficial), and 14.1%
(9.2% superficial, 4.9% deep) (p < 0.001). There was
91.2% agreement between the 3 surgeon reviewers and
NSQIP with a κ of 0.55 indicating relatively poor interrater agreement.

Table 4 represents a detailed outline of cases with an
SSI identified by at least 1 reviewer. The data presented
in the table were collected from the prospectively maintained database independent of what was documented
in the EMR. The next to last column in the table describes what was actually documented in the EMR. All
3 surgeons agreed there was a SSI in 3 NSQIP-identified
superficial SSIs; however, 2 of these SSIs were classified
as deep by at least 1 of the surgeons. None of the surgeons identified a SSI in the patient identified as having a
deep SSI by NSQIP (case D). This patient developed diffuse erythema around each laparoscopic site prompting
evaluation by the treating surgeon. A CT scan revealed
fat stranding in the subcutaneous tissue but no fluid collection. The surgeon documented the findings were not
consistent with an SSI. The patient’s primary care physician subsequently placed the patient on antibiotics, and a
deep SSI was identified by NSQIP. The patient’s wounds
at the time of evaluation are depicted in Figure 1.

Six patients not identified by NSQIP as having a SSI
were identified by all 3 of the surgeons independently as
having a SSI (Table 4, cases E–J). In each case, the wound
had been deliberately opened. The wound of patient J is
seen in Figure 2. On postoperative day 9, this patient was
ordered to receive antibiotics for “cellulitis versus wound
infection,” which was charted in the EMR, and staples were
removed from the wound. The following day the physician
note states “no purulent drainage, erythema has improved
slightly since staples were removed.” The patient remained
in the hospital for several more days where documentation
only states “wound open and packed.” The photograph in
Figure 2 was taken the day before discharge. Ten additional
superficial SSIs were identified by surgeon 3, but not by
the other 2 surgeons. Each of these patients had either erythema or was placed on antibiotics by their primary care
physician. Surgeon 3 captured 1 additional deep SSI that
was not identified by the other 2 surgeons or NSQIP. This
patient presented with bleeding from the midline wound.

According to the progress notes, the wound was “opened
at the bedside and hematoma evacuated from the wound.”

In total, there was only 1 case in which all 3 surgeons and
NSQIP fully agreed with regard to the CDC definition and
only 2 additional situations where all 3 surgeons fully agreed
with 1 another. Documentation was generally thought to account for the lower rate of SSI identified in NSQIP.


Table 5 demonstrates comparisons of patient, procedure, and wound factors in patients with SSI disagreement. In addition to the difference in wound factors, BMI
was the only patient factor associated with disagreement.
Patients with disagreement have statistically higher BMIs
than those without disagreement. The number of assessments did not predict disagreement.

**_ASEPSIS Criteria_**
The breakdown of ASEPSIS scores for each reviewer is seen in
Figure 3. There was 95.7% agreement with ASEPSIS between
the 3 surgeons with a κ of 0.83 indicating excellent interrater
agreement. Four patients had scores greater than 20 (indicative of a SSI by ASEPSIS criteria) from all 3 surgeons. The average ASEPSIS score for these 4 patients was 33.0. Each of these

between NSQIP and the surgeon reviewers in the presence of an
incisional SSI. This patient was identified as having an incisional SSI by
all 3 of the surgeons independently but not by NSQIP. NSQIP = National
Surgical Quality Improvement Program; SSI = surgical site infection.


The current study demonstrates relatively poor interrater reliability among 3 attending surgeons in identifying
SSI according to CDC criteria, particularly in patients
with obesity. Compared with our previous study, which
relied on documentation in the EMR, the addition of photographic data in the current study indicates that these
surgeons, despite looking at the same wound, could not
reliably agree on the presence of an SSI.

**_Clinical Implications_**
The potential discrepancy in accurately defining SSI has significant implications. These findings could explain the wide
variability reported in the literature with regard to SSI following colorectal surgery. However, it also highlights the limitations inherent to using institutional SSI rates as a reliable
marker of quality. Increasingly, deep and organ space SSIs
to a greater extent than superficial SSIs following colorectal
surgery are tied to quality. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services requires hospitals to report deep and organ space
SSIs after colon surgery through the National Healthcare
Safety Network. In ­addition, the rate of SSI following colectomy for each institution is now available on the Hospital
Compare Web site. Ju et al[6] investigated the discrepancies in


patients was determined to have an SSI by the use of CDC
criteria by the surgeon reviewers but only one by NSQIP. Of
note, the average ASEPSIS score for the 4 patients identified
as having an SSI by NSQIP was 15. Two additional patients
received a score greater than 20 by 1 surgeon: 1 patient was
thought to have an SSI by CDC criteria by 2 surgeons, and the
other was thought to have an SSI by CDC criteria by 1 surgeon
alone. The average ASEPSIS score of the 3 surgeons for each
patient is depicted in the last column of Table 4.

ACS NSQIP is among the most reliable surgical outcomes
database. Shiloach et al[11] and Davis et al[12] demonstrated greater than 95% and 98% interrater agreement between auditors
and clinical reviewers who are trained in data collection. However, this was based on reviews of what was documented in the
EMR. Unlike a urinary tract infection or deep vein thrombosis, where the definition is based on objective data, SSI is based
entirely on the physical examination findings documented in
the EMR. Therefore, SSI is particularly vulnerable to omissions in documentation. This was clearly demonstrated in our
study, because the majority of omissions by NSQIP were due
to the lack of clear documentation leading to a very low rate of
SSI in the NSQIP database. As a result, institutions that provide detailed documentation of the wounds may actually have
higher rates of SSI than other centers where the documentation is less robust. This type of bias cannot be quantified or
controlled for between institutions and may, in fact, provide a
disincentive for accurate documentation.

Alternatively, an objective scoring system, such as the
ASEPSIS score, which allows for objective stratification of
the wound may prove more useful in overcoming the subjective interpretation of the physical examination findings
inherent in defining SSI. A study undertaken in Turkey of
patients undergoing elective or emergency colorectal surgery performed surveillance of the surgical wound with
the ASEPSIS method. The authors found that 47.7% of all
wounds developed some delay in healing. However, 17.6%
met criteria for an SSI by using an ASEPSIS score greater
than 20 points indicative of infection. (Abstract presented at

18th World Congress of the International Associated of Surgeons and Gastroenterologists, October 2008.) Therefore, it
is possible that an objective scoring system, much like the
ASEPSIS score, may improve documentation by providing
a template that could be incorporated into the EMR.

**_Strengths and Limitations_**
The primary strength of the current study is that, to the authors’ knowledge, this is the only known prospective blinded evaluation addressing the identification of SSI using
photographic data in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. However, we are limited in that this was a single-institution study involving 3 surgeons, and further validation
is needed. In addition, the ASEPSIS score itself, although
seemingly less vulnerable to subjective interpretation, is
not an ideal clinical tool. It includes variables that may be
superfluous such as the presence of serous exudate and the
use of antibiotics, which in our study were prescribed liberally. It only takes into account the percentage of the affected wound rather than the length of the incision, which
is important in laparoscopy. A SSI involving a 1-cm port
site that must be opened incurs much less morbidity than a
20-cm midline laparotomy wound.

A further limitation that became apparent during the
study is that the ASEPSIS score is cumbersome to collect
and may not be clinically viable unless modified for simplicity. Ultimately, the morbidity incurred by the development
of an SSI is in the care and the long-term implications of an
open wound. Unfortunately, an unintended consequence
of the focus on SSI has been that wounds considered “high
risk” are now deliberately left open by many surgeons to
“prevent” SSI, leaving the patient with the very outcome
we are trying to prevent. Based on the authors’ opinion,
the most clinically applicable data in the ASEPSIS scoring
system pertains to the objective evaluation of whether the
wound was opened and the length of the wound affected.
A modified scoring system based on these 2 key criteria has
the potential to improve the accuracy of uniformly capturing SSI and is an avenue for further study.

Finally, it should be noted that the rates of SSI in the
current study are significantly lower than in our preliminary study from which the power calculation was derived.
A significant quality initiative, based on the implementation
of a standardized enhanced recovery protocol, was initiated
during the study period. This was associated with a significant reduction in overall complications including SSI.[13] It is
unlikely that the reduction in the incidence of SSI affected
the results of the current study, because it should have no
bearing on the methodology for defining SSI.


toward the development of an objective measure of SSI.
Given the discrepancy in defining SSI based on subjective
interpretation of physical examination findings, poor documentation in the EMR, as well as the unintended consequence of prophylactically leaving more wounds open, it
may be more logical to simply measure whether a wound
is open and, if so, the length of this open wound as a quality
metric. This could be tracked using photodocumentation of
the wound in the EMR and subject to independent objective review. Although there is no doubt that transparency in
quality outcomes is important and can significantly improve
patient care, it must be founded on sound data, which, as
this study suggests, is difficult to define in the current system.
