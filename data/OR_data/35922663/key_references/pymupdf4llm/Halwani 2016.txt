**INTRODUCTION**


**_Objective: To assess how enhanced postdischarge telephone follow-up calls would improve case finding_**
for surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance after cesarean section.
**_Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of all patients who delivered by cesarean section_**
between April 22 and August 22, 2010. In addition to our routine surveillance, using clinical databases
and electronic patient records, we also made follow-up calls to the patients at 7, 14, and 30 days
postoperation. A standard questionnaire with questions about symptoms of SSI, health-seeking behaviors, and treatment received was administered. Descriptive statistics and univariate analysis were performed
to assess the effect of the enhanced surveillance.

Using the call as a gold standard, the sensitivity of the standard methodology to capture SSI was 73.3%.
The duration of the calls ranged from 1 to 5 minutes and were well received by the patients.

Surgical site infection (SSI) after cesarean section is 1 of the major
infections that can affect patients who undergo a cesarean section
(C-section) procedure.[1] Surveillance of this group of patients is vital
to detect the rates of infections and those that are preventable.[2] Although most hospitals have an in-hospital surveillance program, they
usually do not detect discharged patients with SSIs. Therefore, patients who develop an SSI outside the hospital might be missed.[3,4]

Consequently, the true rates of SSI in obstetric patients will most
probably be underestimated.[5] Recently, there has been interest in

improving postdischarge surveillance for SSIs. Most of the studies
conclude that postdischarge surveillance is a very useful tool that
can identify SSIs not detected during hospitalization.[2,6-10] Moreover, these studies clearly state that between 50% and 71% of post–
C-section SSIs are missed when effective postdischarge surveillance
systems are not put in place.[4] Other studies demonstrate that
C-section SSI rates are considerably underestimated if the observation time was limited only to the hospital stay.[4,11] To this end,
postdischarge surveillance for SSI after C-section would enhance the
estimate of the true incidence rate of SSI. The challenge is to identify a method that can be applied universally to detect those missing
instances of SSI. A variety of postdischarge surveillance methods
after C-section have been used but most of them mainly encourage patients to come back to the same hospital or track patients
through integrated and sophisticated databases that capture outpatient clinic visits or when they are given antibiotics through an
outpatient pharmacy.[12] Most institutions do not have access to these
types of databases.

Nevertheless, the sensitivity of postdischarge surveillance for
post–C-section SSI has not been rigorously evaluated. The aim of
this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the
current surveillance methodology for post–C-section SSI at Johns
Hopkins Hospital and to test the feasibility of enhanced surveillance using telephone follow-up calls.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

During the predischarge period, trained infection preventionists
identify post–C-section SSIs as a part of the hospital’s standard surveillance program using clinical databases and electronic patient
records. They were defined using the National Healthcare Safety
Network/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria.[13] Moreover, between April and August 2010, all patients who underwent
C-section delivery were informed in writing that a hospital staff
member would contact them after discharge. Telephone followup calls were made to all patients at 7, 14, and 30 days after the
procedure. On the day of the follow-up call, the study’s investigator made 1 attempt to contact each patient during 3 distinct time
windows: 9 AM-12 PM, 12 PM-3 PM, and 3 PM-6 PM. Only patients who were not reached during the first call were called again
for the second or third time. If the patient did not answer any of
the 3 calls, no further attempts were made until the next followup date. A standard questionnaire with questions about symptoms
of SSI, health-care-seeking behaviors, and treatment received was
administered. Patients reporting symptoms suggestive of post–Csection SSI were encouraged to seek care through their health care
provider. All cases of suspect post–C-section SSI detected during
follow-up calls were carefully reviewed by an infectious disease physician blinded to the study findings. Descriptive statistics and
univariate analyses were performed using Stata version 11.0 (Stata
Corp, College Station, TX). The study was reviewed and approved
by the hospital’s institutional review board.

**RESULTS**

Between April 22 and August 22, 2010, a total number of 193
patients underwent C-section operations at our institution. The mean
age was 28.5 years with 56% percent of the patients being African
American. In addition, more than half of the study population was
considered obese, with a mean body mass index of 33.3. Furthermore, the total number of procedures that were emergent were 62%.
All patients received preoperative antibiotics; 54% received cefazolin
and 26% received penicillin. The hospital length of stay ranged from
2 to 10 days and the mean length of hospital stay was 4 days (see
Table 1).
During the 4-month study period, a total of 956 telephone calls
were made to 177 patients. Five hundred thirty-four calls (56%) were
made between 9 AM and 12 PM, 260 calls (27%) were made between
12 PM and 3 PM, and 162 telephone calls (17%) were made between
3 PM and 6 PM. Between 9 AM and 12 PM 52% of calls were answered, 37.3% were answered between 12 PM and 3 PM, and 37.6%
were answered between 3 PM and 6 PM.
One hundred twenty-six patients (65.3%) were interviewed for
all 3 follow-up times; 11.9% were interviewed twice and only 5.2%
responded to a single call. Seventeen percent of patients did not
answer the telephone or did not provide a working telephone
number.
In general, the minimum duration of follow-up calls was 1 minute
and the maximum time spent on any call was 5 minutes. For the
7-day follow-up telephone call, the mean duration was 2.3 minutes,
for the 14-day follow-up call, it was 1.9 minutes, and for the 30day follow-up, it was 1.7 minutes. It is worth noting that the median

had an SSI after C-section, the mean duration time of the call was
3.2 minutes.
Standard hospital surveillance identified 14 out of 193 (7.2%) patients with SSI, and the telephone calls identified an additional 5
patients (10%) who did not return to Johns Hopkins Hospital for
follow-up care. Using the call as the gold standard, the sensitivity
of the standard methodology to capture SSI was 73.3%. Out of the
total SSI identified, 11 out of 19 (58%) were organ/space, 1 (5.2%)
was deep, and 36% (7 out of 19) were superficial (based on CDC
criteria).[14] Although the standard surveillance underreported SSI by
26% when compared with telephone follow-ups, the chancecorrected agreement (kappa) between the 2 methods was 0.84 (95%
confidence interval, 0.68-0.98), indicating very good agreement: 14
infections were detected by both methods and none of them misidentified any, as was confirmed by the infections diseases physician.

**DISCUSSION**

Infections, including SSI after C-section, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. However, with increasingly short
hospital stays, our findings are in agreement with other studies that
have found that the incidence of SSI is underestimated when a
postdischarge surveillance strategy is not employed.[3,7-9] We found
that an ICP is able to identify discharged patients with an SSI using
a standardized set of questions asked over the telephone and that
doing so takes relatively little time. The average duration of telephone calls that detected suspected post–C-section SSI was 3.2
minutes. The calls included questions about where the patient had
sought care, what the patient had been told by the care provider,
and what treatment the patient had received. It is noteworthy that

believed the hospital cared enough about their condition to contact
them. Moreover, this study made it possible to identify more cases
than what was normally identified through traditional infection prevention surveillance methodology. This was obvious through the rate
detected: 10% by the telephone interview surveillance compared
with the traditional surveillance methodology, which yielded a rate
of 7.3%. Although the 5 patients who developed SSI and were not
detected by chart review comprised only 2.5% of the cohort (5 of
193), these patients represented 26.3% (5 of 19) of all the patients
who developed a post–C-section SSI. In other words, in every 100
C-section procedures there were 2.6 missed cases. Despite the 73%
sensitivity of the traditional surveillance methodology, both methods
had very good degrees of agreement (97%) because they both identified all the negative cases with a specificity of 100%.
In this study, the compliance rate of answering at least a single
telephone call was 82.4% (159 out of 193), 12% (23 out of 193) answered 2 calls, and 56% (126 out of 193) answered 3 calls. Fewer
than 10% of the patients (16 out of 193) did not answer their telephone or had no working telephones. In the literature, a few
published reports directly address the use of telephones to followup with patients.[15-17] However, none of them investigated patients
undergoing C-section. Importantly, the duration of the telephone
calls in our study ranged from a single minute minimum to 5
minutes. Taylor et al[15] reported a maximum call time of 23 minutes.
We found the call time for patients who did not demonstrate signs
or symptoms of SSI was even shorter during the second and third
call (1.9 minutes and 1.7 minutes, respectively). This is because the
latter group of patients had no complaints and they had become
familiar with the questions they were asked during the previous
calls. On the other hand, patients who had developed an SSI had
longer telephone call time with a mean duration call time of 3.2
minutes. It is worth noting that the longest telephone call (5 minutes)
was with a patient who had a low level of English proficiency.
As was stated previously, the calls were not burdensome to patients. In fact, almost all of the patients appeared to welcome the
concept of telephone contact. This result is similar to findings in
other studies that used telephone interviews indicating that telephone interviews can be an optimum study approach in the detection
of post–C-section SSI after discharge.[15-17] Some studies suggest that
postdischarge contact with patients provides them with an opportunity to discuss a potential issue with a provider before it becomes
more serious.[18] In the case of our study, SSIs were identified and
patients were advised to seek medical attention at an early stage.
Consequently, this also allowed the infection preventionists to gather
further data to enhance hospital infection prevention efforts.
It was always assumed that postdischarge surveillance is not easy
to perform; can be expensive; is labor intensive; and requires a dedicated, trained staff member. In contrast, we found that conducting
a telephone interview to do postdischarge surveillance after a
C-section required little time, was feasible, and more importantly
helped in the detection of more cases in comparison to the more
traditional surveillance methodology.
As in any research study, this study has several strength and limitations. A key strength is that patients were called at 3 time intervals,
which enhanced the chances of reaching them. This was clear with
the compliance rate of answering at least a single call that exceeded 80% of the total calls. The main limitation was the patients
who did not answer the telephone or did not have a working telephone number (8.3% of the studied population). Some of those
patients could have had an SSI but were not detected. The small
group of patients who did not answer telephone calls or had nonworking numbers might represent part of the nature of the
socioeconomic status of Baltimore as a city, and reflects another lim

itation of the study. It is possible that these patients did not provide
accurate contact information because of their mistrust of the medical
community or because they do not have the means to sustain a
working telephone. Hence, if a postdischarge surveillance via telephone was applied in a population more accepting of the medical
community, the detection rate might have been even higher. The
final limitation of the study was the small sample size and this was
associated with the duration of the study. If the study was conducted for a longer duration, more cases could have been detected
and of course the conclusion might have been more comprehensive.
We found that postdischarge surveillance is a useful tool in the
identification of potentially preventable harm. Enhanced surveillance can provide more informed data to enhance performance and
avoid the underestimation of post–C-section SSI rates. Moreover,
the use of telephone interviews for improved surveillance was
easy and feasible. Finally, it is important to state that this method
should be used in other populations before it can become more
generalizable.
