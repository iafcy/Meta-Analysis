lower limb fractures related to major trauma and were treated with either incisional negative
pressure wound therapy or standard wound dressing.

**DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized clinical trial conducted at 24 trauma**
hospitals representing the UK Major Trauma Network that included 1548 patients aged 16
years or older who underwent surgery for a lower limb fracture caused by major trauma from
July 7, 2016, through April 17, 2018, with follow-up to December 11, 2018.

**INTERVENTIONS Incisional negative pressure wound therapy (n = 785), which involved a**
specialized dressing used to create negative pressure over the wound, vs standard wound
dressing not involving negative pressure (n = 763).

**MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome measure was deep surgical site**
infection at 30 days diagnosed according to the criteria from the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. A preplanned secondary analysis of the primary outcome was performed
at 90 days. The secondary outcomes were patient-reported disability (Disability Rating Index),
health-related quality of life (EuroQol 5-level EQ-5D), surgical scar assessment (Patient and
Observer Scar Assessment Scale), and chronic pain (Douleur Neuropathique Questionnaire)
at 3 and 6 months, as well as other local wound healing complications at 30 days.

**RESULTS Among 1548 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 49.8 [20.3] years;**
561 [36%] were aged �40 years; 583 [38%] women; and 881 [57%] had multiple injuries),
1519 (98%) had data available for the primary outcome. At 30 days, deep surgical site **Author Affiliations: Oxford Trauma,**

n 2010, trauma was the leading cause of death worldwide
among those younger than 45 years.[1] Major trauma, defined as when more than 1 body system is injured or an iso
# I

lated limb has been subjected to severe trauma, is a significant cause of short- and long-term morbidity and a key cost
driver in both acute health care and subsequent social care.[2]

Eighty-five percent of patients with major trauma sustain serious limb injuries, most commonly fractured bones.[3] Treating these fractures is complicated by the systematic inflammatory response to major trauma, as well as the extensive soft
tissue injuries adjacent to the broken bone which, taken together, may cause high rates of wound infection following
surgery for lower limb fractures after major trauma.[4,5]

One of the factors that may reduce the risk of infection in
the surgical wounds of patients with major trauma is the type
of dressing applied over the incision at the end of the operation. New techniques for wound management, such as incisional negative pressure wound therapy, have shown promisingresultsfollowingsometypesofsurgeryandthesetechniques
havethepotentialforreducingwoundinfections;however,there
islimitedevidenceamongpatientswithwoundsassociatedwith
surgery for lower limb fractures caused by major trauma.[6,7]

The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to determine
if incisional negative pressure wound therapy was more effective than standard wound dressing in reducing the rate of deep
surgical site infection in wounds associated with surgery for a
fracture in the context of major trauma to the lower limb.

### Methods

The National Research Ethics Service approved the study. The

was overseen by independent steering and data and safety
monitoring committees. Eligible patients were approached by
a local researcher and were provided with verbal and written
information about the trial before being asked to provide written informed consent.
Forpatientswithacuteconfusionalstatesortemporaryimpairmentofconsciousness,weapproacheda“consultee”toprovide agreement on behalf of the patient as per the UK Mental
Capacity Act 2005. All participants randomized under this provision were subsequently approached for written consent once
capacity was restored, with the option to continue or discontinue involvement in the trial. For this reason, higher levels of
postrandomizationwithdrawalwereanticipatedthanmightbe
expected in most clinical trials.
Thetrialtookplaceat24majortraumahospitalsrepresenting the UK Major Trauma Network. In the United Kingdom,
patients with major trauma are transported directly to a specialist trauma center. Eligible patients were aged 16 years or
older with a lower extremity fracture caused by major trauma
that required surgery and, postoperatively, had a wound that
could be closed. Patients had to present to the trial hospital
within72hoursoftheirinjury,includingthosewhoweretransferred from other hospitals.


Patientswereexcludediftheywereunabletoadheretothe
trial procedures or complete questionnaires (eg, had a preexistingdiagnosisofdementiaoranopenfractureandthewound
could not be closed after the first surgery). Patients with open
fracturesthatcannotbeclosedatthefirstsurgeryareatthehighest risk of surgical site infection. Incisional negative pressure
wound therapy cannot be applied to these types of wounds.

#### Randomization and Masking
A computer-generated randomization algorithm was created
and delivered by an accredited clinical trials unit to ensure the
allocation sequence was concealed. Each patient was randomized to treatment on a 1:1 basis, stratified by trial recruitment
center, Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 15 or less vs ISS of 16 or
greater (ISS was used as a surrogate for the degree of systemic
inflammatory response associated with the injuries) and open
or closed fracture at presentation (only those open fractures
for which the wound could be closed primarily after the first
surgical wound debridement were eligible for inclusion because incisional negative pressure wound therapy cannot be
applied to wounds that are left open). A probabilistic element
was included in the minimization algorithm to ensure unpredictability of treatment assignment. When a patient entered
the trial, nonidentifiable details were logged on the secure, encrypted, web-based system.
Participantswereassignedtreatmentintraoperativelyatthe
end of surgery once it was determined that the surgical wound
could be closed but before any wound dressing was applied
(Figure). It was not possible to blind trial participants to treatment because the wound dressing was clearly visible. In addition, the treating surgeons could not be blinded to the intervention; however, the surgical and health care teams were not
involvedinanytrialassessmentsandtheprimaryoutcomedata
were collected by independent research associates.

#### Interventions
All patients received a general or regional anesthetic. The operative treatment followed standard clinical practice with relevant details recorded by the research team. At the end of the
operation, a dressing was applied to the surgical wound. The

#### Data Collection and Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure for this study was deep surgical site infection. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines surgical site infection as a “deep infection” involving the tissues deep to the skin that occurs within
30daysofinjury.[10] Thetreatingclinicalteamrecordedanysigns
or symptoms of wound-related infection in the medical record per routine clinical practice. The treating clinicians were
not part of the research team.
The participants were clinically assessed, and the medical records were reviewed by an independent research associate who recorded the primary outcome of deep surgical site
infection against the CDC criteria for the diagnosis of deep infection. The first criterion was whether fluid was leaking from
the wound and whether the fluid was pus. The second criterion included at least one description from each of the following: (1) the wound was gaping open (dehisced) or a surgeon had
deliberately opened the wound and (2) the area around the
wound was painful or tender or the participant had a fever
higher than 38°C. The third criterion was whether there was
any sign of abscess or infection on direct examination or
imaging (eg, ultrasound).
Shortly after the start of this trial, the CDC updated its
criteria for a deep surgical site infection in patients treated for
fracture fixation. Specifically, the end point for wounds involving an implant was changed from 30 days to 90 days. Because
infection at 90 days was captured under the outcome measure
forwoundcomplications,nochangesweremadetodatacollection. However, to facilitate future evidence synthesis, and after
consultationwiththetrialsteeringcommittee,weincludedasecondary analysis of the primary outcome of deep surgical site
infection at 90 days within the statistical analysis plan.

There were several secondary outcomes measured during the 6 months after randomization: (1) patient-reported Disability Rating Index (range, 0 to 100 points [0, normal function; 100, complete disability]; minimal clinically important
difference of 8 points)[11]; (2) health-related quality of life using
theEuroQol5-levelEQ-5D(range,−0.594to1[0,death;ahigher
score relates to better quality of life])[12]; (3) self-reported quality of wound healing using the patient scale from the Patient
and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (range, 1 to 10 [1, normal
skin; 10, very different from normal skin])[13]; and (4) patientreported Douleur Neuropathique Questionnaire for chronic
pain (responses to 7 questions; neuropathic pain considered
present if answered yes to ≥3 questions).[14] Local wound complications other than deep surgical site infection were collected up to 30 days. Resource use data were collected but are

group. In the absence of a commonly accepted minimum clinically important difference for deep wound infection, surgeons in the UK Orthopaedic Trauma Society who perform surgery for major trauma were surveyed to determine what they
believed was a clinically important reduction in deep surgical
site infection rates. The survey (based on 120 respondents)
showed that a 6% reduction in the rate of “deep infection”
would be sufficient to change clinical practice with regard to
the choice of wound dressing.
Assuming a reduction from 15% (based on a prior randomized clinical trial[7]) to 9% in the proportion of patients having
a deep surgical site infection, 615 patients would be required
in each group to provide 90% power at the 5% level. Therefore, we aimed to recruit 1540 participants to account for up
to 20% of patients being lost to follow-up.
Per the prespecified analysis plan, which was approved
by the independent data and safety monitoring committee,
the rates of deep surgical site infection in the 2 groups were
compared using a mixed-effects logistic regression model.
The model included a random effect due to recruitment center, and fixed effects to adjust for open vs closed fractures at
presentation, ISS level (≤15 vs ≥16), participant age, and participant sex. The odds ratio (OR), 95% CI, and associated
_P value were used to compare the 2 treatment groups; the_
absolute risk difference also was reported. This analysis was
performed according to the randomization group (randomized population).
A secondary analysis was performed for the primary outcome measure according to the type of dressing actually
applied (per-protocol population). Binary secondary outcome measures were analyzed using similar logistic regression models. Analogous multilevel, mixed-effects linear
regression models were used for the continuous secondary
outcome measures. The models used repeated measures
nested within participants and were adjusted for fixed and
random effects as in the primary outcome model. The models relied on assumptions of linearity, normality of residuals,
homoscedasticity, and without correlation between level 1
and level 2 residuals; these assumptions were checked via
appropriate plots. All secondary analyses were performed
according to randomization group (randomized population).
The main analyses for the primary and secondary outcomes were performed using available cases only. In a sensitivity analysis, multiple imputation for the missing primary outcome data was performed under the missing at
random assumption.
A 2-sided significance level of .05 was used throughout.
Because of the potential for type I error due to multiple comparisons, the findings for the secondary end point analyses
should be interpreted as exploratory. Stata version 15.0
(StataCorp) was used for all analyses.

### Results

A total of 1629 patients were randomized between July 7,
2016, and April 17, 2018, with follow-up to December 11,
2018. Eighty-one patients did not have sufficient mental


capacity to participate in the study prior to surgery or were
unable or unwilling to provide informed consent after randomization. Among the remaining 1548 participants (mean

[SD] age, 49.8 [20.3] years; 561 [36%] were aged ≤40 years;
583 [38%] women; 964 [62%] men; and 881 [57%] had multiple injuries), 1519 (98%) had data available for the primary
outcome (Figure). Data sum to 1547 for men and women
because we were unable to report sex for 1 person who withdrew immediately after randomization. The majority of participants had a closed fracture (81%) with an ISS of 15 or less
(78%). The characteristics of the 2 groups were well balanced
after randomization (Table 1).
There was no significant difference in the primary outcome measure of deep surgical site infection at 30 days between the groups as randomized. The rate of deep surgical site
infection at 30 days was 5.84% (45/770) in the incisional negative pressure wound therapy group vs 6.68% (50/749) in the
standardwounddressinggroup(OR,0.87[95%CI,0.57to1.33];
absolute risk difference, −0.77% (95% CI, −3.19% to 1.66%);
_P = .52) (Table 2)._
There was no significant difference in the secondary
analysis of the per-protocol population or in the sensitivity
analysis using multiple imputation. In the per-protocol population, the rate of deep surgical site infection at 30 days was
6.14% (41/668) in the incisional negative pressure wound
therapy group vs 6.57% (48/731) in the standard wound
dressing group (OR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.60 to 1.44]; absolute risk
difference, 0.33% [95% CI, −2.93% to 2.15%]; P = .76). In the
randomized population, there was no significant difference
in deep surgical site infection at 90 days; the rate was 11.4%
(72/629) in the incisional negative pressure wound therapy
group vs 13.2% (78/590) in the standard wound dressing
group (OR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.59 to 1.19]; absolute risk difference, −1.76% [95% CI, −5.41% to 1.90%]; P = .32).
Similarly, there was no significant difference between the
groups for the secondary outcome measures. The mean score
for participants’ self-reported Disability Rating Index at 6
months was 40.6 (95% CI, 38.3 to 42.8) in the incisional
negative pressure wound therapy group vs 40.2 (95% CI, 37.7
to 42.8) in the standard wound dressing group (betweengroup mean difference, 0.03 [95% CI, −2.82 to 2.88]; P = .98).
The mean score for health-related quality of life (EuroQol
5-level EQ-5D) at 6 months was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.60) in
the incisional negative pressure wound therapy group vs
0.58 (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.60) in the standard wound dressing
group (between-group mean difference, 0 [95% CI, −0.03 to
0.04]; P = .86).
The mean score for overall self-assessment of the surgical
scar at 30 days was 4.35 (95% CI, 4.15 to 4.56) in the incisional negative pressure wound therapy group vs 4.58 (95%
CI, 4.37 to 4.79) in the standard wound dressing group (mean
between-group difference, −0.18 [95% CI, −0.46 to 0.10];
_P = .22). The proportion of patients reporting chronic neuro-_
pathic pain (Douleur Neuropathique Questionnaire) at 6
months was 28.3% in the incisional negative pressure wound
therapy group vs 31.9% in the standard wound dressing
group (OR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.61 to 1.15]; absolute risk difference, −3.5% [95% CI, −9.9% to 2.8%]; P = .27) (Table 2).

### Discussion

This multicenter trial of patients undergoing surgery for
fractures of the lower limb associated with major trauma
found no significant difference in the rate of deep surgical
site infection at 30 days between patients whose surgical
wound was treated with incisional negative pressure wound
therapy and those treated with standard wound dressing.
There was no significant difference in the rate of deep surgical site infection at 90 days. Furthermore, there was no evidence of any significant differences in patient self-reported
disability, health-related quality of life, scar healing, chronic
pain, or other wound healing complications.

Patientswithopenfracturesofthelowerlimbthatcouldnot
be closed primarily at the first surgical wound debridement
were excluded from this trial. These patients are at the highest
risk of surgical site infection and the use of negative pressure
woundtherapyhaspreviouslybeenreportedintheWoundManagement of Open Lower Limb Fractures (WOLLF) trial.[15] The
WOLLF trial found no evidence that surface negative pressure
wound therapy reduced patient-reported disability for those
with open wounds associated with fractures of the lower limb.
The trial reported herein addresses the use of a different
type of negative pressure wound therapy placed over a closed
surgical incision for wounds that have a high risk for deep
wound infection. At the inception of this trial, there had been
only 1 other trial[7] comparing incisional negative pressure
wound therapy vs standard wound dressing applied to surgical wounds in the context of major trauma. That trial[7] indicated that incisional negative pressure wound therapy reducedtherateofdeepsurgicalsiteinfectionvsstandardwound
dressing. However, the previous study was considerably
smaller (n = 249) than the trial reported herein.
A systematic review of the literature conducted since the
start of this trial shows 1 additional small randomized trial[16]

of incisional negative pressure wound therapy vs standard
wound dressing for surgical wounds following trauma. In that
trial, 66 patients undergoing surgery for fixation of an acetabular fracture were randomized to incisional negative pressure
wound therapy vs standard gauze dressing. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the rate of deep
surgical site infection; however, the number of deep surgical
site infections was small with only 2 patients (6.1%) in the standardwounddressinggroupand5(15.2%)intheincisionalnegative pressure wound therapy group. The only other trial[17] reported since the current trial started, was a mechanistic study
involving 20 patients in which ultrasonography was used to
assess wound seroma formation following the use of incisional negative pressure wound therapy in patients receiving
surgery for spinal fractures.

#### Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, because of the emergency nature of the surgery, it was anticipated that some pa

tients who were randomized would subsequently be unable
or unwilling to participate. However, the majority of patients
(85%) agreed to participate.
Second, 100 patients did not receive the randomized
intervention. As expected, when testing a relatively new
intervention such as incisional negative pressure wound
therapy, the majority of the crossovers were from the incisional negative pressure wound therapy group to the standard wound dressing group (n = 92). The analysis by the
treatment received confirmed the result of the primary
analysis (ie, there was no significant difference between the
groups of participants).
Third, in terms of assessing the primary outcome of infection, the event rate at 30 days was lower than reported in the
literature and lower than anticipated during the trial development. This may reflect recent improvements in the care pathways for patients with major trauma.[18] Or it may simply reflect changes in the way that data relating to deep surgical site
infection are reported. The secondary analysis of the primary
outcome of deep surgical site infection at 90 days, as per the
change in the CDC criteria after the trial started, found an event
rate much closer to that previously reported in the literature
and used in the sample size calculation for this trial. There was
also no significant difference between treatment groups at this
time point.
However, this estimate at 90 days is less precise than that
at 30 days due to higher levels of missing data. In mitigation
of the lower than expected rate of infection at the primary end
point, the rate of those lost to follow-up at 30 days was less
than 2%, which was considerably lower than anticipated.

### Conclusions

Among patients who underwent surgery for major trauma–
related lower limb fractures, use of incisional negative pressure wound therapy, compared with standard wound dressing, resulted in no significant difference in the rate of deep
surgical site infection. The findings do not support the use of
incisional negative pressure wound therapy in this setting, although the event rate at 30 days was lower than expected.
