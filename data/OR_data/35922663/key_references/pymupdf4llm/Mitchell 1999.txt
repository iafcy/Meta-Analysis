**Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate two methods of post-discharge surgical wound surveillance and to compare the**
incidence and outcomes of wound infections that develop prior to patients’ discharge with those that develop after hospital discharge.
**Methods: One thousand, three hundred and sixty inpatients who underwent major elective surgery in an 800-bed teaching hospital in**
western Sydney between February 1996 and July 1997 were followed prospectively. Pre-discharge wound surveillance was performed
by clinical assessment by an independent researcher on the fifth (or later) postoperative day. Post-discharge wound surveillance was
performed by a mail out of questionnaires completed independently by patients and surgeons.
**Results: Overall, 138 wound infections were diagnosed (incidence 10.1%), of which fewer than one-third (n = 44) were diagnosed before**
discharge (average 10.4 days postoperatively) and the remainder (n = 94) after discharge (average 20.6 days postoperatively).
Seven hundred and eighty-two (57.5%) post-discharge survey forms were returned by patients and 680 (50.0%) by surgeons.
When forms were returned by both surgeons and patients for the same wound (641 cases), there was substantial agreement in diagnosing infection or no infection (kappa = 0.73).
**Conclusions: The majority of nosocomial surgical wound infections develop after the patients’ discharge from hospital. A post-discharge**
surveillance programme including self-reporting of infections by patients and return of questionnaires by patients and surgeons is feasible
in an Australian hospital setting. However, such a programme is labour and resource intensive and strategies to increase return of
questionnaires are required.

**Key words: infection control, nosocomial wound infection, surgical wound infection.**


**INTRODUCTION**

Post-surgical wound infections are a major cause of increased
nosocomial morbidity and mortality and excess healthcare costs.
There are few published Australian data, but the Australian Nosocomial Infection Prevalence Survey published in 1984 showed
that surgical wound infections accounted for 34% of nosocomial
infections with an estimated excess annual cost of $60 million
Australia wide.[1]
Surveillance is the core component of any wound infection
control programme. Comprehensive surgical wound surveillance, with reporting of infection rates to and action by individual
surgeons and hospital managers, can result in sustained reductions
in infection rates over time.[2] The educational aspects of surveillance
also reinforce the importance of wound infections and the need for
continuous maintenance of high standards of surgical care.
Despite the decision of the Australian Council on Healthcare
Standards (ACHS) to include clean and contaminated surgical
wound infection rates as clinical indicators for hospital accreditation,[3] it does not define a standardized method for performing
surgical wound infection surveillance for use by Australian hospitals.[4] In addition, the limited surveillance that is currently
being performed by Australian hospitals is usually confined to
detection of infections which are diagnosed prior to the patient’s

discharge from hospital. The published literature, however, suggests that a significant proportion of surgical wound infection
(10–80% in various studies) does not develop until after patients’
discharge from hospital.[5] This proportion is likely to increase as the
introduction of case-mix funding and an emphasis on the reduction
of waiting lists encourage earlier discharge. There is no standardized
method for conducting post-discharge surveillance.
The aims of this study were: (i) to evaluate post-discharge
surgical wound surveillance methods using mailed out questionnaires completed independently by patients and surgeons; and
(ii) to compare the incidence and outcomes of wound infection that
develops prior to patients’ discharge with those developing after
hospital discharge.

**METHODS**

**Location**

Westmead Hospital is an 800-bed teaching hospital in western
Sydney that performs about 200 major surgical procedures per
week of which approximately half are classified as ‘clean’ procedures.

**Wound surveillance**

From February 1996, a research nurse collected data on operations
chosen to represent the major elective procedures performed by
cardiothoracic, vascular, abdominal, orthopaedic and gynaecological surgeons at the hospital. They included clean and ‘contaminated’ procedures for which the expected postoperative stay
exceeded 5 days, reflecting ACHS requirements current at the
time.[3] Clean procedures were defined as procedures in which a

and contaminated procedures were those in which such organs
had been entered. Patients were examined by the research nurse
on day 5 or later postoperatively and the status of their surgical
wound(s) was determined. Infection was diagnosed and classified
on the basis of clinical criteria modified (in order to simplify
self-assessment by patients) from those of the Centers for
Disease Control.[6] Infection was diagnosed if purulent drainage was
present or obtained from the wound. Infection was classified as
superficial incisional if it involved only skin or subcutaneous
tissue and as deep incisional if it also involved deep soft tissues
(fascial and muscle layers). Demographic, American Society of
Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class,[7] wound status and outcome data
were collected for each patient and entered into an MS-ACCESS v 2.0
database (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA, USA). Reports that
detailed infection rates and other information (such as use of
prophylactic antibiotics) were produced monthly and reviewed
by relevant surgical, infection control and quality assurance staff.
At the time of assessment in hospital, each patient was given a
mailback form and asked to complete a simple questionnaire
about their wound and medical follow up and return it after day 28
of their operation. Surgeons also received a separate mailback
form that requested information on the wound status of each
patient obtained at their postoperative review. If any of the
returned forms indicated a possible wound infection, the patient and
the surgeon were contacted by the research nurse to confirm the
diagnosis and obtain details.
The study proposal was approved by the Western Sydney
Area Health Service Bioethics Consultative Committee and performed with the full support and cooperation of members of the
Division of Surgery. The study was funded by the Westmead
Hospital Charitable Trust.

**Statistical analysis**

Statistical analysis was assisted by using the computer program

STATA v 5.0 (Stata Corporation, Texas USA). Characteristics of
those with no infection, pre-discharge wound infection and postdischarge wound infection and outcomes for those with wound
infection were compared using Fisher’s exact test. A significance level of less than 0.05 was used. The kappa statistic was used
to assess agreement between surgeons and patients in diagnosing
infections developing out of hospital. A kappa value of greater than
0.60 was considered to indicate substantial agreement.[8]

From February 1996 to July 1997 inclusive, 1360 patients were

post-discharge survey. The mean age of patients was 63.3 years and
53.2% were male. Their distribution into ASA Classes[7] reflected
the significant proportion with underlying disease in this population: Class 1, 8.7%; Class 2, 21.9%; Class 3, 54.7%; Class 4,
14.7% (where Class 1 indicates the highest, and Class 4, the
lowest, level of fitness). The operations performed and compliance
with return of forms are summarized in Table 1. Seven hundred and
eighty-two patient survey forms and 680 surgeon survey forms
were returned, giving an overall compliance for return of forms of
57.5% and 50.0% by patients and surgeons, respectively.

**Agreement between patients and surgeons**

Forms that related to 641 wounds were returned by both patients
and surgeons. Both patients and surgeons agreed that wound infection
was present in 51 and absent in 565 cases (kappa = 0.73). In eight
cases, infection was diagnosed by the surgeon, but not by the
patient and in 25 cases by the patient but not by the surgeon.
Review of the latter 25 cases confirmed that infection had occurred in
23 patients, who had either presented to a doctor other than their
surgeon or had developed infection after review by the surgeon.
Cases in which either patients or surgeons, but not both, returned
forms (141 and 39 cases, respectively) were also analysed. Four
additional cases of wound infection were diagnosed by surgeons
and 11 were diagnosed by patients. In these latter 11 cases, eight
were confirmed as true infections after review.

**Incidence of pre- and post-discharge wound infections**

During the 18-month period, 44 (31.9%) of 138 infected wounds
were detected prior to the patients’ discharge from hospital and 94
(68.1%) after discharge. Rates of wound infection are compared for

commonly diagnosed pre-discharge following orthopaedic procedures, unlike the situation with other clean procedures. The
reason for this is not clear but it did not reflect a difference in hospital stay between orthopaedics and other specialities (data not
shown). Pre-discharge infection rates were not significantly different between contaminated and clean procedures (4.4% and
3.0%, respectively; P = 0.29, Fisher’s exact test), but post-discharge
infections occurred significantly more frequently after clean
procedures (7.5% vs 3.4%; P = 0.01, Fisher’s exact test).

**Time of diagnosis and degree of wound infection and**
**patient outcome**

Ninety-seven per cent of infections were diagnosed within 28
days of operation. Comparison of outcome variables for patients
with infections are shown in Table 3. Patients who developed
their infection in hospital were significantly more likely to have
‘deep incisional’ infection than those who developed infection
after discharge (63.6% vs 19.1%; P < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test).
Two of the six deaths in the pre-discharge infection group were
directly related to the wound infection.

**Peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis**

Patients who underwent cardiac, orthopaedic, vascular and
abdominal surgery received peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis routinely. Ninety-three (44.1%) of the women who underwent abdominal hysterectomy received antibiotic prophylaxis.
Of these, five (5.4%) developed wound infection, compared
with 16 (13.6%) of 118 women who did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis (P = 0.06, Fisher’s exact test)

**DISCUSSION**

This study demonstrates both the importance and the difficulty of performing surveillance for surgical wound infections that develop
after hospital discharge. Nearly 70% of the infections detected in this
study developed after the patient’s discharge from hospital. This is
consistent with other published studies,[5] which have shown that
10–80% of surgical wound infections develop post-discharge and as
in the present study, are largely unrecognized by hospital personnel.
While patients with more severe infections may present as unplanned re-admissions, the majority will be managed by healthcare
workers in the community and the community, not the hospital,
bears the cost. Unless surgical wound surveillance includes a
post-discharge component, infection rates, morbidity and costs
will be grossly underestimated. The current surveillance guidelines of the ACHS do not recommend or require that postdischarge data be collected[3,4] and it has been suggested that this


Even if the need for post-discharge surveillance is acknowledged,
the methodology is problematic. Methods used in published
studies have included examination of patients in follow-up
clinics or surgeons’ private rooms; surveillance of re-admissions
to hospital because of surgical wound infection; review of the
medical records of surgical patients after a period in which most
infections would be expected to have developed; postal and/or telephone follow up of surgeons; postal and/or telephone follow up
of patients;[10,11] review of patients in their homes.[12] Often postdischarge data have been collected from several sources.[13] All
of these methods are labour intensive and costly to implement.
Each hospital needs to individualize its methodology as the
pattern of patient follow up will vary for each institution. Surveillance should continue for at least 28 days postoperatively as
approximately 95% of infections (97% in the present study)
develop within this period.[14]
This study used a combination of simple questionnaires
returned by both patients and surgeons to detect post-discharge
infections. A major limitation of this approach as demonstrated in
this study is the relatively poor compliance with return of forms
(57% by patients and 50% by surgeons). Such compliance rates
are, however, consistent with those of other published studies.[10]
Compliance by surgeons could possibly be improved by sending
them a form each month listing each patient operated on in the previous month and a tick box to determine wound status, rather
than a separate questionnaire to return on each patient. Compliance
by both patients and surgeons may also be improved by telephoning non-responders or sending a reminder form after 28 days,
although this is considerably more labour intensive and time
consuming.[13,15]
There are conflicting conclusions in the literature about the
ability of patients to diagnose their own wound infections. In one
study of sutured traumatic wounds in an emergency department,[16] the
positive predictive value of a patient’s diagnosis of wound infection
was only 26% compared with that of medical staff. The authors concluded that patient-reported data were too unreliable to be of use. In
the present study, many of the infections reported by patients had
been diagnosed by the patient’s surgeon or general practitioner
rather than by the patient alone. Of more relevance is a postdischarge study of 5042 surgical wounds performed by a Boston
hospital.[17] In this study the positive predictive value of patientreported infections was greater than that of surgeon-reported
infections (but only 36% vs 27%) because of the greater compliance
of patients compared to surgeons in returning questionnaires. The
use of patient-reported surveillance to diagnose an adverse outcome of hospital treatment raises ethical and medico-legal issues but
in practice most patients apparently welcome the opportunity to
be involved in their medical care.

following procedures classified as clean compared with those
classified as contaminated. This reflects the relatively large
number of post-discharge infections in the predominately clean procedures performed by cardiac surgeons and gynaecologists. The
longer incubation period may reflect the lower inoculum of bacteria
contaminating the incision at the time of a clean procedure (as
compared with a contaminated procedure).[13]
As would be expected, significantly more severe infections
(i.e. those classified as ‘deep incisional’) presented early and
before discharge, and a quarter of infected patients required reoperation and with a significant associated mortality. While
infections that develop after hospital discharge tend to be less
severe, there is still a significant cost in terms of the utilization of
community health services, lost employment time etc. These
costs are largely borne by the community rather than the hospital.
The important role of prophylactic peri-operative antibiotics in
reducing the risk of wound infection is well established for many
surgical procedures. While recommended routinely for vaginal
hysterectomy, the use of prophylactic antibiotics in abdominal
hysterectomy has been controversial.[18] Recent studies, however,
have demonstrated a significant cost-effective reduction in infection
rates following abdominal hysterectomy when a single injection of
an early generation cephalosporin is given at the induction of
anaesthesia.[18,19] Our data also show a trend for a protective effect
of antibiotic prophylaxis for this procedure.
The majority of nosocomial post-surgical wound infections do
not develop until after hospital discharge; a problem which is
under-recognized in Australia. This places a significant burden
on community health services. A comprehensive wound surveillance programme, including a post-discharge surveillance component, is the first step in reducing the incidence of wound
infections. This study shows that a post-discharge surveillance
programme including self-reporting of infections by patients
and return of questionnaires by patients and surgeons is feasible in
an Australian hospital setting. Such a programme is, however,
labour and resource intensive and poor compliance in the return of
questionnaires was found to be a major limitation.
