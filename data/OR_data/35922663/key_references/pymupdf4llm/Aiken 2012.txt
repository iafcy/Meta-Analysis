Background: In low-income countries, surgical site infections (SSIs) are a very frequent
form of hospital-acquired infection. Surveillance is an important method for controlling SSI
but it is unclear how this can best be performed in low-income settings.
Aim: To examine the epidemiological characteristics of various components of an SSI
surveillance programme in a single Kenyan hospital.
Methods: The study assessed the inter-observer consistency of the surgical wound class
(SWC) and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores using the kappa statistic.
Post-discharge telephone calls were evaluated against an outpatient clinician review ‘gold
standard’. The predictive value of components of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention e National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC-NHNS) risk index was examined in
patients having major obstetric or gynaecological surgery (O&G) between August 2010 and
February 2011.
Findings: After appropriate training, surgeons and anaesthetists were found to be
consistent in their use of the SWC and ASA scores respectively. Telephone calls were found
to have a sensitivity of 70% [95% confidence interval (CI): 47e87] and a specificity of 100%
(95% CI: 95e100) for detection of post-discharge SSI in this setting. In 954 patients
undergoing major O&G operations, the SWC score was the only parameter in the CDC-NHNS
risk index model associated with the risk of SSI (odds ratio: 4.00; 95% CI: 1.21e13.2;
P ¼ 0.02).
Conclusions: Surveillance for SSI can be conducted in a low-income hospital setting,
although dedicated staff, intensive training and local modifications to surveillance
methods are necessary. Surveillance for post-discharge SSI using telephone calls is
imperfect but provides a practical alternative to clinic-based diagnosis. The SWC score
was the only predictor of SSI risk in O&G surgery in this context.

### Introduction

A World Health Organization (WHO) systematic review in
2011 on hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) highlighted the
scarcity of studies from low-income countries and from African
countries in particular.[1] From limited information, surgical site
infections (SSIs) were identified as a significant problem: the
risk in developing countries was ‘strikingly higher than in
equivalent surgical procedures in high income countries’.
Conducting surveillance for SSIs is recognized as making an
important contribution to reducing the risk of these infections.
Establishing high-quality surveillance with timely feedback to
surgeons can lead to reduction in risk of SSI.[2] A systematic
review of interventions for preventing SSI in sub-Saharan Africa
found no examples of surveillance being conducted with the
primary purpose of reducing the risk of SSI.[3]

The SENIC project (Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial
Infection Control) had demonstrated that the critical components of SSI surveillance were: (i) accurate collection and
reporting of information; (ii) appropriate stratification of risk.[4]

For the first component, methods for accurate collection of
information for SSI surveillance have been extensively
researched in high-income countries.[5,6] However, these
methods are not applicable in hospitals in low-income settings
where data extraction from inpatient records is challenging
and electronic linkage to primary healthcare records is
impossible. In all settings, many SSI cases occur after discharge
from hospital.[6] Incorporating these cases into surveillance
systems is especially problematic in low-income settings,
where surgical patients are often dispersed over a wide area.
For the second component of SSI surveillance, an appropriate system of risk stratification is needed to make comparisons of the risk of SSI between centres or over time. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention e National
Healthcare Safety Network (CDC-NHSN) risk index provides one
such system. A score of 0e3 is assigned based on the sum of
values derived from the American Society of Anesthesiologists
physical status classification (ASA) score, the surgical wound
class (SWC) and operation duration in relation to a procedurespecific length (time T).[7] Although these components of the
risk index are, in principle, readily transferable to low-income
settings, an important question is whether accuracy of scoring
in routine clinical practice in such settings is adequate to
reliably predict risk of SSI.
The aim was to evaluate epidemiological characteristics of
various components of SSI surveillance in a low-income hospital
setting in sub-Saharan Africa. We evaluated: the inter-observer
consistency of SWC and ASA scoring; the sensitivity and specificity of telephone calls for identifying SSI against a clinician
review ‘gold standard’; the association of CDC-NHSN risk index
components with the risk of SSI in this setting.

### Methods

Thika Level 5 Hospital is a 300-bed government hospital in
the town of Thika, about 50 km north east of Nairobi, in Central
Province of Kenya. At Thika Hospital there are six consultant
surgeons and a rotating pool of 16e20 medical officers (junior
doctors) and clinical officers (vocationally trained clinicians)
who carry out a range of elective and emergency surgical
procedures. There are four operating theatres and about 300


major and minor operations take place monthly. Caesarean
sections are the most commonly performed procedure. Surgical
instruments are reprocessed in a steam autoclave with monitoring by a change in colour of sealant tape. Prior to February
2011, antibiotic prophylaxis was normally administered to
patients postoperatively, as is standard practice in many
government hospitals in the region. Thika Hospital is not
a university hospital, nor does it have an extensive history of
research collaborations. It is a typical mid-sized Kenyan
government hospital.
As a collaborative project between the Ministry of Medical
Services, the Kenya Medical Research Institute and Thika
Hospital, SSI surveillance was conducted at Thika Hospital for
a continuous period from August 2010 to December 2011.
All patients gave written consent to participation in
surveillance, which included contact by phone after discharge
from hospital. This study was approved by the KEMRI National
Ethical Review Committee.
Postoperative patient reviews, data and sample collection,
phone calls and data entry were performed daily by a team of
hospital staff members (two clinical officers and four support
staff). All data for CDC-NHNS risk index criteria were recorded
by hospital surgeons and anaesthetists. We diagnosed SSI in
accordance with CDC-NHSN definitions as far as possible given
the diagnostic facilities available.[8] Microbiological criteria
were not used for SSI diagnosis, although microbiology services
at Thika Hospital were upgraded as part of the surveillance. All
diagnoses of SSI were discussed with the relevant surgical team
and an infectious diseases physician. Feedback of ongoing
surveillance results was given in writing and discussed in
a series of multidisciplinary seminars.
In our surveillance, we included all surgical operations
where a surgical wound was created during the procedure and
the patient stayed overnight in hospital. We therefore
excluded patients having day-case surgery (including all ear/
nose/throat, ophthalmic and minor gynaecological procedures)
and debridement of traumatic or infected wounds. During their
inpatient stay, postoperative patients were reviewed at every
dressing change, normally starting on the third postoperative
day and on alternate days thereafter. Patients remained in SSI
surveillance for 30 days after all eligible surgical operations,
including both inpatient and outpatient periods. Postoperative
readmissions to Thika Hospital were actively sought daily. After
discharge, telephone-based surveillance was conducted as
described below. Patients were encouraged to contact the
surveillance team if they received treatment for wound
complications at another facility.
All information for SSI surveillance was recorded in
a custom-made PHP-MySQL database. Statistical analyses were
performed using Stata v12 software (Stata Corp., College
Station, TX, USA).

#### Consistency of SWC and ASA scores

Scoring consistency tests were conducted with the Surgery,
Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) and Anaesthetics departments in Thika Hospital. In each department, a series of 10 case
histories was developed describing patient scenarios similar to
those encountered in local practice. After revision of the
relevant scoring system, all departmental members independently scored the SWC or ASA for these case histories. These
results were presented to each department and the need to


-----

ensure inter-observer consistency was explained. Various
different approaches to improving consistency were employed:
departmental discussions, educational meetings and written
guidelines and posters in departments. Among surgeons,
a second round of this exercise was conducted with actual
patients; in the O&G and Anaesthetics departments, a second
round of this exercise used different paper-based case
histories.
As the scoring depended on making a clinical judgement, no
answer was considered ‘correct’: the kappa statistic (k) was
employed to assess inter-observer consistency. A weighted k
was used to account for the ordered nature of the scoring
categories.

#### Sensitivity and specificity of telephone-based surveillance

At discharge, patients (or their guardians) were asked to
give a mobile phone number where they could be contacted
during the next 30 days. More than 90% of patients provided
this. Patients were contacted twice by mobile phone on
approximately the 14th and 28th postoperative days to inquire
about wound complications since discharge. Surveillance staff
asked a standard series of questions regarding current condition of the wound, and distinguished between presence of
(normal) postoperative mild pain, itching and serous ooze and
(abnormal) severe pain, wound breakdown and purulent
discharge. Patients could also contact the SSI surveillance team
by phone. Patients reporting current symptoms consistent with
wound infection were asked to re-attend Thika Hospital for
free outpatient review.
Using clinician review in the outpatient clinic as the diagnostic gold standard, paired observations of telephone interview and direct clinician review were analysed when these
were performed within 48 h of each other to determine the
sensitivity and specificity of telephone calls as a diagnostic
test. It was assumed that ‘wound infection status’ could not
change within a 48 h period.

#### Performance of CDC-NHSN risk index

To analyse the predictive performance of the CDC-NHNS risk
index, all forms of SSI were re-categorized (including those
occurring after discharge) into a single outcome variable.
Exposure variable data were extracted from medical notes at
the time of the operation. Logistic regression was used to
analyse risk index components in a group consisting of
caesarean sections and major gynaecological operations

conducted between August 2010 and February 2011. Time T
represented 1 h for all of these procedures. We did not include
other procedures in this modelling as the risk index is only
intended to be applied to groups of similar procedures e there
were insufficient numbers of any other operative group for
adequate evaluation.

### Results

Following extensive development, training and piloting, SSI
surveillance was conducted at Thika Hospital for a 16-month
continuous period from August 2010 to December 2011). All
consecutive adult and paediatric patients undergoing eligible
operative procedures were enrolled.

#### Consistency of SWC and ASA scores

Consistency studies were conducted for the SWC and ASA
score as shown in Table I. Junior staff rotated between
departments every three months, so this exercise could not be
repeated in the surgical departments at intervals longer than
this. The second exercise was performed in the Anaesthetics
department after a 13-month interval.
Whereas consistency of scoring between clinicians initially
ranged from fair (within the O&G department) to excellent
(within the Surgery department), after a period of routine use
of these scoring systems, the consistency between clinicians
improved in all departments. The high degree of consistency
achieved in the Surgery department in a ‘paper-based’ exercise
(k ¼ 0.81) was replicated when the same approach was applied
with actual patients (k ¼ 0.83, based on 55 paired observations). Subsequently, continuous training of incoming staff was
used to maintain these high levels of consistency.

#### Validity of telephone-based surveillance

There were a total of 89 pairs of outpatient clinician reviews
and telephone interviews within 48 h of each other. For 23
patients diagnosed in outpatients by a clinician as having SSI,
16 of these had been judged to have SSI in their telephone
interview. For 66 patients seen in outpatients by a clinician and
considered not to have SSI, none of these had been considered
to have SSI in their telephone interview. On the basis of these
results, the sensitivity of telephone calls was 69.6% [95%
confidence interval (CI): 47.1e86.8%] and the specificity was
100% (95% CI: 95e100%).

#### Description of surveillance operations and performance of CDC-NHSN risk index

Between August 2010 and February 2011, a total of 1172
operations conducted at Thika Hospital were followed up in SSI
surveillance. The characteristics of these operations are given
in Table II. As caesarean sections predominated among these
procedures (75% of operations), surveillance mainly included
women of child-bearing age. A wide variety of other operations
were also included in surveillance including laparotomies,
hysterectomies, hernia repairs, appendicectomies and amputations. There was a high risk of SSI in orthopaedics and
neurosurgery (14%), reflecting the high incidence of extensively contaminated road-accident trauma in this hospital.
Surgery performed by clinical officers (vocationally trained
clinicians) did appear to have elevated risk of SSI (15%)
although this is based on a very small number of procedures.
Antibiotic prophylaxis was normally delivered as a postoperative regime, as is widely used in hospitals in Kenya. We
have not calculated an overall risk of SSI in the surveillance

infections) in caesarean sections and major gynaecological

### Discussion

There are very few previous reports that have studied SSI
surveillance methods in sub-Saharan Africa, and we are
unaware of any that have examined either the consistency of
scoring of risk index components or the characteristics of
telephone calls as a surveillance method for SSI.[9,10] This study
represents the largest SSI surveillance cohort reported in subSaharan Africa.
After appropriate training and with ongoing feedback,
surgeons and anaesthetists in Thika Hospital were consistent in
categorization of SWC and ASA scores in paper-based evaluations. This consistency improved over time and was similar
when applied to actual patients. On this basis, the scoring of
these indices by clinicians in this setting can achieve an
adequate consistency to make them suitable for use as SSI risk
stratification variables.
The sensitivity and specificity of telephone calls as a postdischarge follow-up tool for SSI surveillance were 70% and
100% respectively. Although this was based on a relatively small
number of paired observations, the analysis was restricted to
those observations within 48 h of each other to maximize
accuracy. Specificity was high as there were no false-positive
telephone-based diagnoses (type 1 errors) among our paired
observations. The moderate sensitivity obtained means that
some genuine SSI cases may have been missed (type 2 errors) in
surveillance. This combination of high specificity and moderate
sensitivity are satisfactory characteristics for a ‘stand-alone’
test where the outcome is rare. During the pilot phase of
surveillance, we had found that in Thika Hospital the actual
attendance at postoperative outpatient appointments was
extremely poor (<25%). Researchers in Tanzania had also found
poor attendance (54%) at postoperative follow-up appointments.[9] Telephone calls have also been used for post-discharge
SSI detection in a cluster-randomized trial of a surgical handwashing intervention in Kenya, although that study did not
examine the sensitivity or specificity of the method.[11] Telephone calls appear to be a reasonable method of detecting
post-discharge SSI in this setting, although this should be
further evaluated as a diagnostic tool.[12] This method may be
population-specific as Kenya has very high penetration of
mobile phone services.
Surgical wound class was predictive of risk of SSI in the
univariate and multivariate models in major O&G operations.
This is consistent with studies from Tanzania and Ethiopia and
with findings from elsewhere in the world, where SWC remains
a cornerstone of SSI risk stratification.[1,8,10,13]

Few studies in Africa have examined the use of the ASA score
as a predictor of SSI risk. The ASA score approximates ‘global’

patient health at the time of the operation, and is a reliable
predictor of the risk of SSI in high-income settings.[14] However,
it provided no useful predictive information in this setting
when applied to major O&G operations. This may be because
these procedures were mainly performed on healthy young
women among whom higher scores were rarely assigned, which
may limit the utility of the ASA score as a discriminator of risk.
In other African studies, the ASA score was strongly predictive
of risk in a mixture of obstetric and general surgical procedures
in Tanzania but only weakly predictive of risk in a study of
paediatric surgery in Nigeria.[10,15]

The duration of an operation gives an indication of the
complexity of performing that specific procedure. When this is
compared to a standard length, this can predict the risk of
subsequent complications. Operation duration was predictive
of SSI risk in several studies in low-income settings, though
using ‘local’ values for standard operation length was found to
improve the predictive power.[9,10,16,17] The duration of surgery
in this study was not associated with the risk of SSI in major
O&G operations.
There are limitations to our study. Both the evaluation of
the consistency of SWC and ASA scores and the sensitivity and
specificity of telephone calls are based on relatively small
numbers of observations. However, these are the most detailed
examinations of these topics in the region to date. The evaluation of the CDC-NHNS risk index in O&G surgery is the largest
such group ever reported in sub-Saharan Africa.


Six full-time staff with salaries equivalent to entry-level
nurses were required to conduct this surveillance. About 250
procedures were followed up each month. The high cost of
supporting these staff meant that surveillance could not be
sustained beyond the duration of this collaborative project.
Commercially available software for SSI surveillance might
have been a cheaper alternative to our bespoke, locally programmed database.
The value of surveillance is providing surgeons with
comparative data about their specific performance. Combining
many different types of procedure with different intrinsic risks
of infection is therefore of no real value. In the smaller
throughput types of surgery, it would be necessary to collect
surveillance data for much longer periods or across many sites
in order to adequately evaluate the risks of SSI.
In conclusion, surveillance is an important method of
measuring and controlling SSIs, which are recognized to
be a significant form of HAI in sub-Saharan Africa. In a lowincome hospital setting it was found that surgeons and
anaesthetists can assign consistent scores for the SWC and
ASA; ongoing training and feedback are required. Telephone
calls appear to be a reasonable method of detecting postdischarge SSI cases, although further evaluation is needed.
Of the components of the CDC-NHNS risk index, only the
SWC provided useful predictive information on the risk of SSI
in our hospital, where caesarean sections represent the bulk
of operations.
