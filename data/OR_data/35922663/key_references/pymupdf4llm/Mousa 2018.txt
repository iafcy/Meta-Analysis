45 **Abstract:**

46 **INTRODUCTION: Post-surgical discharge complications result in increased hospital**

47 readmissions, cost, and patient dissatisfaction. Telehealth technology to monitor patients,


48 especially those in geographically isolated areas, may reduce post-operative complications,

49 improve health and financial outcomes.

50 **OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to compare outcomes between patients that received**

51 **Telehealth electronic monitoring (THEM) to those with routine discharge instructions and no**

52 monitoring, Standard Of Care (SOC).

53 **METHODS: This was a prospective randomized study of vascular surgery patients with infra-**

54 inguinal incisions. THEM patients received a tablet and home monitoring devices that

55 transmitted information to care managers. Monitoring tools included image capture, weight

56 scales, blood pressure cuffs, thermometers and oxygen saturation monitors. Care managers used

57 the TeleMed 2020 Enform™ platform to review alerts, real-time patient data, and dialogue with

58 the care team.

59 **RESULTS: Eighty** patients were screened and thirty enrolled, of which 16 (53.3%) were

60 randomized to the THEM and 14 (46.7%) control groups. Average age and BMI for THEM and

61 control patients were similar (62.5 + 7.2 vs 65.7 + 7.3, p=0.234; and 27.7 + 4.3 vs 29.1 7.1,

62 p=0.487), respectively. There was a similar number of male participants in each group (THEM

63 62.5% versus SOC 42.9%, p=0.464). There were no significant differences in wound or 30-day

64 readmissions (THEM 6.3% vs SOC 7.1%, p=1.000). Interestingly, 30-day infection rates

65 indicated care managers identified marginally more superficial wound problems in the THEM

66 group (31.3% vs 7.1%, p=0.175). Both groups reported an increase in SF8 physical summary

67 scores, but was more pronounced in THEM patients (p=0.076). THEM patients reported a

68 significantly greater improvement in quality of life on three of the SF8 quality subscales

69 (Physical function, Role-Physical and Role-Emotional; THEM ∆ 7.5 vs Control ∆ 1.1; THEM ∆

70 8.7 vs Control ∆ 1.1; and THEM ∆ 6.3 Control ∆ -0.5; all p<0.05). THEM patients reported


71 trends for higher satisfaction in terms of general satisfaction, technical quality and accessibility

72 for PSQ18 survey questions (4.2 vs 3.7,p=0.072; 4.5 vs 4.1, p=0.081; and 4.2 vs 3.8, p=0.063),

73 respectively.

74 **Conclusion: THEM was technically feasible and provided some benefit to patients in**

75 geographically disparate areas. THEM was associated with increased patient satisfaction.

76 Additional findings suggested THEM patients embraced telehealth technology and took

77 advantage of increased access to health care professionals. Telehealth successfully merged

78 remotely generated information with care manager interaction. Presently, a larger study,

79 preferably multicenter, is warranted and under consideration.

92 **Introduction:**


93 Modern telehealth utilization has evolved from using the telephone in the 1870’s to reduce

94 unnecessary office visits to using tablets or other devices to transmit voice, survey questions,

95 email or text messages, images, and videos with or without conferencing.[1-3] Telehealth

96 continues to progress and has grown into a larger domain in patient care that combines both

97 telecommunications and information technologies. This digital approach has the potential to

98 provide continuous remote medical care access to different aspects of patient care from different

99 geographical locations for extended periods of time. The scope of telehealth communication

100 may range from simple activities such as telephone consultation to more sophisticated

101 technology as tele- or robotic surgery.[2] Feasibility of these approaches has been previously

102 evaluated.[3-6] In one study, it was determined that there were no diagnostic errors made using

103 remote telemedicine compared to in-person clinic follow-up. [7] Ironically, vascular

104 interventionists, although currently practicing in highly technologically-laden environments,

105 have limited use of modern telehealth approaches. Most large care centers and specialty

106 physicians are located in metropolitan areas requiring patients to travel significant distances for

107 simple office visits. Further, for a myriad of reasons, areas of the country remain relatively

108 geographically isolated. Telehealth Electronic Monitoring (THEM) has emerged as a valid

109 option to access and monitor patients within different levels of their healthcare. Telehealth is a

110 vector that allows the transfer of information from the patient to the provider or vice versa.

111 Indeed, THEM technology can decrease the burden placed on medical resources, increase the

112 efficacy of health care and increase the time efficiency for both patients and physicians. Yet, a

113 more comprehensive approach that includes patient satisfaction surveys and bio-sensors is

114 needed to better define the utilization and role of telehealth for surgical and other vascular

115 interventions. The current prospective randomized controlled study was designed to evaluate

116 clinical outcomes, utilization, feasibility, patient satisfaction and quality of life for patients using

117 THEM after cut-down infra-inguinal incision (i.e., dissection of a vein or artery for insertion of a


118 cannula or needle) for any vascular procedure.

119

120 **Methods:**

121

122 The specific details of the current study design have previously been reported. [8] Briefly, it was a

123 **prospective, randomized, open-label, single-center with blinded endpoints (PROBE) designed**

124 study.[9] The primary objective of the current project was to compare outcomes for patients who

125 received post discharge health care monitoring (which includes using Telehealth electronic

126 **monitoring; THEM) to patients who receive standard of care (SOC), which included routine**

127 discharge instructions with no telehealth monitoring. The primary outcomes included 30-day

128 readmissions and deep surgical site infections. Secondary outcomes included pre and post
129 surgery quality of life measures (SF-8), patient satisfaction, superficial surgical site infection, in
130 home visits from visiting nurse service (VNS), and an occurrence of any 30-day stroke,

131 myocardial infarction or death. The study had three main hypotheses: 1) A smaller percentage of

132 THEM patients would require a 30-day unplanned readmission compared to patients who

133 received standard of care (SOC). 2) A smaller percentage of THEM patients would develop

134 deep SSIs (i.e., infections involving fascia and/or muscular layers requiring wound interventions

135 such as opening, debridement, etc.) compared to SOC. 3) THEM patients would report greater

136 post discharge satisfaction and higher quality of life measures than SOC patients.

138 Patients in the intervention group (THEM) received a tablet computer with the Enform[®] App and

139 set of medical devices for home monitoring. Medical devices included weight scales, blood

140 pressure cuffs, thermometer and oxygen saturation monitors. Each participant randomized to the


141 THEM arm was provided a take-home kit. The kit contained (Samsung Galaxy Tab E 8” inch

142 tablets with Supcase/Finitie rigid cases, Prooral professional digital thermometer, A&D UC
143 352 BLE weight scales, TaiDoc TD-3250-C blood pressure monitor, ChoiceMMed

144 MD300C318T2 oxygen saturation device). (Figure 1) Data from these Bluetooth enabled

145 devices along with routine wellness assessment question responses were securely transmitted and

146 reviewed by care managers using the web enabled Enform[®] clinician portal. Clinical care

147 managers were both registered nurses with over 30 years of experience. Each had experience

148 in ambulatory cardiovascular nursing, and remotely monitored the patients using this tool

149 daily. Clinical care managers engaged with patients by phone or used the integrated Enform[®]

150 messaging based on alerts and/or data generated by the telehealth monitoring system.

151 Participants were instructed to monitor the tablets daily, perform their measurements (i.e., blood

152 pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, weight and temperature) and answer daily plus weekly

153 quiz questions. (Table 1) The care manager logged into the TeleMed2020 website and

154 monitored values daily, however, the care manager only initiated contact with participants by

155 phone or internal messaging if there was a concern generated by any of the system alerts.

156 Patients, however, were able to contact their care manager at any time.

157 Based on data collected, the care manager requested the patient take a picture of the surgical site

158 for assessment and comparison with previously collected images. All images as well as other

159 information such as, system alerts or aberrant results, when persistent, were shared with the

160 medical director to proactively manage the patients in between in-person visits. The care

161 management team established the following thresholds for bio-sensor system alerts: high systolic

162 (>150 mmHG), low systolic (<90 mmHG), high diastolic (>90 mmHG), low systolic (<50

163 mmHG), high pulse (>100 BPM), low pulse (<60 BPM), low oxygen saturation (<90%), weight


164 +/- 10 lbs of baseline, and temperature > 101[0] (Fahrenheit). In addition, quiz alerts were

165 generated when any of the following responses were provided for the accompanying quiz

166 questions: “How is your pain today?”, a score of 8 or more; “To me, the surgical incision site

167 appears”, to be getting worse; “Discharge or leakage of fluid form any part of the surgical site”,

168 is yellow or green or is present but looks different from choices above; “Swelling or redness

169 around the surgical incision is”, worse than yesterday; “In general, how would you rate your

170 mental or emotional health?”, Poor. Participants that did not have in-home Wi-Fi were provided

171 tablets with cellular connectivity to the internet. Care managers had access to the website and

172 were required to log into the website daily, but had the ability to log in at any time. Monitoring

173 equipment, tablets and website were all HIPAA- compliant. Tablets and kits were returned at the

174 first follow-up visit. Tablets and monitoring equipment were physically cleaned and data-wiped

175 before being distributed to the next participant. Four Wi-Fi and four cell coverage tablets were

176 available for distribution.

177

178 Patients in the SOC group received the normal standard of care for vascular surgery patients,

179 which is to apply a sterile dressing immediately after complete closure, and the surgery site

180 assessed 24 hours after the procedure. If there were no local complications, hematomas or

181 dehiscence, patients were discharged with the following instructions. Keep your incision dry for

182 24 hours. If covered, keep it covered for 24 hours. You may shower after 72 hours, pat incision

183 dry with soft towel, do not sit in a tub or soak wound for 1 week (swimming, hot tub included).

194 **Sample:**

195

196 The population for the current study was patients with any planned vascular procedures with cut
197 down access to the infra-inguinal area and treated by one of the board certified vascular surgeons

198 in the Vascular Center of Excellence (VCOE). Sample size estimates were based on infection

199 rates from previous research.[10, 11] An overall sample size of 200 subjects would have 80% power

200 to detect a reduction in the 30-day infection/readmission rate from ~12 in the SOC group to ~2%

201 in the THEM group using a 2-sided α of 0.05. We expected a 10% drop-out rate and planned to

202 enroll 110 patients in each group (N=220 overall). Full enrollment, depending upon the number

203 of patients that agree to participate, would have taken 2 years or longer. Based on available

204 funding, the study enrollment was stopped after one year. Planned patient exclusions included

205 the following: (1) did not plan to do follow-up visit at the VCOE; (2) inability to sign or

206 understand the consent form; and (3) did not have home internet service with Wi-Fi and/or

209 **Statistical Analysis:**


210 All analyses were based on intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. Descriptive statistics

211 are expressed in terms of frequencies, percentages, or means + standard deviation (SD).

212 Categorical variables were tested by chi-square or Fisher exact tests and continuous

213 variables were tested by student t-test or paired t-test for pre/post measures, or repeated

214 measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) where deemed appropriate. All probability values

215 were 2 sided and ‘p’ values <0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses will be

216 performed using SPSS version 19.0 (IBM Corp. Released 2010. IBM SPSS Statistics for

217 Windows, Version 19.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).

218

219 Informed consent was obtained by the research coordinator. Eligible patients were randomly

220 assigned to either the treatment group (THEM) or the control group (SOC). The study protocol

221 was approved by our governing Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted in accordance

222 with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements and the

223 prevailing ethical principles governing research. In addition, the study was registered on

224 https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/;NCT02767011.[12] The randomization was performed centrally

225 using an SPSS computer algorithm. Treating physicians were blinded to the randomization,

226 although one of whom served as medical director of the care management team and was

227 consulted by the care managers during post-surgical treatment decisions. Participants from

228 either group were scheduled for in-home visits from “visiting nurse service (VNS) based on

229 physician preference and comorbid conditions.

231 **RESULTS:**

232


233 Eighty vascular surgery patients were screened for possible inclusion into the current study.

234 After the screening process, 50 patients did not meet inclusion criteria, refused to participate or

235 were excluded from the study results. (Table 2)  Ultimately, thirty patients were enrolled, of

236 which 16 (53.3%) were randomized to the THEM and 14 (46.7%) to the SOC groups. The

237 average age and BMI for THEM and SOC patients were similar (62.5 + 7.2 versus 65.7 + 7.3,

238 p=0.234; and 27.7 + 4.3 versus 29.1 + 7.1, p=0.487). The average driving distance from the

239 vascular center clinic for the THEM patients was similar to those in the SOC group (60.2 + 42.1

240 miles versus 48.6 + 28.5 miles; p=0.393). THEM patients had significantly more

241 hypercholesterolemia 93.8 versus 50.0%, p=0.012. (Table 3)

242

243 There were no significant differences in wound or in 30-day readmissions (6.3% versus 7.1%,

244 p=1.000; and 25.0% versus 14.3%, p=0.657). Interestingly, 30-day infection rates indicated care

245 managers identified marginally more superficial wound problems in the THEM group (31.3%

246 versus 7.1%, p=0.175). There was no difference in the number of patients that received home

247 nursing visits (n=3 each group, p=1.000) or in the average number of visits (THEM 1.3 + 2.9 vs

248 SOC 1.4 + 2.9, p=0.967). Both groups reported an increase in SF8 physical summary scores, but

249 the increase was more pronounced in THEM (pre-post delta = 9.0 versus 4.5) patients (p=0.076).

250 There was no significant difference between the two groups for SF8 mental health summary

251 score. THEM patients reported a significantly greater improvement in quality of life on three of

252 the SF8 quality subscales. The difference for THEM patients on the physical-function subscale

253 (pre-post delta) was 7.5 versus 1.1 for the SOC group (p=0.002). The difference for THEM

254 patients on the role-physical subscale (pre-post delta) was 8.7 versus 1.1 for the SOC group

255 (p<0.001). The pre-post delta difference for THEM patients on the role-emotional subscale was


256 6.3 versus -0.5 for the SOC group (p=0.030). THEM patients reported trends for higher

257 satisfaction in terms of general satisfaction, technical quality and accessibility for PSQ18 survey

258 questions (4.2 versus 3.7, p=0.072; 4.5 versus 4.1, p=0.081; and 4.2 versus 3.8, p=0.063),

259 respectively. (Table 4)

260

261 _Ancillary findings:_

262

263 Sensor data was collected by the bio-sensors, uploaded to the tablets via Bluetooth and then

264 synced with the care management website. The sensor data revealed 207 blood pressure and

265 pulse rate measurements. The average systolic blood pressure was (mean,+SD ) 132.4 + 18.6

266 mmHG. The average diastolic blood pressure was 79.6 + 13.9 mmHG. The average pulse rate

267 was 78.3 + 15.8 BPM. There were 33 (15.9%) high systolic alerts (>150 mmHG), 37 (17.9%)

268 high diastolic alerts (>90 mmHG), 19 (9.2%) high pulse alerts (>100 BPM) and 24 (11.6%) low

269 pulse alerts (<60 BPM). The average oxygen saturation rate was 94.8% + 3.8% with 21 (9.7%)

270 low (<90%) alerts. The average weight was 167.2 + 36.2 lbs. There were some system alerts

271 generated by large variations in daily weight +10 lbs. However, it was discovered that the large

272 variations or discrepancies in weights were explained by non-standard methods for obtaining

273 weight, such as different mode of dress or at a different time of day. Daily temperature

274 monitoring resulted in no alerts.

276 In addition, and not counting some inadvertent shutter pushes, THEM patients took 141

277 photographs (mean 8.8 + SD; range 0-27 9.7) to be shared with the care management team. Four

278 patients in the THEM arm had superficial wound infections that were treated without the need


279 for an emergency room visit or an unscheduled office visit. Anecdotally, these patients told the

280 care managers that they were very satisfied to take photographs and have them reviewed by a

281 physician. Subsequently, the physician called in prescriptions for antibiotics to the patients’

282 local pharmacies. Interestingly, patients that took photographs indicating no infection were also

283 anecdotally pleased to receive reassurance from a physician. One patient in THEM with a deep

284 wound infection was a redo-surgery for a graft wound infection, and in retrospect, current wound

285 infection should have been part of our exclusion criteria. Another patient in THEM had a

286 chronic non-healing wound. However, he had a closed bypass graft. Ultimately, three patients

287 in THEM were sent to the hospital for emergency room visits, but their visits can be explained

288 by clinical conditions that were not associated with the cut down procedure or infection. One

289 was admitted with the deep wound infection (i.e., mentioned above), one with pulmonary

290 embolism and the other had a non-wound related problem (urinary retention) and suspected deep

291 vein thrombosis which was ruled out by non-invasive duplex ultrasound testing.

292

293 THEM patients had phone and electronic access to a care manager 7 days a week. The majority

294 of THEM patients also rated the Enform™ technology easy to use (27/33 = 82%). Often care

295 managers scheduled follow-up appointments, answered post-discharge questions, procured

296 prescriptions and consequently provided direct access to the care management team. THEM

297 patients became involved in monitoring their own bio-markers. This is evidenced by their

298 responses to the daily and weekly quiz questions. Tables 5a & 5b) As you can see the quiz

299 question, “During the past week, would you say that information you provided to your Care

300 Manager(s) via Enform™ enriched the conversation or quality of care provided?” most

301 respondents (27/33 = 82%) selected “Definitely yes.” In addition, there were several anecdotal


302 comments made to the care managers that also support this belief. For example, one patient

303 reported to a care manager, “I knew you were going to call because my blood pressure was high

304 this morning.”

305

306 **Discussion:**

307

308 Many researchers have evaluated utilization of THEM in several evolving aspects of vascular

309 surgery. Chisci et al evaluated a THEM consultation model for planning and treatment of

310 complex thoracoabdominal aortic disease (TAAD) and concluded that THEM may allow

311 inexperienced surgeon to acquire and share knowledge from experienced surgeons at larger

312 institutions.[13] Another important aspect of using THEM in postoperative wound care is the

313 potential to facilitate transition of care and to decrease readmission for surgical site infections. [14]

314 We found no significant differences in wound or 30-day readmissions (6.3% versus 7.1%,

315 p=1.000; and 25.0% versus 14.3%, p=0.657). However, the central reason for not detecting any

316 significant difference between groups was likely due to our low enrollment numbers, which will

317 be discussed below.

318

319 Despite our lack of a primary statistically significant finding, we found several instances where

320 our results suggested the benefit of using THEM and increased quality of life and patient

321 satisfaction. THEM patients had a more pronounced change in pre/post SF-8 physical summary

322 scores (p=0.076). In addition, THEM patients had more pronounced effects for three of the

323 subscales as well (i.e., physical function, physical role and mental health; all interactions <0.05).

324 Besides quality of life measures, there was some evidence for THEM patients being more


325 satisfied with their health care. We found marginal trends for THEM patients to have more

326 general satisfaction, rate technical quality and accessibility higher (p values ranged from 0.063 –

327 0.081). As compared to others, [1-3, 6, 15] the current study went beyond a feasibility type of study

328 and provided real world evidence that suggests patients will adopt and accept remote monitoring.

329 THEM patients rated remote monitoring and medical device technology as easy to use and

330 believed that their efforts enriched the quality of care that they received.

331

332 There are many potential uses for telehealth communications including reaching out to

333 communities in underserved areas, achieving better quality of patient care, avoiding

334 hospitalization, producing cost savings, improving surgeons’ experience, providing an

335 opportunity for international consultation to underdeveloped countries and expansion of medical

336 knowledge and techniques among health professionals. [1] In our study, THEM patients lived an

337 average of 60.2 miles from the vascular care center with some 31.3% more than 77 miles

338 requiring a two to three hour drive. The patients that received call-in prescriptions were very

339 satisfied and grateful for the continuity of care and were glad that they did not have to make a

340 trip back to the vascular center.

341

342 In the current study, care managers used system alerts and wound pictures to determine whether

343 a consultation with the medical director was necessary. Even though it was of secondary interest,

344 we found patients to be appreciative of the direct connection to the care management team and

345 took advantage of this opportunity by having the care managers to schedule follow-up

346 appointments, answer post-discharge questions and help procure prescription medications.

347 Although somewhat underutilized [7], THEM can be used as a useful tool to minimize the costs


348 and challenges for postoperative vascular patients. Endean et al [3] reported the efficacy and

349 accuracy of THEM, and concluded that the evaluation of vascular patients is accurate and as

350 effective as on-site evaluations for a variety of vascular problems. Yet, important adjuncts

351 enhance the success of the evaluation are physician experience with the technology and the

352 presence of a knowledgeable on-site assistant. This technology can be easily adapted to other

353 clinical situations.

354

355 Another important aspect of THEM is the potential to improve quality of care in both outpatient

356 and inpatient wound care along with decreased medical cost and hospital resources by allowing

357 home care nurses to electronically transmit images of patients' wounds to treating surgeons. In

358 our study, nurse care mangers were able to have uninterrupted access to the condition of the

359 patient’s wounds and maintained uninterrupted access to a supervising physician 24/7. Likewise,

360 THEM patients had phone and electronic access to a care manager 7 days a week. THEM

361 patients rated the technology as easy to use and believed these efforts impacted their health care.

362 Often care managers served as the direct connection to the health care system by scheduling

363 follow-up appointments, answering post-discharge questions and helping to procure prescriptions

364

365 In another vascular surgery study[2], the authors concluded that wound evaluation on the basis of

366 viewing digital images is comparable with standard wound examination and renders similar

367 diagnoses and treatment in the majority of cases. In our study, THEM patients took 141

368 photographs all of which were shared with the care management physician. Four of these photos

369 contained elements of superficial wound infections, all of which were treated by calling in a

370 prescription to a local pharmacy without the need for an emergency room visit or an unscheduled


371 office visit. Interestingly, patients were pleased to have their photographs reviewed by a

372 physician, whether antibiotic or reassurance of no infection was provided. Although not

373 measured, the photographic images seemed to be high quality and easily used by the care team to

374 make assessments about the patients’ wound conditions. However, it is possible that THEM

375 technology provided an extra level of scrutiny which, led to increased or unnecessary diagnosis,

376 treatment or prescription medication. With this in mind, we believe that sharing information

377 among the care team members served to decrease the possibility of over utilization.

378

379 Although we found no significant differences for wound or any readmissions, or any of the office

380 or home nursing visits, it was noteworthy that three THEM patients were sent to the emergency

381 room. One was admitted with deep wound infection (i.e., the one that was a redo graft

382 infection), one for suspected PE and one with urinary retention where suspected DVT was ruled

383 out. Thus, we suspect an added benefit of THEM technology is to provide better and continuous

384 health care, perhaps avoiding a more complicated septic course or death.

385

386 Insurance companies are beginning to reimburse patients and providers for telehealth services,

387 which should help to drive health care costs down.[16, 17] On the other hand, THEM technology

388 carries potential concerns such as availability of internet service, cost of devices or internet

389 service, ease of usability as some patients are typically not as device-savvy (e.g., as the newer

390 generation), privacy of information according to HIPAA, concerns on scams from internet and a

391 general right to privacy. Therefore, at a minimum, we recommend these issues to be considered

392 thoroughly by the hospital’s legal and information technology teams in order to provide the best

393 options for patients.


394

395 **Limitations:**

396

397 A major limitation of the findings for the current research study was sample size. There were


398 several reasons for the lower than planned enrollment number. First, funding was only available

399 for one year and thus limited the amount of time for open enrollment. Next, it took some time to

400 develop a good method for identifying potential participants and providing them with the

401 opportunity to learn about the study. Efforts were made to make contact with the patients during

402 their pre-admission testing visit to introduce the general idea of participating in the study, but

403 this was not always possible and in some cases contact was not before the procedure. Lastly, and

404 perhaps equally important was the number of patients who refused to participate. Although our

405 percentage of refusals was somewhat expected (22/80=27.5%), additional efforts in pre-study

406 design could have potentially increased our yield. Nine of the 22 patients who refused did so

407 because of apprehension to the technology. Perhaps a 10-15 minute video describing the study

408 could have reduced some of the apprehension about the technological aspects of the study.

409

410 **Conclusion:**

411

412 THEM was technically feasible and provided some benefit to patients in geographically disparate

413 areas. THEM was associated with increased patient satisfaction. Additional findings suggested

415 care professionals. Telehealth successfully merged remotely generated information with care

416 manager interaction. Presently, a larger study, preferably multicenter, is warranted.
