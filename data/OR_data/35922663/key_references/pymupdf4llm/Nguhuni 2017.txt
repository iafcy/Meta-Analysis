Abstract

Background: Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common post-operative complication causing significant morbidity
and mortality. Many SSI occur after discharge from hospital. Post-discharge SSI surveillance in low and middle
income countries needs to be improved.

Methodology: We conducted an observational cohort study in Dodoma, Tanzania to examine the sensitivity and
specificity of telephone calls to detect SSI after discharge from hospital in comparison to a gold standard of clinician
review. Women undergoing caesarean section were enrolled and followed up for 30 days. Women providing a telephone
number were interviewed using a structured questionnaire at approximately days 5, 12 and 28 post-surgery. Women
were then invited for out-patient review by a clinician blinded to the findings of telephone interview.

Results: A total of 374 women were enrolled and an overall SSI rate of 12% (n = 45) was observed. Three hundred and
sixteen (84%) women provided a telephone number, of which 202 had at least one telephone interview followed by a
clinical review within 48 h, generating a total of 484 paired observations. From the clinical reviews, 25 SSI were diagnosed,
of which telephone interview had correctly identified 18 infections; telephone calls did not incorrectly identify SSI in any
patients. The overall sensitivity and specificity of telephone interviews as compared to clinician evaluation was 72 and
100%, respectively.

Conclusion: The use of telephone interview as a diagnostic tool for post-discharge surveillance of SSI had moderate
sensitivity and high specificity in Tanzania. Telephone-based detection may be a useful method for SSI surveillance in
low-income settings with high penetration of mobile telephones.

Introduction
Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common
healthcare-associated infections (HAI) [1, 2], especially
in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) [3–5].
Caesarean section (CS) is among the most frequent surgical interventions in women worldwide [6, 7]. However,
CS increases the risk of post-partum infections by 5 to
20-fold compared to vaginal delivery [8, 9]. Despite
modern surgical techniques and antibiotic prophylaxis,
SSI is still contributing significantly to morbidity, mortality and healthcare-associated costs [6, 10, 11]. Data
from Tanzania report SSI incidences of 10.9, 24% and as
high as 48% [6, 12, 13]. Many SSI occur after discharge
from hospital, typically occurring between 5 and 10 days
post-operatively. The burden of SSI is therefore liable to
be underestimated by any HAI surveillance system that
does not capture information after discharge from
hospital [14, 15].
There is no scientific consensus on an ideal method of
detecting SSI after discharge from hospital and different
approaches have been employed in different settings

[16–19]. However, there is emerging evidence that patients are able to diagnose and report their own SSI with
an acceptable accuracy if prompted with the appropriate
questions via telephone calls [14–16, 20]. Evaluations of
such telephone-based methods in LMIC including comparison to a “gold-standard” reference diagnosis is very
limited so substantial uncertainty remains about the
reliability of these methods [21].
The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility,
sensitivity and specificity of the use of a structured questionnaire administered through telephone interview as a
method for detecting post-discharge SSI after CS. The
survey was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Tanzania.
We also sought to estimate the overall risk of SSI occurring in a 30-day post-operative period in this population.

Methodology
Study design
Prospective observational cohort study.

Study site
Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department of the Dodoma
Regional Referral Hospital (DRRH), Dodoma, Tanzania.
The average number of women delivering at DRRH is
around 1000 per month, with CS accounting for around
20% of deliveries.

Period of study
Two month enrollment period from May to June 2015.

Study population
All women admitted at DRRH labour ward who underwent
CS were enrolled within 24 h of surgery and were followed


up for 30 days for development of SSI, in accordance with
the United States Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) criteria for diagnosis of SSI [20].

Data collection and follow up
Data were retrieved from the patients using a structured
questionnaire and through medical records. All women
were asked to provide one or more mobile telephone
numbers, either a personal phone and/or that of a relative for communication after discharge. Before discharge,
women were educated on proper wound care at home
and were asked to attend Makole Health Centre (MHC)
for wound inspection, dressing and consultation with
medical doctors at day 7 post-CS. Before this scheduled
visit, all women who provided a mobile number were
contacted on day 5 or 6 post-CS and a brief structured
interview regarding the status of the wound was conducted. The telephone interview questions were related
to signs and symptoms of infection including history of
fever, pus discharge from the wound, pain or redness at
the surgical wound, use of antibiotics or any drugs to
support wound healing and presence of obvious gaping
of the wound or protrusion of internal structures.
Patients were also reminded to attend MHC within 48 h
of the phone interview. The phone call was performed
by a clinically-trained investigator or a registered nurse
who had received appropriate training on the telephone
interview questionnaire. The diagnosis of SSI was made
using an algorithm based on the CDC classification system [22]. At the MHC follow-up clinic, patients were
evaluated by different clinicians who were trained on the
CDC criteria for diagnosis of SSI and unaware of the
findings of the telephone interview. Phone call interviews were also performed on days 12 and 28 post-CS
prior to additional scheduled visits on days 14 and 30
post-CS, respectively. Patients did not receive any kind
of incentives or fare reimbursements to attend the clinic
during the study.

Data analysis
Data were analysed using STATA software (Version
12.0, STATA Corp, College Station, Texas, USA). To determine the sensitivity and specificity of phone calls, an
analysis was performed using all paired observations of
telephone call interview and clinician review (which was
considered as the gold standard) that occurred within
48 h of each other. We performed the analysis using the
paired observations at each separate time-point and at
all the three time-points combined.

Results
A total of 374 women who underwent CS during the
study period were enrolled. Patients’ characteristics are
shown in Table 1.

Use of telephone calls in detection of SSIs
Three hundred and sixteen (84%) enrolled women provided a telephone number. Phone calls were successfully
made on at least one occasion to 274 patients, representing 87% (274/316) of patients with a telephone number.
Forty-two (13%) patients were not reachable after at
least two attempts. Among the 274 successfully interviewed patients, 202 attended for a clinician review


within 48 h of the interview at least once during the
study. A total of 484 paired observations (telephone call
interviews and clinician reviews) within 48 h of each
other were generated across the three time-points. From
all observation pairs, 18 telephone interviews identified
an SSI, all sub-classified as “superficial”. In clinical review, 25 SSI were diagnosed corresponding to an SSI
rate of 12.3%, including all 18 Superficial SSI identified by telephone interview, plus 7 further infections
(4 Superficial, 2 Deep and 1 Organ/Space). When
considering just single time-points, similar proportions of patient with SSI were identified at the day 7
and day 14 time-points, but no patients with SSI were
identified at the day 30 time-point, either by telephone call
or clinical review as shown in Table 2.
Using this combined set of all paired observations, the
sensitivity and specificity of telephone interviews against
a clinical review gold-standard were 72% (95% CI 50.6–
87.9) and 100% (95% CI 99.2–100), respectively while
positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive
value (NPV) were 100% (95% CI 81.5–100) and 95.9%
(95% CI 96.9–99.4), respectively as presented in Table 2.
Logistically, each telephone call interview required between 3 and 5 min and the direct cost was approximately US$0.50.

Risk of SSI, based on different follow-up strategies
Out of 374 women, an overall SSI rate of 12.0% (n = 45)
was observed and confirmed by clinical review. All SSI
occurred after initial discharge from hospital which was
typically within 10 days after CS. The median interval
from surgery to clinical diagnosis was 8 days (IQR 7–
11 days). Sixty eight percent (n = 254) of enrolled
women attended the outpatient clinic at least once
within 30 days post-CS, with complete loss to clinical
follow-up occurring in 120 (32%) women. According to
the CDC classification of SSI, 42/45 (93%) were Superficial, 2 (4.4%) were Deep and 1 (2.2%) was an Organ/
Space infection. As shown in Table 3, we retrospectively
determined what SSI risk might have been found by
using partial elements of the telephone-based SSI surveillance. Based on these data, we find that combination
of two phone calls at day 7 and day 14 would have detected almost 90% of SSI cases.

Discussion
The overall sensitivity and specificity of telephone call
interview to detect SSI in comparison to direct clinical
evaluation was 72 and 100%, based on 484 paired observations. The sensitivity was not statistically different at
day 7 (79%) and day 14 (64%). No infections were detected by telephone call interviews or clinical reviews to
detect SSI at day 30 post-surgery, suggesting that there

is limited value for reviews, either clinical or telephonebased at this time-point.
Our estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of this
method might have been affected by the 48 h interval
between telephone interview and review by clinicians,
since some infections may have become symptomatic at
this time. This might lead to underestimation of the sensitivity. A substantial number of patients were not reachable by mobile phones, which means that the use of
phone calls as a stand-alone tool would be unlikely to
detect all SSI.
Some other studies have described a role for telephone
call interviews for SSI surveillance in LMIC [13, 16, 21, 23].
Our study is, to our knowledge, the largest-ever direct
evaluation of the role of telephone interview in SSI surveillance in an African country. The results from our study are
similar to a smaller-scale research conducted in Kenya,
which also observed moderate sensitivity and high specificity of phone calls as a stand-alone test for SSI [14]. However, telephone interview did not detect the “Deep” and
“Organ/Space”” SSI that were detected in this study, which
is potentially a cause for concern as these represent the
most serious forms of SSI.
As in many other SSI studies [21, 24, 25], the postdischarge surveillance was affected by significant loss to
follow up. The failure to attend the clinic might be related to the difficulty, distance and cost for women to
reach the clinic. For clinical review-based methods of

SSI surveillance, this means that an operating centre is
liable to miss the occurrence of post-operative complication and hence underestimate local SSI risks. However, if
SSI surveillance systems made greater use of telephone call-based methods, more accurate estimates
might be obtained.
In Tanzania, as in many LMICs, there is now relatively
high penetration of mobile phones for communication
and other uses including electronic money transfers.
This technology represents a significant opportunity for
public health and disease surveillance systems. Amongst
women of child-bearing age in Dodoma, 85% were able
to provide a mobile phone number. However, there are
also barriers to contacting by phone beyond ownership, which is reflected by our finding that only 87%
of those providing a phone number were successfully
contacted. As in other studies, the telephone call interviews were well received by both the patients and
the healthcare workers].
The cumulative incidence of post-CS SSI in this study
was 12% which is substantially reduced from an incidence of 48% described at DRRH in 2013 in a previous
study [26]. Given the substantial loss to follow-up, this
value may underestimate the true occurrence of postoperative risk of infection. This SSI rate is lower than
typically reported in Tanzania, however is comparable to
other studies conducted in LMICs but it is significantly
higher than those typically reported in high-income
countries (6,10,12,26)]. As observed in other similar
studies, the commonest type of infection was Superficial

[6, 10, 12, 27]. According to our data, the majority of
SSIs were detected within ten days post-CS, indicating
that contamination in the operating theatre is liable to
be a significant underlying causal factor [6, 28].

Conclusion
The occurrence of SSI represents a substantial risk after
surgery in LMICs and appropriate detection of these
events is difficult when patients have to travel a long distance to reach healthcare facilities. Case ascertainment

of SSI can be achieved by a variety of methods and a
combined approach can be considered. Potentially, the
use of a structured questionnaire administered through
telephone calls for post-operative surveillance might reduce loss to follow-up and improve the quality of
surveillance data. However, although we found the specificity to be very high, further work is needed to explore
how the sensitivity of telephone-based diagnosis and
ability to make contact with patients by telephone could
be further improved, especially in settings where few patients are able to attend for clinical review.
