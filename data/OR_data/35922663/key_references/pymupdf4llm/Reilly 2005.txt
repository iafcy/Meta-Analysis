# A study of telephone screening and direct observation of surgical wound infections after discharge from hospital

**Post-discharge surveillance of surgical site infection is necessary if accurate rates of infection**
**following surgery are to be available. We undertook a prospective study of 376 knee and hip**
**replacements in 366 patients in order to estimate the rate of orthopaedic surgical site**
**infection in the community. The inpatient infection was 3.1% and the post-discharge infection**
**rate was 2.1%. We concluded that the use of telephone interviews of patients to identify the**
**group at highest risk of having a surgical site infection (those who think they have an**
**infection) with rapid follow-up by a professional trained to diagnose infection according to**
**agreed criteria is an effective method of identifying infection after discharge from hospital.**


Surgical site infection (SSI) is an important
indicator of outcome after surgery. The costs
for the patient, hospital and community care
team are high.[1] In England, these have been
estimated to total £61 million per annum, with
a cost per infection of some £3200.[2] National
surveillance systems in the United Kingdom
have been established using the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition
for SSI.[3] However, only mandatory pre-discharge rates of SSI are identified and these
underestimate the true rates of SSI. It is estimated that 70% of post-operative infections
present after discharge.[4]

Surveillance after discharge is challenging as
the patient is no longer under direct medical
supervision. A Department of Health working
group[5] recommended that priority should be
given to procedures involving a short length of
stay. The authors also suggest that direct observation of the surgical site, the most reliable and
valid way of detecting infection, should be
included in the normal patient pathway to
minimise additional cost.
Direct observation in the course of normal
clinical care is easily achieved with procedures
as Caesarean sections, in which patients are
seen routinely during the period after discharge. However, when such post-operative
follow-up is not routine, monitoring all
patients by healthcare workers is costly.[6]

Orthopaedic implant infection rates are
reported to be between 1% and 15% depending
on the methodology and definitions adopted.
These patients are not routinely seen in the six
weeks following surgery and there is no health

care worker in the normal patient pathway during this period. Hence, there is a need to
consider alternative methods of collecting data.
Methods for SSI surveillance after clean surgery include telephone enquiry or questionnaire to patient or surgeon.[7-11] With those
methods infection rates range between 1.5%
and 17%. However, SSI surveillance using
direct observation of the wound for up to 30
days by one observer reported infection rates
between 9% and 16%.[12-15] While it is clear that
direct observation is the most sensitive method
for detecting infection, it is also expensive.[6,16]

Several large studies have suggested that
feedback of the data for SSI to surgeons can
reduce infection rates.[7,17-19] However, the varying definitions used do not allow the comparison of infection rates. Further, where data were
collected beyond the inpatient stay, the followup consisted only of a monthly report, by the
surgeon to the project nurse, of the number of
infections,[7] possibly leading to bias. It may be
that the steadily falling rates of infection
reported by Cruse and Foord[7] and Haley et al[19]

are due to a shorter inpatient stay with an ineffective post-discharge surveillance programme
and not, as assumed, the results of feedback of
the incidence of infection to surgeons.
Recently, attention has been focused on the
patient’s ability to detect surgical infection.
Postal questionnaires returned by the patient
to the hospital have been used,[20,21] but this
approach is limited by the response rate. Some
studies have explored the use of telephone
questionnaires[22,23] as a method of detecting SSI
but it has not been validated It has been iden

tified as a practical method with good response rates. Telephone surveillance could be used to screen-out patients who
report that they do not have a SSI, and allow time for direct
observation of only those who state that they have problems. Direct observation of the patient by a trained observer
has indicated that patients know when they do not have
infections, 98.2% of the time, but only 66% of patients
know when they do have an infection.[24]
Bruce et al[4] have shown that research is needed to formally
assess the reliability of patient self-diagnosis and validate the
performance of the definitions used for SSI in hospital[3] for
use in the community setting. The associated costs of collecting this information need to be considered to determine the
most appropriate healthcare worker to be employed.
The aims of this study were to estimate orthopaedic SSI
in the community and test the validity of both telephone
surveillance and SSI case definitions.

**Patients and Methods**
This was a prospective study of patients who were about to
undergo elective hip or knee arthroplasty and who lived
within Tayside. Patients were excluded if they were unable
to give informed consent, could not communicate directly
by telephone or were inpatients up to 30 days post-operatively.
Consenting participants were given a form to take home
which they were instructed to give to their general practitioners or district nurse should they have any problems
with their wound. All 72 general practice surgeries in Tayside were contacted and provided details of SSI case definitions. They were instructed to post the form back to the
hospital once complete.
All patients were also telephoned by the research nurse
ten, 20 and 30 days post-operatively in order to ascertain
the state of the wound using a standard interview schedule.
At each telephone interview, patients who identified problems with their wound were told to ask their general practitioner or district nurse to complete the form they had been
given on discharge and post it back to the hospital. Independently of this, all patients identifying problems with
their wound, and 10% of those who did not, were visited
by a trained research nurse following the telephone interview, in order to observe their wounds.
**Statistical methods. The effectiveness of telephone surveil-**
lance was investigated through tests of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values.

**Results**
During the study period, 422 patients were admitted, all of
whom were included in the ongoing acute stay surveillance
programme in order to determine accurate inpatient rates.
We excluded patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria. Of the 376 procedures which did satisfy the inclusion
criteria, there were 175 knee replacements and 201 hip
replacements, in 201 women and 165 men. The primary
diagnoses for the procedures are given in Table I

The majority of cases (350) were unilateral. The mean
age was 67 years (30 to 91; SD 10.4). The majority of
patients (78.2%) had a Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance risk index[25] of 0 or 1. This index is based on three risk
factors (American Society of Anaesthesiologists score,
wound class and duration of operation) and scored as 0, 1,
2 or 3. The CDC’s experience is that the infection rate
increases with an increasing risk score.
The research nurse, regarded as the gold standard for the
detection of infection, visited 105 of the 366 patients in
order to assess their wounds. The inpatient infection rate
was 3.1% (13 validated SSI of a total of 422 cases), and the
post-discharge infection rate was 2.1% (eight validated SSI
of the 376 cases included in the surveillance study).
The numbers of patients categorised as infected or not
infected in the telephone surveillance report and by the
research nurse are shown in Table II.
The effectiveness of telephone surveillance was calculated first when responses of ‘not sure’ from patients were
recorded as ‘no infection’ and then when they were classified as infected (Table III).
Of the 1026 telephone reports of no infection problems,
90 were checked by the research nurse and one (1.1%) was
found to have an infection. General practitioners prescribed antibiotics for 39 (11%) of the patients. Thirty-one
of 83 community healthcare worker forms received
recorded the presence of infection, three of which were validated. While the sensitivity and negative predictive value
of community reporting of SSI are high (100% in both
cases), the specificity and positive predictive value are low
(7.4% and 19.4%, respectively).

**Discussion**
This is the first study, to our knowledge to examine the
validity of patient diagnosis of SSI post-discharge using the
CDC definitions [3]

report

When responses of ‘not sure’ were classified as positive
for infection in our study, the method could detect most
infections (90.91%). The positive and negative predictive
values (31.25% and 98.63%, respectively) were comparable with the figures reported by Whitby et al[24] (28.7% and
98.2%).
The categorisation of ‘not sure’ as negative for infection
increased the specificity but decreased the sensitivity of the
method. In addition, a positive result from this categorisation was more likely to indicate the presence of infection
and a negative result was less likely to do so.
The number of patients who were unsure they had an
infection was relatively small and, in the interests of obtaining an accurate measure of the infection rate, they should
be included for follow-up.
This study suggests that patients can reliably self-diagnose SSI and that telephone screening of patients is a valid
method for detecting infection. The specificity of the
method could be maximised if it was used to screen-out
patients with no SSI, allowing direct observation of those
who say they have, or are unsure if they have, an infection.
While community health workers identified all the infections in patients they observed, the specificity of their
assessment was poor. Although this study did not find the
use of community staff in this way a reliable and valid
method for detecting SSI, collaborative work should aim to
find new approaches to enhance communication to
improve surveillance after discharge. It may be useful to
screen patients who believe that they have a wound problem and those that are not sure, or to provide open access
wound clinics.
The infection rate after discharge was higher than the
inpatient rate. Without post-discharge surveillance, eight
infections would not have been detected.
This study was carried out on an orthopaedic patient
population from a single hospital and therefore the methodology needs to be repeated in differing settings and surgical patient populations to assess the applicability of the
findings. Another limitation of our study is the small numbers of patients included
