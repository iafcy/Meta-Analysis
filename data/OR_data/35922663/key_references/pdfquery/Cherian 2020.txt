Background: We aimed to develop and validate a screening algorithm to assist community health workers 
(CHWs) in identifying surgical site infections (SSIs) after cesarean section (c-section) in rural Africa. 
Methods: Patients were adult women who underwent c-section at a Rwandan rural district hospital between 
March and October 2017. A CHW administered a nine-item clinical questionnaire 10 – 3 days post-operatively. 
Independently, a general practitioner (GP) administered the same questionnaire and assessed SSI presence by 
physical examination. The GP’s SSI diagnosis was used as the gold standard. Using a simpliﬁed Classiﬁcation 
and Regression Tree analysis, we identiﬁed a subset of screening questions with maximum sensitivity for the 
GP and CHW and evaluated the subset’s sensitivity and speciﬁcity in a validation dataset. Then, we compared 
the subset’s results when implemented in the community by CHWs with health center-reported SSI. 
Results: Of the 596 women enrolled, 525 (88.1%) completed the clinical questionnaire. The combination of 
questions concerning fever, pain, and discolored drainage maximized sensitivity for both the GPs (sensitiv- 
ity = 96.8%; speciﬁcity = 85.6%) and CHWs (sensitivity = 87.1%; speciﬁcity = 73.8%). In the validation dataset, this 
subset had sensitivity of 95.2% and speciﬁcity of 83.3% for the GP-administered questions and sensitivity of 76.2% 
and speciﬁcity of 81.4% for the CHW-administered questions. In the community screening, the overall percent 
agreement between CHW and health center diagnoses was 81.1% (95% conﬁdence interval: 77.2%–84.6%). 
Conclusions: We identiﬁed a subset of questions that had good predictive features for SSI, but its sensitivity 
was lower when administered by CHWs in a clinical setting, and it performed poorly in the community. 
Methods to improve diagnostic ability, including training or telemedicine, must be explored.

burden for patients and health systems [1–3]. The burden 
of SSIs is especially high in low- and middle-income coun- 
tries (LMICs) [4], where incidence rates as high as 30.9% 
have been reported [5]. Most SSIs develop 5–10 days after 
surgery [6], and SSI rates are underestimated severely when 
the observation period for infections is limited to a patient’s 
hospital stay [7–9]. However, after discharge, there is no 
reliable method to identify infections among surgical patients 
in the community [10].

Globally, one in every 14 operations is a cesarean section 
(c-section), and in low-resource settings, c-sections consti- 
tute about 30% of the total volume of surgery [11]. In rural 
Rwandan district hospitals, approximately 60% of all oper- 
ations are c-sections [12], and women receive minimal to no 
clinical follow-up after discharge. Notably, our group has 
reported approximately 11% SSIs among women who have 
had a c-section in eastern Rwanda [13]. Given the high fre- 
quency of c-sections and the prevalence of SSIs, monitoring 
SSIs after discharge from the hospital is critical. Studies on 
methods of tracking post-c-section infections among patients 
who have been discharged to home have been performed 
predominantly in high-income countries [14–16], with few 
carried out in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [17,18]. The SSA 
papers did not specify the criteria used to diagnose an incision 
as infected. A valid and reliable method for detecting post- 
discharge SSI in LMICs could result in timely provision of 
care to women after c-section, thus avoiding serious com- 
plications and improving options for SSI surveillance. 
In many countries, community health workers (CHWs) 
provide care for mothers and their children in their own 
homes or villages [19]. In Rwanda, a special cadre of ma- 
ternal CHWs provides pre-natal care to all mothers and post- 
partum care for women who deliver vaginally [20]. However, 
these CHWs do not provide care for women after c-section 
delivery, requiring that these mothers travel to their health 
center for post-discharge care. Leveraging this existing cadre 
of specialized CHWs to provide post-discharge SSI moni- 
toring using a mobile telephone could be feasible, cost ef- 
fective, and scalable. 
We aimed to develop and validate a screening algorithm 
for use by CHWs via mobile health technology to identify 
SSIs and for prompt referral of women to receive health care 
after c-section if a SSI is suspected. We report data from two 
distinct phases. In the ﬁrst phase, we developed and validated 
a simple screening algorithm to identify post-c-section SSIs. 
In the second phase, we compared the results of the screening 
tool when implemented in the ﬁeld setting with health center- 
reported SSI. Combined, these results provide a basis for 
other teams considering community screening for SSIs after 
discharge. 


This study included women who underwent c-section at 
Kirehe District Hospital (KDH) in rural eastern Rwanda. 
KDH serves a population of approximately 370,000 people 
and is operated by the Rwandan Ministry of Health with 
technical and logistic support from the non-governmental 
organization Partners In Health. Typically, in Kirehe District, 
a laboring mother ﬁrst presents at one of the district’s 16 
health centers for delivery under the supervision of a nurse. If 
the nurse identiﬁes an emergency condition, the mother is 
referred to KDH for delivery. At KDH, a midwife examines 
the mother, and a general practitioner (GP) determines 
whether a c-section is indicated. In rare cases, a mother can 
present directly to KDH, bypassing the health center, either 
because of an emergency or if she has private insurance. After 
cesarean delivery, the mother is admitted to the maternity 
ward for recovery and post-operative follow-up. Typically, 
the mother is discharged on post-operative day (POD) 3 un- 
less there is a clinical indication necessitating a longer stay. 
At discharge, nurses recommend the mother to return to her 
nearest health center every two or three days for the subse- 
quent three weeks for post-partum follow-up and care, in- 
cluding dressing changes and monitoring of the incision. 


Phase 1. All women 18 years of age or older who deliv- 
ered via c-section at KDH between March 23 and October 18, 
2017 were eligible for inclusion. We excluded women who 
were not residents of Kirehe District; women who were resi- 
dents of Mahama Refugee Camp, as they did not have au- 
tonomy to complete study follow-up; and women who were 
not discharged by POD 10. All eligible women were identiﬁed 
after c-section and before discharge, informed of the study 
objectives and procedures, and invited to participate. We ob- 
tained signed informed consent forms from all consenting 
participants. At discharge, participants were asked to return to 



KDH at POD 10 – 3 days to have their incisions evaluated and 
undergo the screening questionnaire for SSI. Participants re- 
ceived a voucher to reimburse transportation costs and com- 
pensate them for survey participation, payable at the time of 
return for their screening visit. Study staff attempted to contact 
participants a day before their screening visit to remind them 
of their appointment. For any participants who missed their 
ﬁrst screening visit, the study staff attempted to contact them 
by telephone and reschedule their visit for the next screening 
day. Participants who missed both screening days were con- 
sidered lost to follow-up. Further details on study methods for 
Phase 1 are described elsewhere [13]. 
Phase 2. All women 18 years of age or older who un- 
derwent cesarean delivery between November 1, 2017 and 
September 4, 2018 were eligible for inclusion; the same eli- 
gibility criteria and enrollment procedures used in Phase 1 
were applied. For Phase 2, at discharge, the enrolled partici- 
pants were randomized to one of three arms: Arm 1 = a CHW 
visits the participant at home post-operatively to administer an 
SSI screening questionnaire; Arm 2 = a CHW calls the par- 
ticipant on the telephone post-operatively to administer the 
questionnaire, with as many as three call attempts; Arm 3 = the 
standard of care, with no specialized follow-up. For both in- 
tervention arms, participants were screened by the CHW (at 
home or on the telephone) on POD 10 – 3. On POD 30, a study 
staff member called the participants to inquire about any fur- 
ther visits to healthcare facilities after discharge from the 
hospital. Additional details on study methods, including ran- 
domization process, for Phase 2 are described elsewhere [21]. 

For both phases, data collectors compiled sociodemographic 
information through interviews with patients and health in- 
formation through chart extraction. 
Phase 1. At the screening visit, each participant under- 
went an assessment by a CHW, who administered 10 ques- 
tions pertaining to the patient’s incision. The CHW was hired 
exclusively for the study using the same community nomi- 
nation and selection process used for CHW selection in 
Rwanda [20]. 
Only female CHWs were hired to suit the Rwandan cul- 
tural norms. The CHWs underwent intensive training on 
administering the protocol questions and physical examina- 
tion. The candidate questions were adapted from those used 
in previous research in Haiti [22] with input from Rwandan 
clinicians and included: 
1. Reported increase in pain since discharge; 
2. Any reported fever since discharge; 
3. Erythema (redness); 
4. Edema (swelling); 
5. Induration (ﬁrmness); 
6. Dehiscence (gaping); 
7. Drainage from the incision; 
8. Thick drainage; 
9. Drainage with discoloration; and 

ministered the same 10 questions independently and made a 
diagnosis of the presence or absence of an SSI. All data were 
entered directly into a REDCap [23] database on a password- 
protected study computer. 
Data from March 23 to July 22, 2017 were used to develop 
the screening algorithm (‘‘development dataset’’). Data from 
July 23 to October 18, 2017 were used to validate the algo- 
rithm (‘‘validation dataset’’). For both analyses, we consid- 
ered the GP SSI diagnosis to be the gold standard. To develop 
the screening algorithm, we compared the responses to each 
of the screening questions collected by the CHW with those 
collected by the GP. Next, we assessed each question’s sen- 
sitivity and speciﬁcity, looking separately at the recorded GP 
and CHW responses. 
We considered two approaches for building the SSI 
screening algorithm. First, we considered a participant SSI 
positive if she answered yes to a certain number of original 
screening questions and mapped every possible cut-off on a 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for both GP 
and CHW responses. Second, we applied a simpliﬁed Clas- 
siﬁcation and Regression Tree (CART) analysis. For this 
approach, we started with the most sensitive question. We 
then removed all participants with a positive record for this 
question and considered the most sensitive question among 
the remaining participants. We continued to remove partici- 
pants with a positive recorded value iteratively and consid- 
ered the next most sensitive question until none of the 
remaining questions detected any more of the SSIs. If there 
were questions with equally high sensitivity at any stage, we 
explored paths with each possible combination of questions. 
At each stage of question selection, we reported the sensitivity 
and speciﬁcity of the algorithm. From these two approaches, 
we determined a recommended SSI screening algorithm, a 
subset of the original candidate questions that we thought were 
the most appropriate to detect SSIs in this context. Using the 
validation dataset, we assessed the sensitivity and speciﬁcity 
and 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) of the SSI screening algo- 
rithm independently, looking separately at the recorded GP 
and CHW responses. 
Phase 2. We collected responses to the SSI screening 
algorithm for participants in Arms 1 and 2 using a hand-held 
Android-based tablet. The screening questions used in this 
phase were those identiﬁed in Phase 1 (detailed below) and 
included: (1) Reported fever since discharge; (2) reported 
increased pain since discharge; and (3) drainage with dis- 
coloration. If a participant answered ‘‘yes’’ to any of the three 
screening questions, the CHW instructed her to seek further 
evaluation at the participant’s health center. Study staff re- 
viewed healthcare center’s logs to record any patients having 
c-section who were evaluated post-operatively and whether a 
patient was found to have an SSI and treated at the health 
center. At the hospital, the same clinical information was 
captured from the medical charts. On POD 30, participants 
were telephone-called to ask whether they returned for care at 
a health center or hospital. Health center records were largely 
incomplete; however, 228 participants from Arms 1 and 2 
(41.5% of the total from these arms) had both a POD 30 call 
and health center documentation, and the reports of the two 
sources were identical for all of these participants. 
Next, the participant was screened by a GP with experience 
in cesarean deliveries and post-operative care. The GP ad- 
For participants in Arms 1 and 2, we compared the SSI 
diagnosis by the screening algorithm administered by the 


CHW to the health center SSI diagnosis. We report the per- 
cent positive agreement and percent negative agreement and 
95% CI of these two diagnoses, considering the health center 
diagnosis as the bronze standard. 
We received scientiﬁc and ethical approval from the 
Rwanda National Ethics Committee (Kigali, Rwanda, No. 
848/RNEC/2016) as well as from Partners Human Research 
Committee (Boston, MA USA, No. 2016P001943/MGH). 

In Phase 1, a total of 596 women met the inclusion criteria. 
Of these, 525 (88.1%) returned on POD 10 – 3 days for 
evaluation of their incision site. This group included 294 
(56.0%) in the development dataset and 231 (44.0%) in the 
validation dataset. 
In the development dataset, 31 women (10.5% of 294) had 
a GP-diagnosed SSI. Among these, the questions that re- 
ceived the most afﬁrmative responses when administered by 
a GP were having a fever since coming home from the hos- 
pital (n = 13; 41.9%), increasing pain (n = 15; 48.4%), and 
discolored drainage (n = 24; 77.4%) (Table 1). The questions 
that yielded the the largest number of ‘‘yes’’ responses when 
administered by a CHW for those with GP-diagnosed SSI 
were presence of thick drainage (n = 21; 67.7%), discolored 
drainage (n = 25; 80.7%), and drainage with a foul odor 
(n = 20; 64.5%). A gaping incision was indicated by the GP 
for 13 of the women (41.9%) found to have SSI but gaping 
was not identiﬁed by the CHW for these patients. There was 
disagreement between the GP-administered and CHW- 
administered questions (Appendix I). Responses were nearly 
always consistent for redness (96.9%) and least consistent for 
the presence of discolored drainage (83.3%). Drainage alone 
was not sensitive for GP-diagnosed SSI and so was consid- 
ered only in the presence of discoloration, foul odor, or pu- 
rulence, leaving nine possible screening questions for use 
when developing the ﬁnal algorithm. 
Figure 2 shows the ROC curve comparing cut-offs for the 
number of questions with positive responses by GP and CHW 
between those with GP-diagnosed SSI and those without. 
Diagnosing SSI by having an afﬁrmative indication on three or 
more questions yielded moderate sensitivity and high speci- 
ﬁcity for both the GP (sensitivity = 74.2%; speciﬁcity = 98.9%) 
and CHW (sensitivity = 71.0%; speciﬁcity = 89.0%). The re- 
sults of the CART analysis are shown in Figure 3. Color of 
drainage was the most sensitive question for GPs (77.4%) and 
CHWs (80.7%). Two combinations of the GP-administered 
questions maximized 
fever–pain–discolored 
sensitivity: 
drainage (sensitivity = 96.8%; speciﬁcity = 85.6%) and fever– 
gaping incision–discolored drainage (sensitivity = 96.8%;

agreement was 32.0% (95% CI: 14.9%–53.5%), and the 
percent negative agreement was 83.7% (95% CI: 78.2%– 
88.3%) (Table 2). For those in Arm 2, the overall percent 
agreement between the CHWs and health center diagnoses 
was 84.3% (95% CI: 78.6%–89.0%), the percent positive 
agreement was 37.5% (95% CI: 18.8%–59.4%), and the per- 
cent negative agreement was 90.6% (95% CI: 85.3%–94.4%). 
When the two arms were combined, the overall percent 
agreement between the CHWs and health center diagnoses 
was 81.1% (95% CI: 77.2%–84.6%), the percent positive 
agreement was 34.7% (95% CI: 21.7%–49.6%), and the per- 
cent negative agreement was 86.7% (95% CI: 83.0%–89.9%). 

In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a simple 
screening algorithm for CHWs to assist in detecting SSIs 
after discharge to the patients’ homes. We found that the 
combination of questions fever–pain–discolored drainage 
had moderate sensitivity (76.2%) and speciﬁcity (81.4%) 
when used in a hospital setting; however, the same screening 
algorithm had low positive agreement (34.7%) for the CHWs 
compared with the health center diagnosis when administered 
in the community. 
We identiﬁed only two other studies in East Africa, one in 
Kenya [17] and another in Tanzania [18], that aimed to val- 
idate telephone-based assessments for SSI. These studies, 
where post-operative patients were called and asked a series 
of questions about the surgical site and then were evaluated 
by a clinician in person, showed sensitivity similar to what we 
observed for the CHW-administered questions in the hospital 
setting, but it was considerably higher than the positive 
agreement we observed when CHWs administered the 
questions in the community. One plausible explanation for 
the difference is that in the other two regional studies, 
questions were administered by clinically trained staff or 
nurses, whereas in our study, questions were administered by 
CHWs with only primary education and minimal clinical 
training. 
We found differences in screening accuracy between GP- 
and CHW-administered questions in the clinical setting, with 
the screening protocol being less sensitive and speciﬁc when 
administered by a CHW. Participant responses by GPs and

speciﬁcity = 86.7%). For the CHW-administered questions, 
fever–pain–discolored drainage maximized sensitivity (sensi- 
tivity = 87.1%; speciﬁcity = 73.8%). Given the stability of this 
algorithm for both GP and CHW screenings, we moved for- 
ward with this combination of questions for validation. 
In the validation dataset, 21 women (9.1% of 231) were 
considered SSI positive by the GP. In this dataset, the subset 
of questions fever–pain–discolored drainage had a sensitivity 
of 95.2% (95% CI: 76.2–99.9%) and speciﬁcity 83.3% (95% 
CI: 77.6–88.1%) for the GP-administered questions and a 
sensitivity of 76.2% (95% CI: 52.8–91.8%) and speciﬁcity of 
81.4% (95% CI: 75.5–86.4%) for the CHW-administered 
questions. 
In the community screening, the overall percent agreement 
between CHW and health center diagnoses for those in Arm 1 
was 78.6% (95% CI: 73.0%–83.5%), the percent positive

CHWs were conﬂicting, including for patient-reported as- 
sessments such as ‘‘have you had pain since discharge?’’ 
Because CHWs are recruited from within the community 
where they live, they are, presumably, more easily accessible 
to and accepted by community members and understand the 
context of the community better than health facility-based 
clinicians. However, in some SSA countries, the perceived 
inability of CHWs to maintain conﬁdentiality [24,25] and 
lack of formal training [26,27] were reported as barriers to the 
community’s acceptance of CHWs. Further research is nee- 
ded to understand why women in Rwanda who have under- 
gone a c-section communicate their symptoms differently to 
a GP than to a CHW. 
Although we are reluctant to endorse this SSI screening 
algorithm because of its poor performance in the non-clinical 
setting, its high accuracy in the clinical setting and the con- 
sistency of the questions selected during the development 
stage, whether used by GPs or CHWs, suggests that this al- 
gorithm has promise. Future studies need to examine ways to 
improve CHW-administered screening consistency and ac- 
curacy. The CHWs might need more intensive training to be 
able to detect SSIs [28]. CHWs with more education gener- 
ally have better performance [29], and therefore raising the 
educational requirements for CHWs may beneﬁt SSI diag- 
nostic accuracy. Refresher training has improved perfor- 
mance among CHWs in Uganda [30]. On the other hand, 
perhaps SSIs are too complex to be detected by a question- 
naire. Health systems could consider supplementary methods 
such as telemedicine to ensure women who have undergone a 
c-section receive the care they need in a timely manner. 
Studies in the United States have demonstrated that adding 
incision photos to patient-reported clinical information im- 
proved diagnostic accuracy from 67% to 76% (p < 0.001) [31] 
and that simple abdominal operations with short post- 
operative stays (< 4 days) were the procedures most amenable 
to telemedicine follow-up [32]. Our team is exploring the 
feasibility of photograph-based diagnosis of post-cesarean 
SSIs in rural Rwanda. 
Our study has a few limitations. Our sample was small 
compared with national SSI surveillance datasets in high- 
income countries. However, the development and validation 
of an algorithm to detect post-cesarean SSI in SSA has had 
little to no previous exploration, and the proposed algorithm 
had stable properties in the development and validation da- 
taset. Another limitation is that in Phase 2, we did not have a 
GP-conﬁrmed SSI; rather, we relied on the SSI documented 
in the health center chart or reported by the participant on 
follow-up. In addition, we did not have the timing of the 
health center SSI diagnoses, making it plausible that the 
screening occurred at a different time than the diagnosis. 
However, the prevalence of conﬁrmed SSIs in Phase 1 was 
approximately the same as what we observed in Phase 2 
(10.9% versus 10%), and, given that most SSIs develop by 
POD 10, we have strong conﬁdence in these data. A ﬁnal 
limitation is that we used CHWs whose sole task was to 
administer the questionnaire; thus, their workload was not as 
heavy as it would be for a standard CHW in Rwanda. Ad- 
ditional effectiveness research on the feasibility and accu- 
racy of application of SSI screening algorithms by CHWs 
who have other demands would guide the scalability of this 
approach. 

We believe that the combination of questions—fever– 
pain–discolored drainage—has sufﬁcient sensitivity and 
speciﬁcity when administered in a clinical setting and is 
simple enough for CHWs to use for a community-based 
screening for SSIs after cesarean delivery. The CHW- 
administered questions had lower sensitivity in the clinical 
setting and performed poorly in the ﬁeld setting. Additional 
research is needed to stabilize the algorithm so that it excels 
both in and outside of clinical settings. Telemedicine inter- 
vention, along with screening questions, might improve the 
diagnostic accuracy of SSIs that develop after c-section.
