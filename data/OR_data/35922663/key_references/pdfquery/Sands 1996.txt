Although surgical site infections (SSIs) occurring after hospital discharge cause substantial mor 
bidity, their epidemiology is not well understood, and methods for routine postdischarge surveillance 
have not been validated. Inpatient and outpatient surveillance followed 5572 nonobstetric procedures 
among ll)embers of a health maintenance organization with extensive automated records. Records 
were screened for coded diagnoses, tests, and prescriptions and, if positive, were reviewed by reading 
full text. Questionnaires regarding the occurrence of an SSI were sent to the same patients and 
their surgeons. One hundred thirty-two SSIs were documented, of which 84% occurred after hospital 
discharge and 63% were managed outside the surgical facility. Postdischarge SSIs led to an average 
of 4.6 additional ambulatory encounters. Patient and surgeon questionnaires had a sensitivity of 
28% and 15%, respectively. These data suggest that most SSIs occur after discharge and are not 
detectable by conventional surveillance. Nonetheless, they cause substantial resource utilization. 
Postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the 
leading nosocomial causes of morbidity and increased medical 
expense. An estimated 325,000 SSIs occur each year in the 
United States and generate additional medical costs in the range 
of $1-2 billion [1, 2]. 
Routine surveillance for SSIs is recommended by both the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [3] and the 
Surgical Infection Society [4] as a mechanism for reducing the 
rate of these infections, presumably by providing feedback to 
surgeons on their performance [4-6]. SSI surveillance has been 
associated with decreased infection rates of as much as 35%, 
[3, 7] but even if the true effect of surveillance is much less 
than this, it would be highly cost-effective: the cost of surveil 
lance has been estimated to be about one-fifth the cost of 
treating preventable infections [4, 8]. SSI rates are thus widely 
used by hospitals as a quality indicator and as the basis for 
quality improvement efforts. 
Decreasing hospital lengths of stay and increasing use of 
ambulatory surgery may compromise the accuracy of surveil 
lance data [9]. Traditionally, surveillance involved inpatient 
follow-up only, but previous studies have reported that as many 
as 71% of SSIs occur after hospital discharge [10-16]. For 
hospitals to report accurate absolute infection rates or to make

comparisons of rates between hospitals, these infections must 
be identified [9, 16]. However, no reliable method for routine 
postdischarge wound surveillance has been established. Direct 
wound surveillance among outpatients is extremely resource 
intensive, so many hospitals doing postdischarge surveillance 
now rely on responses to questionnaires mailed to either pa 
tients or surgeons [17]. To our knowledge, the performance 
characteristics of these questionnaires have never been rigor 
ously evaluated. At the same time, 
there is little published 
information about resource utilization associated with postdis 
charge SSIs. 
In this study, SSIs occurring before and after discharge were 
identified among members of a health maintenance organiza 
tion for whom detailed information was available for all post 
discharge medical encounters and prescriptions.. For the same 
cohort, we evaluated the performance of mailed patient and 
surgeon questionnaires for detecting postdischarge SSIs and 
estimated the resource utilization associated with these infec 
tions. 

Study population. The study population was drawn from adult 
members of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care (HPHC) who underwent 
a nonobstetric operating room procedure at Brigham and Women's 
Hospital from 10 February 1992 through 7 March 1993. HPHC is 
a multimodel health maintenance organization that included a staff 
model division with ~ 300,000 members in the greater Boston area 
at the time of this study. Members pay a monthly fee, after which 
office visits, urgent care visits, and hospitalizations generate only 
nominal charges. At the time of the study, 92% of persons de 
scribed above received care at centers that used an automated 
medical record system for both daily charting and archiving; only 
members with automated records were included in the study. 
The automated medical record system uses standardized forms 
that are completed for every patient encounter at HPHC centers, 



including telephone calls, office visits (scheduled or unscheduled), 
urgent care visits, and hospitalizations. Information is recorded on 
forms that are customized for the type of encounter: The provider 
either writes in or selects from a list all coded diagnoses, tests, 
procedures, and prescriptions relevant to that encounter and enters 
additional comments as free text. All information, including free 
text, is entered into an automated medical encounter record. The 
results of diagnostic tests are entered directly into the automated 
record linked to the patient encounter during which they were 
ordered. Information about hospitalizations and emergency room 
visits appear in both encounter records and separate administrative 
records. HPHC pharmacies are also computerized and linked to 
the automated medical record. Ninety percent of HPHC members 
have prepaid coverage for pharmaceuticals and so are likely to use 
HPHC pharmacies for any prescriptions that have more than a 
nominal charge at outside pharmacies. 
Brigham and Women's Hospital is the most active surgical facil 
ity for greater Boston HPHC members. HPHC patients undergoing 
surgery were identified within 3 weeks of their procedure from 
the hospital's computerized operating room log, which records 
information on every operation in real time, including procedure 
date, surgeons involved, duration of the procedure, wound class, 
admission status of the patient, and up to three ICD-9 procedure 
codes. 
Identification of SSIs. Hospital-based information about SSIs 
was identified by review of data gathered by the hospital's infection 
control unit, which uses routine microbiology, nurse's notes, and 
surgical ward rounds for surveillance, and review of the inpatient 
charts of all patients receiving the ICD-9 code of 998.5 (postopera 
tive wound infection) before discharge. Outpatient information 
about SSIs was identified by a two-step procedure for reviewing 
outpatient records that used the automated record systems de 
scribed above. The first step was a computerized search of three 
automated data bases. Ambulatory encounter 
records were 
screened for any of 102 diagnostic, testing, or treatment codes that 
may have indicated an SSI. A partial list of these codes is given 
in figure 1. The pharmacy data base was screened for specific 
antibiotic prescriptions, and administrative records were searched 
for all rehospitalizations or emergency room visits and their corre 
sponding ICD-9 codes for those potentially indicative of an SSI. 
The second step was a physician review of full-text outpatient 
records and relevant hospital records for the 30-day postoperative 
period for all patients identified by the computerized search. 
All records with any documentation suggestive of an SSI were 
independently reviewed by 2 infectious disease physicians (K.S. 
and R.P.). Final classification as an SSI required agreement that 
documentation meeting the 1992 CDC definition of SSI [18] was 
present within 30 days of the procedure. For cases in which there 
was disagreement, a third independent review was done by a sur 
geon (G.V.), and the majority opinion was accepted. Because pri 
mary outpatient care was often provided by a physician's assistant, 
a diagnosis ofSSI made by this provider was considered equivalent 
to physician's diagnosis; a physician would have had to review 
the diagnosis and findings in these cases if they involved prescrip 
tion of an antibiotic. 
Assessment of resource utilization. Resource utilization asso 
ciated with postdischarge SSI during the 30-day postoperative pe 
riod was explored by review of outpatient records for patients 
with a confirmed postdischarge infection. All free-text notes were 
reviewed, and encounters for which the principal focus was the 
SSI were identified. Other activities associated with the SSI, such 
as home care visits, prescriptions, and laboratory tests, were also 
identified if there was clear indication that these activities related 
directly to the infection. 

Patients were mailed a 
single-page questionnaire between the 25th and 32nd postoperative 
day. A questionnaire was not sent if the patient had died or was 
an inpatient (either not discharged or discharged and readmitted) 
at the surgical facility during the time window for mailing the 
questionnaire. The patient questionnaire appeared in both English 
and Spanish and was preaddressed and stamped for return. The 
questionnaire provided yes-no checkboxes for questions falling 
within three categories: whether the patient had been treated for 
any problems during the postoperative period, with "infection at 
your surgical incision" as one of the listed choices; whether the 
patient had made any urgent or unplanned visits to any health care 
facility since the operation; and whether any new medications had 
been prescribed since leaving the hospital, with antibiotic listed 
as one of the choices. While open-ended comments were solicited, 
the questionnaire did not focus on the patient's subjective assess 
ment of the wound, which has been shown to correlate poorly with 
physician findings [19]. 

Surgeons were mailed a form every 4 weeks that listed their 
surgical cases among the study population from 4-8 weeks earlier. 
The form displayed patient name, date of the procedure, and type 
of procedure. Adjacent to the patient name, the surgeon was asked 
to indicate whether an SSI occurred, with the possible responses 
being "definite," "possible," "no," or "don't know." The form 
was sent with a cover letter explaining that responses would not 
be used to assess individual surgeon performance and listing the 
CDC definition of SSI in abbreviated form. Surgeons were not 
notified of the concurrent chart review and patient questionnaire. 
Surgical procedures were categorized according to 
the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System (NNIS), 
which classifies all ICD-9 surgical codes into 44 operative catego 
ries (42 of which are nonobstetric), primarily on the basis of ana 
tomic location of the surgery {20]. Procedures that do not qualify 
as operative procedures (for example, needle biopsy, transurethral 
prostatectomy) by the NNIS were included in the analysis as a 
separate nonoperative category. The NNIS categories were then 
collapsed into 10 new categories based on surgical specialty. SSI 
rates were calculated for each of the NNIS nonobstetric operative 
categories and for each of the 10 larger procedure categories. 
Attack rates were calculated for predischarge, postdischarge, and 
total events. 
Positive questionnaire responses for procedures not identified 
as associated with an SSI were investigated by chart review to 
determine whether these were false-positive responses or true SSIs 
that had been missed by our case-finding methodology. 
Performance characteristics of patient and surgeon question 
naires were compared with the record review procedure by calcula 
tion of sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for a 
positive questionnaire response. Calculations were made both for 
procedures for which a questionnaire was returned and for the 
entire population, in which case an unreturned questionnaire was 
considered negative.. In addition, for surgeon questionnaires, per 
formance was evaluated by interpreting "possible SSI" first as a 
positive response and then as a negative response.

cord codes used to screen postdischarge medical encoun-

sent actual number of codes used in screening for that 
category. 

























The performance of each separate component of our automated 
screening strategy was also evaluated and compared with aggregate 
performance and with the results of hospital-based surveillance. 
We considered inpatient ICD-9 discharge diagnosis codes; emer 
gency room ICD-9 diagnosis codes; ambulatory care diagnosis, 
test, and treatment codes as a group; obtaining wound or blood 
~ultures in the ambulatory setting; and dispensing of the 10 princi 
pal oral antibiotic agents used to treat SSIs at HPHC. 

Record review. The study population consisted of 5042 HPHC 
members who underwent 5572 nonobstetric operative procedures. 
All nonobstetric NNIS categories were represented, plus 1465 pro 
cedures classified as nonoperative. Table 1 presents summary infor 
mation about the patient population and procedure types.

meet CDC criteria for SSI. Screening of automated ambulatory 
encounter, pharmacy, and administrative records identified 741 
procedures. Review of the relevant full-text records for this 
group identified 105 additional SSIs. Agreement between the 
two infectious disease physicians regarding the presence or 
absence of infection exceeded 95%. The overall attack rate for 
SSI was 2.4%; it was 0.7% for predischarge events (among 
inpatients) and 2.0% for postdischarge events. Of the total 132 
SSIs identified, III (84%) occurred after discharge, and 70 
(63%) of these were diagnosed and treated entirely outside of 
the institution at which the surgery was done. The median 
postoperative length of stay for inpatients with a postdischarge 
SSI was 4 days; all occurred among patients with a postopera 
tive length of stay of ~ 14 days. 
There were 53 positive patient responses and 44 positive 
surgeon responses relating to procedures not identified as com 
plicated by an SSI by our methodology. Review of inpatient 
and outpatient records for these patients identified 1 postopera 
tive event meeting criteria for an SSI. This event qualified as 
an SSI on the basis of a physician's diagnosis (in free text 
only, on a single visit) after noting wound erythema, which 
was not treated with antibiotics. The majority of false-positive 
responses from patients represented minor wound complica 
tions that were documented in the ambulatory record but did 
not meet NNIS criteria for SSI. The majority of false-positive 
responses from surgeons related to procedures done on sites 
that were infected preoperatively. 
Figure 2 shows pre- and postdischarge SSI attack rates within 
10 procedure categories, derived from collapsing the more spe 
cific NNIS classification scheme. Attack rates ranged from 0 
(0/204) for neurosurgical procedures to 10.3% (27/261) for 
cardiothoracic procedures. Pre- and postdischarge SSI attack 
rates within these 10 categories and each of the 42 NNIS 
nonobstetric procedure categories are summarized in table 2.

necessitated 37 emergency room visits, 37 hospitalizations, 202 
scheduled clinical appointments at HPHC (mean, 1.8; range, 
0-8),117 home care visits (mean, 1.1; range, 0-20), and 155 
nonappointment encounters (mean, 1.4; range, 0-6), such as 
telephone calls or visits for laboratory tests, that could be veri 
fied as directly attributable to the infection. The average number 
of additional ambulatory or emergency room encounters was 
4.6 (511/111). The 70 procedures that necessitated no SSI 
related rehospitalizations or emergency room visits accounted 
for 147 scheduled clinical appointments, 41 home visits, and 
48 nonappointment encounters verified as attributable to their 
infection. In other words, 50% (236/474) of SSI-related outpa 
tient encounters occurred among patients diagnosed and treated 
without a revisit to the institution where surgery was done. 
These figures are likely to be underestimates, since no attempt 
was made to include services that were partly attributable to 
the infection or services that occurred after the 30th postopera 
tive day. 
Questionnaire information. Questionnaires were mailed to 
patients regarding 5388 procedures. They were not sent to 184 
patients who either had died or were inpatients at the surgical 
facility at the time of the mailing; these 184 included 6 with 
SSIs, 2 of whom had never been discharged and 4 who had been 
readmitted for treatment of their infection. All 5572 procedures 
were represented on the monthly forms sent to surgeons. Patient 
questionnaires were returned for 1799 procedures (33.4%) and 
surgeon questionnaires for 4420 procedures (79%). 
Table 3 shows the results of patient and surgeon responses 
in relation to the actual occurrence of SSI, excluding the 21 
predischarge SSIs. The sensitivity of a positive patient response 
was 28% and the positive predictive value was 36%. The sensi 
tivity of a positive patient response rose to 68% if the unre 
turned questionnaires were excluded. For surgeon question 
naires, if a response of possible SSI was interpreted as negative, 
the sensitivity was 15% and the positive predictive value was 
28%. If possible SSI was considered a positive response, these 
figures were 24% and 19%, respectively. 
Performance characteristics of selected automated screen 
ing criteria. The performance characteristics of separate com 
ponents of our automated screening are shown in figure 3, 
along with the performance of patient and surgeon question 
naires. Coded diagnoses, tests, and treatments in the ambulatory 
medical record identified 84% of infections (93/111), with a 
positive predictive value of 17% (93/533). Dispensing of an 
antibiotic commonly used to treat soft tissue infections was 
next best, with a sensitivity of 50% (56/111) and a positive 
predictive value of 19% (56/289). No other single component 
had a sensitivity >40%. A hospital-based surveillance program 
that reviewed all emergency room visits and hospital readmis 
sions would have had a sensitivity of 39% (43/111) and a

positive predictive value. of 7% (43/622); a program that re 
viewed ICD-9-specific emergency room visits and hospital 
readmissions would have had a sensitivity of 30% (331111) 
and a positive predictive value of 41 % (33/81). 

The pairing of screening of automated records and review 
of selected full-text records was both sensitive and efficient 
for identifying SSI because we retrieved information about 
outpatient care through automated clinical, laboratory, phar 
macy, and administrative data bases; we could review all full 
text records of persons who met screening criteria; and patient 
and surgeon questionnaires identified a negligible number of 
additional infections. 
The percentage of SSIs occurring after hospital discharge 
was high (84%), reflecting in part the inclusion of procedures 
done in the ambulatory setting or with a very short stay in the 
hospital. However, even for major surgical procedures (e.g., 
cardiac surgery), the majority of SSIs occurred after discharge.

Figure 3. Strategies for screening for postdischarge SSIs. Plot shows sensitivity (x-axis) and positive predictive value (y-axis) of seven 
candidate methodologies. Numbers in parentheses show number of true-positive, false-positive, and false-negative responses, respectively, for 
given methodology. All points are based on III postdischarge SSIs occurring among 5551 procedures (21 procedures leading to predischarge 
SSIs were excluded) except "patient questionnaire." Because patient questionnaires were not sent if person was known to be deceased or in 
hospital at time of mailing, this point is based on 107 SSIs occurring among 5388 procedures. 



Furthennore, the majority (63%) of the 84% of SSIs that oc 
curred after hospital discharge were diagnosed and treated en 
tirely in the ambulatory setting. In this cohort, if the institution 
had identified every predischarge SSI and every postdischarge 
SSI leading to a rehospitalization or emergency room visit, the 
recognized SSI attack rate would have been 1.1% (62/5572), 
while the actual attack rate was 2.4% (132/5572). 
These postdischarge SSIs were associated with important 
resource utilization. There were on average 4.6 outpatient en 
counters attributable to the SSI and a substantial number of 
emergency room visits and rehospitalizations. There were a 
significant number of additional outpatient visits even among 
the 70 postdischarge SSIs that did not lead to an emergency 
room visit or rehospitalization: 236 encounters, or an average 
of 3.4 encounters/SSI for this group. This is a minimal estimate 
of resource utilization, as only those events occurring within 
30 postoperative days and verified as primarily relating to the 
SSI were included. More accurate assessment of the resource 
utilization associated with these infections will require assess 
ment of total utilization for those with and without infection, 
while controlling for important potential sources of bias. 
The patient and surgeon questionnaires used in this study 
proved to have both low sensitivity and positive predictive 
value for detection of true SSIs. Patient questionnaires were 
Insensitive largely because of the return rate of only 33.4%, a 
proportion similar to previous studies using a single mailed 
questionnaire [21]. On the other hand, surgeon questionnaires 
had a high return rate but were even less sensitive than patient 
questionnaires because many responses were falsely negative. 
Potential reasons for the poor sensitivity of surgeon question 
naires include lack of awareness of postdischarge infections 
(because postoperative follow-up was delivered by a different 
provider) or failure to remember such infections by the time 
they received the fonn. 
The reasons for poor predictive value also differed between 
patient and surgeon responses. For patients, false-positive re 
sponses typically represented minor wound complications not 
meeting criteria for SSI. For surgeons, the majority of false 
positive responses related to reporting of preoperatively infected 
sites, despite the fact that questionnaires included a cover letter 
explaining that only postoperative events should be reported. 
The poor perfonnance of patient and surgeon questionnaires 
(as a one-time mailing) highlights the need for further investi 
gation of methods of postdischarge surgical site surveillance. 
The usefulness of patient questionnaires might be improved by 
strategies to improve the return rate, such as multiple mailings, 
telephone contacts, or discussing the questionnaire before dis 
charge. For surgeons, other strategies would be necessary, since 
their response rate was satisfactory. The impact ofthese maneu 
vers is not known, but questionnaire perfonnance would have 
to be dramatically better than the current findings to be a useful 
and efficient method for routine surveillance. 
The current study used a case-finding method designed for 
maximal sensitivity at the expense of requiring full-text review 
of > 10% of records. Future studies should focus on the meth 
odology or combination of methodologies that provides the 
best combination of sensitivity and efficiency. We found that 
review of automated data bases was extremely useful as a 
screening methodology for SSIs. While there are currently few 
institutions with access to entirely automated records, these are 
likely to become increasingly available. An efficient mecha 
nism for capturing emergency room visits and rehospitaliza 
tions, ideally in association with coded diagnoses, would allow 
a hospital to capture 39% of postdischarge SSIs. Screening 
outpatient antibiotic prescriptions may also be worthwhile. It 
should also be noted that postdischarge SSI rates varied dramat 
ically among NNIS procedure categories. More than 75% of 
postdischarge SSIs fell within 17 NNIS categories, representing 
<50% of procedures. An efficient surveillance program may 
choose to focus surveillance on certain procedure groups, per 
haps tailored to the case mix at that institution. Limiting surveil 
lance to those with a postoperative length of stay of < 14 days 
(the longest postoperative length of stay for which a postdis 
charge SSI was detected) would not have been an effective 
method since it would have eliminated the need for surveillance 
for only 5% of our population. Except for the few procedures 
with a postoperative length of stay of> 14 days, the distribution. 
of postoperative length of stay was very similar for procedures 
with and without an associated postdischarge SSI, including 
an identical median of 4 days. 
Our overall SSI attack rate is lower than most previously 
published attack rates for SSIs [3, 5,10,12-14,22-26]. There 
may be several reasons for this. First, the population included 
low anesthesiology risk 
many low-risk procedures (clean, 
scores, brief duration). Many were ambulatory procedures that 
have not been carefully studied before this (including > 25% 
categorized as nonoperative by the NNIS classification 
scheme). Second, our protocol required written documentation 
of findings meeting the CDC definition of SSI. Events oc 
curring after 30 days were not included and, unlike some stud 
ies [26], antibiotic treatment alone for a wound complication 
did not meet diagnostic criteria. Nonetheless, there was sub 
stantial infection-related morbidity and resource utilization. Fi 
nally, it is possible that our surveillance failed to detect a 
significant number of SSIs. We think this unlikely for reasons 
stated above, but in lieu of a true reference standard, estimates 
of the number of infections should be understood to be lower 
bounds and sensitivity measures as upper bounds. 
We conclude that the majority of SSIs occur after hospital 
discharge and that these infections are associated with im 
portant morbidity and resource utilization. Identification of 
SSIs will require that hospitals, managed care organizations, 
and insurers perfonn some fonn of postdischarge surveillance. 
This investigation has demonstrated the considerable disadvan 
tages of mailed questionnaires, which are both less accurate 
(lower sensitivity and lower specificity) and more resource 
intensive than use of automated administrative and patient care 
data, which are becoming increasingly available. Additional 



effort is warranted to identify optimally efficient screening and 
confirmation methods and to better define the risk factors for 
postdischarge SSIs that might allow for a surveillance strategy 
that focuses on high-risk groups.
