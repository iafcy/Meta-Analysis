TABLE 1. CDC definition of deep and superficial surgical site infection
Superficial incisional SSI is an infection that occurs within 30 days after the operation and the infection involves only skin or subcutaneous
tissue of the incision and at least one of the following:
• Purulent drainage, with or without laboratory confirmation, from the superficial incision.
• Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the superficial incision.
• At least one of the following signs or symptoms of infection: pain or tenderness, localized swelling, redness, or heat AND superficial incision
is deliberately opened by the surgeon, unless incision is culture negative.
• Diagnosis of superficial incisional SSI by the surgeon or attending physician.
Do not report the following conditions as SSI:
• Stitch abscess (minimal inflammation and discharge confined to the points of suture penetration).
• Infected burn wound.
• Incisional SSI that extends into the fascial and muscle layers (see deep incisional SSI).
Deep infection occurs within 30 days and the infection appears to be related to the operation and infection involved deep soft tissues (eg,
fascial and muscle layers) of the incision and at least one of the following:
• Purulent drainage from the deep incision but not from the organ/space component of the surgical site.
• A deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon when the patient has at least one of the following signs or
symptoms: fever (>38°C), localized pain, or tenderness, unless site is culture negative.
• An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision is found on direct examination, during reoperation, or by
histopathologic or radiologic examination.
• Diagnosis of a deep incision SSI by a surgeon or attending physician.
Note:
• Infection that involves both superficial and deep incision sites is reported as deep incisional SSI.
• An organ/space SSI that drains through the incision is reported as a deep incisional SSI.

DISCUSSION
the current study demonstrates relatively poor interra-
ter reliability among 3 attending surgeons in identifying
ssi according to CDC criteria, particularly in patients
with obesity. Compared with our previous study, which
relied on documentation in the emR, the addition of pho-
tographic data in the current study indicates that these
surgeons, despite looking at the same wound, could not
reliably agree on the presence of an ssi.
Clinical Implications
the potential discrepancy in accurately defining ssi has sig-
nificant implications. these findings could explain the wide
variability reported in the literature with regard to ssi fol-
lowing colorectal surgery. however, it also highlights the lim-
itations inherent to using institutional ssi rates as a reliable
marker of quality. increasingly, deep and organ space ssis
to a greater extent than superficial ssis following colorectal
surgery are tied to quality. Centers for medicare & medicaid
services requires hospitals to report deep and organ space
