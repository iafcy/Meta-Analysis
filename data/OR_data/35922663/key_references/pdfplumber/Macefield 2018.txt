Methods: Patients completed the WHQ (self-assessment) within 30days after leaving hospital
and returned it by post. Healthcare professionals completed the WHQ (observer assessment) by tele-
phone or face-to-face. Questionnaire response rates and patient acceptability were assessed. Factor

A total of 44 of 50 participants (88 per cent) included
in the test‚Äìretest sample (who all reported stable health)
completed and returned a second WHQ. The median
time between test‚Äìretest assessments was 5 (i.q.r. 4‚Äì7)
days. Agreement in responses for test‚Äìretest assess-
ments was high, with levels of observed agreement
greater than 86‚ãÖ2 per cent for all items (TableS2, sup-
porting information). Where it was possible to calculate
a reliable Œ∫ statistic, the majority of values were greater
than0‚ãÖ59.
Inter-raterreliability
Self- and observer assessments were available for 59‚ãÖ4
per cent of participants, with a median of 8 (i.q.r. 2‚Äì16)
days between assessments. Agreement was generally
high (observed agreement for any item greater than
84‚ãÖ3 per cent), although participants showed a trend
to report levels of signs and symptoms to be slightly
more severe than observers; an example from one item
is shown in Fig.2 (for data from all items, see Fig.S1,
supporting information). Where it was possible to cal-
culate a reliable Œ∫ statistic, values were between 0‚ãÖ40
and 0‚ãÖ74 for the majority of items (TableS3, support-

Validity
Reference SSI diagnoses (face-to-face, using CDC
criteria) were available for 417 of 791 participants
(52‚ãÖ7 per cent). Sensitivity and specificity values of the
WHQ self-assessment for discriminating between SSI
and no SSI were high, with an area under the ROC
curve of 0‚ãÖ91 (95 per cent c.i. 0‚ãÖ83 to 0‚ãÖ98) (Fig.3).
Cross-tabulation of the self-assessment WHQ total score
(excluding item 4a) with the reference SSI diagnosis is
provided in TableS4 (supporting information). Sensitivity
and specificity values for selected WHQ cut-off scores
areshowninTableS5(supportinginformation).Fromthe
present data set, a cut-off score of 6‚Äì8 appeared to be
a reasonable threshold for suggesting no SSI/SSI com-
pared with the reference diagnosis, with relatively few
misclassifications.
Modificationsforthefinalquestionnaire
Evidence supported the need for minor revisions to the
WHQ format to improve its efficiency and minimize
missing data. Item 3 and its additional components col-
