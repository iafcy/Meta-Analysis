Abstract
Background: We aimed to develop and validate a screening algorithm to assist community health workers
(CHWs) in identifying surgical site infections (SSIs) after cesarean section (c-section) in rural Africa.
Methods: Patients were adult women who underwent c-section at a Rwandan rural district hospital between
MarchandOctober2017.ACHWadministeredanine-itemclinicalquestionnaire10–3dayspost-operatively.
Independently, a general practitioner (GP) administered the same questionnaire and assessed SSI presence by
physical examination. The GP’s SSI diagnosis was used as the gold standard. Using a simplified Classification
and Regression Tree analysis, we identified a subset of screening questions with maximum sensitivity for the
GP and CHW and evaluated the subset’s sensitivity and specificity in a validation dataset. Then, we compared
the subset’s results when implemented in the community by CHWs with health center-reported SSI.
Results: Of the 596 women enrolled, 525 (88.1%) completed the clinical questionnaire. The combination of
questions concerning fever, pain, and discolored drainage maximized sensitivity for both the GPs (sensitiv-
ity=96.8%;specificity=85.6%)andCHWs(sensitivity=87.1%;specificity=73.8%).Inthevalidationdataset,this
subsethadsensitivityof95.2%andspecificityof83.3%fortheGP-administeredquestionsandsensitivityof76.2%
and specificity of 81.4% for the CHW-administered questions. In the community screening, the overall percent
agreement between CHW and health center diagnoses was 81.1% (95% confidence interval: 77.2%–84.6%).
Conclusions: We identified a subset of questions that had good predictive features for SSI, but its sensitivity
was lower when administered by CHWs in a clinical setting, and it performed poorly in the community.
Methods to improve diagnostic ability, including training or telemedicine, must be explored.
