45 Abstract:
46 INTRODUCTION: Post-surgical discharge complications result in increased hospital
47 readmissions, cost, and patient dissatisfaction. Telehealth technology to monitor patients,
T
48 especially those in geographically isolated areas, may reduce post-operative complications,
P
49 improve health and financial outcomes.
I
R
50 OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to compare outcomes between patients that received
C
51 Telehealth electronic monitoring (THEM) to those with routine discharge instructions and no
S
52 monitoring, Standard Of Care (SOC).
U
53 METHODS: This was a prospective randomized study of vascular surgery patients with infra-
N
54 inguinal incisions. THEM patients received a tablet and home monitoring devices that
A
55 transmitted information to care managers. Monitoring tools included image capture, weight
M
56 scales, blood pressure cuffs, thermometers and oxygen saturation monitors. Care managers used
D
57 the TeleMed 2020 Enform™ platform to review alerts, real-time patient data, and dialogue with
58 the care team. E
T
59 RESULTS: Eighty patients were screened and thirty enrolled, of which 16 (53.3%) were
P
60 randomized to the THEM and 14 (46.7%) control groups. Average age and BMI for THEM and
E
61 control patients were similar (62.5 + 7.2 vs 65.7 + 7.3, p=0.234; and 27.7 + 4.3 vs 29.1 7.1,
C
62 p=0.487), respectively. There was a similar number of male participants in each group (THEM
C
63 62.5% versus SOC 42.9%, p=0.464). There were no significant differences in wound or 30-day
A
64 readmissions (THEM 6.3% vs SOC 7.1%, p=1.000). Interestingly, 30-day infection rates
65 indicated care managers identified marginally more superficial wound problems in the THEM
66 group (31.3% vs 7.1%, p=0.175). Both groups reported an increase in SF8 physical summary
67 scores, but was more pronounced in THEM patients (p=0.076). THEM patients reported a
3
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
68 significantly greater improvement in quality of life on three of the SF8 quality subscales
69 (Physical function, Role-Physical and Role-Emotional; THEM ∆ 7.5 vs Control ∆ 1.1; THEM ∆
70 8.7 vs Control ∆ 1.1; and THEM ∆ 6.3 Control ∆ -0.5; all p<0.05). THEM patients reported
T
71 trends for higher satisfaction in terms of general satisfaction, technical quality and accessibility
P
72 for PSQ18 survey questions (4.2 vs 3.7,p=0.072; 4.5 vs 4.1, p=0.081; and 4.2 vs 3.8, p=0.063),
I
R
73 respectively.
C
74 Conclusion: THEM was technically feasible and provided some benefit to patients in
S
75 geographically disparate areas. THEM was associated with increased patient satisfaction.
U
76 Additional findings suggested THEM patients embraced telehealth technology and took
N
77 advantage of increased access to health care professionals. Telehealth successfully merged
A
78 remotely generated information with care manager interaction. Presently, a larger study,
M
79 preferably multicenter, is warranted and under consideration.

92 Introduction:
93 Modern telehealth utilization has evolved from using the telephone in the 1870’s to reduce
94 unnecessary office visits to using tablets or other devices to transmit voice, survey questions,
T
95 email or text messages, images, and videos with or without conferencing.1-3 Telehealth
P
96 continues to progress and has grown into a larger domain in patient care that combines both
I
R
97 telecommunications and information technologies. This digital approach has the potential to
C
98 provide continuous remote medical care access to different aspects of patient care from different
S
99 geographical locations for extended periods of time. The scope of telehealth communication
U
100 may range from simple activities such as telephone consultation to more sophisticated
N
101 technology as tele- or robotic surgery.2 Feasibility of these approaches has been previously
A
102 evaluated.3-6 In one study, it was determined that there were no diagnostic errors made using
M
103 remote telemedicine compared to in-person clinic follow-up. 7 Ironically, vascular
D
104 interventionists, although currently practicing in highly technologically-laden environments,
105 have limited use of modern telehealth apEproaches. Most large care centers and specialty
T
106 physicians are located in metropolitan areas requiring patients to travel significant distances for
P
107 simple office visits. Further, for a myriad of reasons, areas of the country remain relatively
E
108 geographically isolated. Telehealth Electronic Monitoring (THEM) has emerged as a valid
C
109 option to access and monitor patients within different levels of their healthcare. Telehealth is a
C
110 vector that allows the transfer of information from the patient to the provider or vice versa.
A
111 Indeed, THEM technology can decrease the burden placed on medical resources, increase the
112 efficacy of health care and increase the time efficiency for both patients and physicians. Yet, a
113 more comprehensive approach that includes patient satisfaction surveys and bio-sensors is
114 needed to better define the utilization and role of telehealth for surgical and other vascular
5

115 interventions. The current prospective randomized controlled study was designed to evaluate
116 clinical outcomes, utilization, feasibility, patient satisfaction and quality of life for patients using
117 THEM after cut-down infra-inguinal incision (i.e., dissection of a vein or artery for insertion of a
T
118 cannula or needle) for any vascular procedure.

122 The specific details of the current study design have previously been reported. 8 Briefly, it was a
U
123 prospective, randomized, open-label, single-center with blinded endpoints (PROBE) designed
N
124 study.9 The primary objective of the current project was to compare outcomes for patients who
A
125 received post discharge health care monitoring (which includes using Telehealth electronic
M
126 monitoring; THEM) to patients who receive standard of care (SOC), which included routine
D
127 discharge instructions with no telehealth monitoring. The primary outcomes included 30-day
128 readmissions and deep surgical site infeEctions. Secondary outcomes included pre and post-
T
129 surgery quality of life measures (SF-8), patient satisfaction, superficial surgical site infection, in-
P
130 home visits from visiting nurse service (VNS), and an occurrence of any 30-day stroke,
E
131 myocardial infarction or death. The study had three main hypotheses: 1) A smaller percentage of
C
132 THEM patients would require a 30-day unplanned readmission compared to patients who
C
133 received standard of care (SOC). 2) A smaller percentage of THEM patients would develop
A
134 deep SSIs (i.e., infections involving fascia and/or muscular layers requiring wound interventions
135 such as opening, debridement, etc.) compared to SOC. 3) THEM patients would report greater
136 post discharge satisfaction and higher quality of life measures than SOC patients.

138 Patients in the intervention group (THEM) received a tablet computer with the Enform® App and
139 set of medical devices for home monitoring. Medical devices included weight scales, blood
140 pressure cuffs, thermometer and oxygen saturation monitors. Each participant randomized to the
T
141 THEM arm was provided a take-home kit. The kit contained (Samsung Galaxy Tab E 8” inch

146 reviewed by care managers using the web enabled Enform® clinician portal. Clinical care
N
147 managers were both registered nurses with over 30 years of experience. Each had experience
A
148 in ambulatory cardiovascular nursing, and remotely monitored the patients using this tool
M
149 daily. Clinical care managers engaged with patients by phone or used the integrated Enform®
D
150 messaging based on alerts and/or data generated by the telehealth monitoring system.
E
151 Participants were instructed to monitor the tablets daily, perform their measurements (i.e., blood
T
152 pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, weight and temperature) and answer daily plus weekly
P
153 quiz questions. (Table 1) The care manager logged into the TeleMed2020 website and
E
154 monitored values daily, however, the care manager only initiated contact with participants by
C
155 phone or internal messaging if there was a concern generated by any of the system alerts.
C
156 Patients, however, were able to contact their care manager at any time.

157 Based on data collected, the care manager requested the patient take a picture of the surgical site
158 for assessment and comparison with previously collected images. All images as well as other
159 information such as, system alerts or aberrant results, when persistent, were shared with the
160 medical director to proactively manage the patients in between in-person visits. The care

161 management team established the following thresholds for bio-sensor system alerts: high systolic
162 (>150 mmHG), low systolic (<90 mmHG), high diastolic (>90 mmHG), low systolic (<50
163 mmHG), high pulse (>100 BPM), low pulse (<60 BPM), low oxygen saturation (<90%), weight

276 In addition, and not counting some inadvertent shutter pushes, THEM patients took 141
277 photographs (mean 8.8 + SD; range 0-27 9.7) to be shared with the care management team. Four
278 patients in the THEM arm had superficial wound infections that were treated without the need
T
279 for an emergency room visit or an unscheduled office visit. Anecdotally, these patients told the
P
280 care managers that they were very satisfied to take photographs and have them reviewed by a
I
R
281 physician. Subsequently, the physician called in prescriptions for antibiotics to the patients’
C
282 local pharmacies. Interestingly, patients that took photographs indicating no infection were also
S
283 anecdotally pleased to receive reassurance from a physician. One patient in THEM with a deep
U
284 wound infection was a redo-surgery for a graft wound infection, and in retrospect, current wound
N
285 infection should have been part of our exclusion criteria. Another patient in THEM had a
A
286 chronic non-healing wound. However, he had a closed bypass graft. Ultimately, three patients
M
287 in THEM were sent to the hospital for emergency room visits, but their visits can be explained
D
288 by clinical conditions that were not associated with the cut down procedure or infection. One
289 was admitted with the deep wound infecEtion (i.e., mentioned above), one with pulmonary
T
290 embolism and the other had a non-wound related problem (urinary retention) and suspected deep
P
291 vein thrombosis which was ruled out by non-invasive duplex ultrasound testing.

C
293 THEM patients had phone and electronic access to a care manager 7 days a week. The majority

295 managers scheduled follow-up appointments, answered post-discharge questions, procured
296 prescriptions and consequently provided direct access to the care management team. THEM
297 patients became involved in monitoring their own bio-markers. This is evidenced by their

299 question, “During the past week, would you say that information you provided to your Care
300 Manager(s) via Enform™ enriched the conversation or quality of care provided?” most
301 respondents (27/33 = 82%) selected “Definitely yes.” In addition, there were several anecdotal
T
302 comments made to the care managers that also support this belief. For example, one patient

N
308 Many researchers have evaluated utilization of THEM in several evolving aspects of vascular
A
309 surgery. Chisci et al evaluated a THEM consultation model for planning and treatment of
M
310 complex thoracoabdominal aortic disease (TAAD) and concluded that THEM may allow
D
311 inexperienced surgeon to acquire and share knowledge from experienced surgeons at larger
312 institutions.13 Another important aspectE of using THEM in postoperative wound care is the
T
313 potential to facilitate transition of care and to decrease readmission for surgical site infections. 14
P
314 We found no significant differences in wound or 30-day readmissions (6.3% versus 7.1%,
E
315 p=1.000; and 25.0% versus 14.3%, p=0.657). However, the central reason for not detecting any
C
316 significant difference between groups was likely due to our low enrollment numbers, which will
C
317 be discussed below.

318
319 Despite our lack of a primary statistically significant finding, we found several instances where
320 our results suggested the benefit of using THEM and increased quality of life and patient

322 scores (p=0.076). In addition, THEM patients had more pronounced effects for three of the
323 subscales as well (i.e., physical function, physical role and mental health; all interactions <0.05).
324 Besides quality of life measures, there was some evidence for THEM patients being more
T
325 satisfied with their health care. We found marginal trends for THEM patients to have more
P
326 general satisfaction, rate technical quality and accessibility higher (p values ranged from 0.063 –
I
R
327 0.081). As compared to others, 1-3, 6, 15 the current study went beyond a feasibility type of study
C
328 and provided real world evidence that suggests patients will adopt and accept remote monitoring.
S
329 THEM patients rated remote monitoring and medical device technology as easy to use and
U
330 believed that their efforts enriched the quality of care that they received.
N
331
A
332 There are many potential uses for telehealth communications including reaching out to
M
333 communities in underserved areas, achieving better quality of patient care, avoiding
D
334 hospitalization, producing cost savings, improving surgeons’ experience, providing an
335 opportunity for international consultatioEn to underdeveloped countries and expansion of medical
T
336 knowledge and techniques among health professionals. 1 In our study, THEM patients lived an
P
337 average of 60.2 miles from the vascular care center with some 31.3% more than 77 miles
E
338 requiring a two to three hour drive. The patients that received call-in prescriptions were very
C
339 satisfied and grateful for the continuity of care and were glad that they did not have to make a
C
340 trip back to the vascular center.
A
341
342 In the current study, care managers used system alerts and wound pictures to determine whether
343 a consultation with the medical director was necessary. Even though it was of secondary interest,
344 we found patients to be appreciative of the direct connection to the care management team and
15
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
345 took advantage of this opportunity by having the care managers to schedule follow-up
346 appointments, answer post-discharge questions and help procure prescription medications.
347 Although somewhat underutilized 7, THEM can be used as a useful tool to minimize the costs
T
348 and challenges for postoperative vascular patients. Endean et al 3 reported the efficacy and
P
349 accuracy of THEM, and concluded that the evaluation of vascular patients is accurate and as
I
R
350 effective as on-site evaluations for a variety of vascular problems. Yet, important adjuncts
C
351 enhance the success of the evaluation are physician experience with the technology and the
S
352 presence of a knowledgeable on-site assistant. This technology can be easily adapted to other
U
353 clinical situations.
N
354
A
355 Another important aspect of THEM is the potential to improve quality of care in both outpatient
M
356 and inpatient wound care along with decreased medical cost and hospital resources by allowing
D
357 home care nurses to electronically transmit images of patients' wounds to treating surgeons. In
358 our study, nurse care mangers were ableE to have uninterrupted access to the condition of the
T
359 patient’s wounds and maintained uninterrupted access to a supervising physician 24/7. Likewise,
P
360 THEM patients had phone and electronic access to a care manager 7 days a week. THEM
E
361 patients rated the technology as easy to use and believed these efforts impacted their health care.
C
362 Often care managers served as the direct connection to the health care system by scheduling
C
363 follow-up appointments, answering post-discharge questions and helping to procure prescriptions
A
364
365 In another vascular surgery study2, the authors concluded that wound evaluation on the basis of
366 viewing digital images is comparable with standard wound examination and renders similar
367 diagnoses and treatment in the majority of cases. In our study, THEM patients took 141
16
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
368 photographs all of which were shared with the care management physician. Four of these photos
369 contained elements of superficial wound infections, all of which were treated by calling in a
370 prescription to a local pharmacy without the need for an emergency room visit or an unscheduled
T
371 office visit. Interestingly, patients were pleased to have their photographs reviewed by a
P
372 physician, whether antibiotic or reassurance of no infection was provided. Although not
I
R
373 measured, the photographic images seemed to be high quality and easily used by the care team to
C
374 make assessments about the patients’ wound conditions. However, it is possible that THEM
S
375 technology provided an extra level of scrutiny which, led to increased or unnecessary diagnosis,
U
376 treatment or prescription medication. With this in mind, we believe that sharing information
N
377 among the care team members served to decrease the possibility of over utilization.
A
378
M
379 Although we found no significant differences for wound or any readmissions, or any of the office
D
380 or home nursing visits, it was noteworthy that three THEM patients were sent to the emergency
381 room. One was admitted with deep wouEnd infection (i.e., the one that was a redo graft
T
382 infection), one for suspected PE and one with urinary retention where suspected DVT was ruled
P
383 out. Thus, we suspect an added benefit of THEM technology is to provide better and continuous
E
384 health care, perhaps avoiding a more complicated septic course or death.
C
385
C
386 Insurance companies are beginning to reimburse patients and providers for telehealth services,
A
387 which should help to drive health care costs down.16, 17 On the other hand, THEM technology
388 carries potential concerns such as availability of internet service, cost of devices or internet
389 service, ease of usability as some patients are typically not as device-savvy (e.g., as the newer
390 generation), privacy of information according to HIPAA, concerns on scams from internet and a
17
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
391 general right to privacy. Therefore, at a minimum, we recommend these issues to be considered
392 thoroughly by the hospital’s legal and information technology teams in order to provide the best
393 options for patients.
T
394
P
395 Limitations:
I
R
396
C
397 A major limitation of the findings for the current research study was sample size. There were
S
398 several reasons for the lower than planned enrollment number. First, funding was only available
U
399 for one year and thus limited the amount of time for open enrollment. Next, it took some time to
N
400 develop a good method for identifying potential participants and providing them with the
A
401 opportunity to learn about the study. Efforts were made to make contact with the patients during
M
402 their pre-admission testing visit to introduce the general idea of participating in the study, but
D
403 this was not always possible and in some cases contact was not before the procedure. Lastly, and
404 perhaps equally important was the numbEer of patients who refused to participate. Although our
T
405 percentage of refusals was somewhat expected (22/80=27.5%), additional efforts in pre-study
P
406 design could have potentially increased our yield. Nine of the 22 patients who refused did so
E
407 because of apprehension to the technology. Perhaps a 10-15 minute video describing the study
C
408 could have reduced some of the apprehension about the technological aspects of the study.
C
409
A
410 Conclusion:
411
412 THEM was technically feasible and provided some benefit to patients in geographically disparate
413 areas. THEM was associated with increased patient satisfaction. Additional findings suggested
18
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
414 THEM patients embraced telehealth technology and took advantage of increased access to health
415 care professionals. Telehealth successfully merged remotely generated information with care
416 manager interaction. Presently, a larger study, preferably multicenter, is warranted.
