There is substantial interest in the use of patient-reported
symptoms14 and wound images5,7 for the purposes of remote
diagnosis of SSI, although their relative value in the clinical
evaluation was previously unclear. The high specificity combined

ity, the use of patient-reported symptoms alone successfully
classified 82.6% (n=276/334) of responses as not requiring
clinical assessment, with no false negatives. However, as patient-
reported symptoms are known to have high sensitivity for SSI14,
thereremainsthepotentialiatrogenicharmduetooverdiagnosis
of infections that would otherwise self-resolve. A large-scale,
multicentre trial would be required to detect differences in the
severity or Clavien-Dindo grade associated with SSI, however,
there were no significant differences were observed on these
measures (Supplementary Table 2). Together with an overall SSI
rate consistent with previous national estimates17, this does
provide evidence suggesting that there was no clear Hawthorne
effect12 or measurement bias leading to an overdiagnosis of
clinicallyinsignificant surgical-site infections withinTWIST.
Theincorporationofwoundimagestotheassessmentprocess
offered a clinically significant benefit to the specificity and
demonstrated a high rate of concordance (85.6%) with patient-
reported symptoms. While just 1% (n=3/307) of wound images
were rated as “no concerns” despite a clinical diagnosis of SSI
within the following 48h, this nonetheless represented 42.9%
(n=3/7) of all infections. Whilst this remains consistent with

with inter-rater disagreement observed between “gold-standard”

recognised that particularly organ-space SSI may not have any
associated visual evidence, further complicating their remote
diagnosis. There is currently sparce evidence regarding the
minimally acceptable criteria for patients and healthcare teams
regarding the diagnostic accuracy of digital health interventions,
withfewimplemented inroutine clinicalpractice.
TWIST is a pragmatic clinical trial providing evidence of the
effectiveness of this digital health intervention on postoperative
care and incorporates assessment of the wider implications on
health service delivery. Emergency abdominal surgery represents
an initial use-case given the higher rates of SSI, but there are
