Abstract
Background: Surgical site infection(SSI) is a common post-operative complication causing significant morbidity
and mortality. Many SSIoccurafter discharge from hospital. Post-discharge SSI surveillance in low and middle
income countries needsto be improved.
Methodology: We conductedan observational cohort study in Dodoma, Tanzania to examinethe sensitivity and
specificityoftelephonecallstodetectSSIafterdischargefromhospitalincomparisontoagoldstandardofclinician
