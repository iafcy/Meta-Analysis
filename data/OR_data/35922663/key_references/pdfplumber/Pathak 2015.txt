ETHICAL STATEMENT AND DATA MANAGEMENT
The Ethical Committee of Ruxmaniben Deepchand Gardi
Medical College approved the study (approval number 114/
2010). Informed verbal consent was obtained from all study
participantspriortoenrollment.
EpiDataversion3.1software(EpiDataAssociation,Odense,
Denmark) was used for data entry, and STATA version 12.0
software (StataCorp, College Station, TX) was used for data
processingandanalysis.Descriptivestatisticswerecalculated.
The SSI rate was calculated with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs),andavalueofp<0.05wasconsideredsignificant.
