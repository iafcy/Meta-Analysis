OF INFECTIONS THAT DEVELOP AFTER HOSPITAL DISCHARGE

Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate two methods of post-discharge surgical wound surveillance and to compare the
incidence and outcomes of wound infections that develop prior to patients’ discharge with those that develop after hospital discharge.
Methods: One thousand, three hundred and sixty inpatients who underwent major elective surgery in an 800-bed teaching hospital in
western Sydney between February 1996 and July 1997 were followed prospectively. Pre-discharge wound surveillance was performed
by clinical assessment by an independent researcher on the fifth (or later) postoperative day. Post-discharge wound surveillance was
performed by a mail out of questionnaires completed independently by patients and surgeons.
Results: Overall, 138 wound infections were diagnosed (incidence 10.1%), of which fewer than one-third (n= 44) were diagnosed before
discharge (average 10.4 days postoperatively) and the remainder (n = 94) after discharge (average 20.6 days postoperatively).
Seven hundred and eighty-two (57.5%) post-discharge survey forms were returned by patients and 680 (50.0%) by surgeons.
When forms were returned by both surgeons and patients for the same wound (641 cases), there was substantial agreement in diag-
nosing infection or no infection (kappa = 0.73).
Conclusions: The majority of nosocomial surgical wound infections develop after the patients’ discharge from hospital. A post-discharge
surveillance programme including self-reporting of infections by patients and return of questionnaires by patients and surgeons is feasible
in an Australian hospital setting. However, such a programme is labour and resource intensive and strategies to increase return of
questionnaires are required.
