Abstract
Background Availability of surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance rates challenges clinicians, healthcare admin-
istrators and leaders and the public. The purpose of this report is to demonstrate the consequences patient self-
assessment strategies have on SSI reporting rates.
Methods We performed SSI surveillance among patients undergoing general surgery procedures, including tele-
phonefollow-up30 daysaftersurgery.Additionallyweundertookaseparatevalidationstudyinwhichwecompared
patientself-assessmentsofSSIwithsurgeonassessment.Finally,weperformedameta-analysisofsimilarvalidation
studies of patient self-assessment strategies.
Results There were 22/266 in-hospital SSIs diagnosed (8.3%), and additional 16 cases were detected through the
30-day follow-up. In total, the SSI rate was 16.8% (95% CI 10.1–18.5). In the validation survey, we found patient
telephone surveillance to have a sensitivity of 66% (95% CI 40–93%) and a specificity of 90% (95% CI 86–94%).
The meta-analysis included five additional studies. The overall sensitivity was 83.3% (95% CI 79–88%), and the
overallspecificitywas97.4%(95%CI97–98%).Simulationofthemeta-analysisresultsdivulgedthatwhenthetrue
infection rate is 1%, reported rates would be 4%; a true rate of 50%, the reported rates would be 43%.
Conclusion Patient self-assessment strategies in order to fulfill 30-day SSI surveillance misestimate SSI rates and
leadtoanerroneousoverallappreciationofinter-institutionalvariation.Self-assessmentstrategiesoverestimateSSIs
