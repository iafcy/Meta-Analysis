Specialist wound care to help rebuild
the lives of those injured in confl ict
Woundcare4Heroes was launched to develop a national network of
complex wound management services. These services assist the NHS in
providing lifelong support and care for those discharged from the Armed
Forces. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are designed to infl ict
catastrophic wounds, causing horrifi c, life-changing injuries, which
require long-term, complex wound care.
Woundcare4Heroes aims to provide injured service personnel with
access to specialist wound healing services near to their home. This
enables family and friends to support them through these life-changing
circumstances, with the potential to dramatically improve their wound
healing and, as a result, their life.
