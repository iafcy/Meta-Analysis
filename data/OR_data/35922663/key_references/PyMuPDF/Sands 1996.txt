Although surgical site infections (SSIs) occurring after hospital discharge cause substantial mor-
bidity, their epidemiology is not well understood, and methods for routine postdischarge surveillance
have not been validated. Inpatient and outpatient surveillance followed 5572 nonobstetric procedures
among ll)embers of a health maintenance organization with extensive automated records. Records
were screened for coded diagnoses, tests, and prescriptions and, if positive, were reviewed by reading
full text. Questionnaires regarding the occurrence of an SSI were sent to the same patients and
their surgeons. One hundred thirty-two SSIs were documented, of which 84% occurred after hospital
discharge and 63% were managed outside the surgical facility. Postdischarge SSIs led to an average
of 4.6 additional ambulatory encounters. Patient and surgeon questionnaires had a sensitivity of
28% and 15%, respectively. These data suggest that most SSIs occur after discharge and are not
detectable by conventional surveillance. Nonetheless, they cause substantial resource utilization.
Postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the
leading nosocomial causes of morbidity and increased medical
expense. An estimated 325,000 SSIs occur each year in the
United States and generate additional medical costs in the range
of $1-2 billion [1, 2].
Routine surveillance for SSIs is recommended by both the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [3] and the
Surgical Infection Society [4] as a mechanism for reducing the
rate of these infections, presumably by providing feedback to
surgeons on their performance [4-6]. SSI surveillance has been
associated with decreased infection rates of as much as 35%,
[3, 7] but even if the true effect of surveillance is much less
than this, it would be highly cost-effective: the cost of surveil-
lance has been estimated to be about one-fifth the cost of
treating preventable infections [4, 8]. SSI rates are thus widely
used by hospitals as a quality indicator and as the basis for
quality improvement efforts.
Decreasing hospital lengths of stay and increasing use of
ambulatory surgery may compromise the accuracy of surveil-
lance data [9]. Traditionally, surveillance involved inpatient
follow-up only, but previous studies have reported that as many
as 71% of SSIs occur after hospital discharge [10-16]. For
hospitals to report accurate absolute infection rates or to make

comparisons of rates between hospitals, these infections must
be identified [9, 16]. However, no reliable method for routine
postdischarge wound surveillance has been established. Direct
wound surveillance among outpatients is extremely resource-
intensive, so many hospitals doing postdischarge surveillance
now rely on responses to questionnaires mailed to either pa-
tients or surgeons [17]. To our knowledge, the performance
characteristics of these questionnaires have never been rigor-
ously evaluated. At the same time, there is little published
information about resource utilization associated with postdis-
charge SSIs.
In this study, SSIs occurring before and after discharge were
identified among members of a health maintenance organiza-
tion for whom detailed information was available for all post-
discharge medical encounters and prescriptions.. For the same
cohort, we evaluated the performance of mailed patient and
surgeon questionnaires for detecting postdischarge SSIs and
estimated the resource utilization associated with these infec-
tions.
Methods
Study population.
The study population was drawn from adult
members of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care (HPHC) who underwent
a nonobstetric operating room procedure at Brigham and Women's
Hospital from 10 February 1992 through 7 March 1993. HPHC is
a multimodel health maintenance organization that included a staff
model division with ~300,000 members in the greater Boston area
at the time of this study. Members pay a monthly fee, after which
office visits, urgent care visits, and hospitalizations generate only
nominal charges. At the time of the study, 92% of persons de-
scribed above received care at centers that used an automated
medical record system for both daily charting and archiving; only
members with automated records were included in the study.
The automated medical record system uses standardized forms
that are completed for every patient encounter at HPHC centers,

including telephone calls, office visits (scheduled or unscheduled),
urgent care visits, and hospitalizations. Information is recorded on
forms that are customized for the type of encounter: The provider
either writes in or selects from a list all coded diagnoses, tests,
procedures, and prescriptions relevant to that encounter and enters
additional comments as free text. All information, including free
text, is entered into an automated medical encounter record. The
results of diagnostic tests are entered directly into the automated
record linked to the patient encounter during which they were
ordered. Information about hospitalizations and emergency room
visits appear in both encounter records and separate administrative
records. HPHC pharmacies are also computerized and linked to
the automated medical record. Ninety percent of HPHC members
have prepaid coverage for pharmaceuticals and so are likely to use
HPHC pharmacies for any prescriptions that have more than a
nominal charge at outside pharmacies.
Brigham and Women's Hospital is the most active surgical facil-
ity for greater Boston HPHC members. HPHC patients undergoing
surgery were identified within 3 weeks of their procedure from
the hospital's computerized operating room log, which records
information on every operation in real time, including procedure
date, surgeons involved, duration of the procedure, wound class,
admission status of the patient, and up to three ICD-9 procedure
codes.
Identification ofSSIs.
Hospital-based information about SSIs
was identified by review ofdata gathered by the hospital's infection
control unit, which uses routine microbiology, nurse's notes, and
surgical ward rounds for surveillance, and review of the inpatient
charts ofall patients receiving the ICD-9 code of998.5 (postopera-
tive wound infection) before discharge. Outpatient information
about SSIs was identified by a two-step procedure for reviewing
outpatient records that used the automated record systems de-
scribed above. The first step was a computerized search of three
automated data bases.
Ambulatory encounter records
were
screened for any of 102 diagnostic, testing, or treatment codes that
may have indicated an SSI. A partial list of these codes is given
in figure 1. The pharmacy data base was screened for specific
antibiotic prescriptions, and administrative records were searched
for all rehospitalizations or emergency room visits and their corre-
sponding ICD-9 codes for those potentially indicative of an SSI.
The second step was a physician review of full-text outpatient
records and relevant hospital records for the 30-day postoperative
period for all patients identified by the computerized search.
All records with any documentation suggestive of an SSI were
independently reviewed by 2 infectious disease physicians (K.S.
and R.P.). Final classification as an SSI required agreement that
documentation meeting the 1992 CDC definition of SSI [18] was
present within 30 days of the procedure. For cases in which there
was disagreement, a third independent review was done by a sur-
geon (G.V.), and the majority opinion was accepted. Because pri-
mary outpatient care was often provided by a physician's assistant,
a diagnosis ofSSI made by this provider was considered equivalent
to physician's diagnosis; a physician would have had to review
the diagnosis and findings in these cases ifthey involved prescrip-
tion of an antibiotic.
Assessment ofresource utilization.
Resource utilization asso-
ciated with postdischarge SSI during the 30-day postoperative pe-
riod was explored by review of outpatient records for patients
with a confirmed postdischarge infection. All free-text notes were
reviewed, and encounters for which the principal focus was the
SSI were identified. Other activities associated with the SSI, such
as home care visits, prescriptions, and laboratory tests, were also
identified if there was clear indication that these activities related
directly to the infection.
Patient and surgeon questionnaires.
Patients were mailed a
single-page questionnaire between the 25th and 32nd postoperative
day. A questionnaire was not sent if the patient had died or was
an inpatient (either not discharged or discharged and readmitted)
at the surgical facility during the time window for mailing the
questionnaire. The patient questionnaire appeared in both English
and Spanish and was preaddressed and stamped for return. The
questionnaire provided yes-no checkboxes for questions falling
within three categories: whether the patient had been treated for
any problems during the postoperative period, with "infection at
your surgical incision" as one of the listed choices; whether the
patient had made any urgent or unplanned visits to any health care
facility since the operation; and whether any new medications had
been prescribed since leaving the hospital, with antibiotic listed
as one ofthe choices. While open-ended comments were solicited,
the questionnaire did not focus on the patient's subjective assess-
ment ofthe wound, which has been shown to correlate poorly with
physician findings [19].
Surgeons were mailed a form every 4 weeks that listed their
surgical cases among the study population from 4-8 weeks earlier.
The form displayed patient name, date of the procedure, and type
ofprocedure. Adjacent to the patient name, the surgeon was asked
to indicate whether an SSI occurred, with the possible responses
being "definite," "possible," "no," or "don't know." The form
was sent with a cover letter explaining that responses would not
be used to assess individual surgeon performance and listing the
CDC definition of SSI in abbreviated form. Surgeons were not
notified of the concurrent chart review and patient questionnaire.
Analysis.
Surgical procedures were categorized according to
the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System (NNIS),
which classifies all ICD-9 surgical codes into 44 operative catego-
ries (42 of which are nonobstetric), primarily on the basis of ana-
tomic location of the surgery {20]. Procedures that do not qualify
as operative procedures (for example, needle biopsy, transurethral
prostatectomy) by the NNIS were included in the analysis as a
separate nonoperative category. The NNIS categories were then
collapsed into 10 new categories based on surgical specialty. SSI
rates were calculated for each of the NNIS nonobstetric operative
categories and for each of the 10 larger procedure categories.
Attack rates were calculated for predischarge, postdischarge, and
total events.
Positive questionnaire responses for procedures not identified
as associated with an SSI were investigated by chart review to
determine whether these were false-positive responses or true SSIs
that had been missed by our case-finding methodology.
Performance characteristics of patient and surgeon question-
naires were compared with the record review procedure by calcula-
tion of sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for a
positive questionnaire response. Calculations were made both for
procedures for which a questionnaire was returned and for the
entire population, in which case an unreturned questionnaire was
considered negative.. In addition, for surgeon questionnaires, per-
formance was evaluated by interpreting "possible SSI" first as a
positive response and then as a negative response.

sent actual number of codes used in screening for that
category.
The performance of each separate component of our automated
screening strategy was also evaluated and compared with aggregate
performance and with the results of hospital-based surveillance.
We considered inpatient ICD-9 discharge diagnosis codes; emer-
gency room ICD-9 diagnosis codes; ambulatory care diagnosis,
test, and treatment codes as a group; obtaining wound or blood
~ultures in the ambulatory setting; and dispensing of the 10 princi-
pal oral antibiotic agents used to treat SSIs at HPHC.
Results
Record review.
The study population consisted of5042 HPHC
members who underwent 5572 nonobstetric operative procedures.
All nonobstetric NNIS categories were represented, plus 1465 pro-
cedures classified as nonoperative. Table 1 presents summary infor-
mation about the patient population and procedure types.
Review of inpatient records with an SSI indicated by pro-
spective inpatient surveillance or with discharge coding indicat-
ing an SSI identified 27 events, all of which were confirmed to

meet CDC criteria for SSI. Screening of automated ambulatory
encounter, pharmacy, and administrative records identified 741
procedures. Review of the relevant full-text records for this
group identified 105 additional SSIs. Agreement between the
two infectious disease physicians regarding the presence or
absence of infection exceeded 95%. The overall attack rate for
SSI was 2.4%; it was 0.7% for predischarge events (among
inpatients) and 2.0% for postdischarge events. Of the total 132
SSIs identified, III (84%) occurred after discharge, and 70
(63%) of these were diagnosed and treated entirely outside of
the institution at which the surgery was done. The median
postoperative length of stay for inpatients with a postdischarge
SSI was 4 days; all occurred among patients with a postopera-
tive length of stay of ~ 14 days.
There were 53 positive patient responses and 44 positive
surgeon responses relating to procedures not identified as com-
plicated by an SSI by our methodology. Review of inpatient
and outpatient records for these patients identified 1 postopera-
tive event meeting criteria for an SSI. This event qualified as
an SSI on the basis of a physician's diagnosis (in free text
only, on a single visit) after noting wound erythema, which
was not treated with antibiotics. The majority of false-positive
responses from patients represented minor wound complica-
tions that were documented in the ambulatory record but did
not meet NNIS criteria for SSI. The majority of false-positive
responses from surgeons related to procedures done on sites
that were infected preoperatively.
Figure 2 shows pre- and postdischarge SSI attack rates within
10 procedure categories, derived from collapsing the more spe-
cific NNIS classification scheme. Attack rates ranged from 0
(0/204) for neurosurgical procedures to 10.3% (27/261) for
cardiothoracic procedures. Pre- and postdischarge SSI attack
rates within these 10 categories and each of the 42 NNIS
nonobstetric procedure categories are summarized in table 2.

necessitated 37 emergency room visits, 37 hospitalizations, 202
scheduled clinical appointments at HPHC (mean, 1.8; range,
0-8),117 home care visits (mean, 1.1; range, 0-20), and 155
nonappointment encounters (mean, 1.4; range, 0-6), such as
telephone calls or visits for laboratory tests, that could be veri-
fied as directly attributable to the infection. The average number
of additional ambulatory or emergency room encounters was
4.6 (511/111). The 70 procedures that necessitated no SSI-
related rehospitalizations or emergency room visits accounted
for 147 scheduled clinical appointments, 41 home visits, and
48 nonappointment encounters verified as attributable to their
infection. In other words, 50% (236/474) of SSI-related outpa-
tient encounters occurred among patients diagnosed and treated
without a revisit to the institution where surgery was done.
These figures are likely to be underestimates, since no attempt
was made to include services that were partly attributable to
the infection or services that occurred after the 30th postopera-
tive day.
Questionnaire information.
Questionnaires were mailed to
patients regarding 5388 procedures. They were not sent to 184
patients who either had died or were inpatients at the surgical
facility at the time of the mailing; these 184 included 6 with
SSIs, 2 ofwhom had never been discharged and 4 who had been
readmitted for treatment oftheir infection. All 5572 procedures
were represented on the monthly forms sent to surgeons. Patient
questionnaires were returned for 1799 procedures (33.4%) and
surgeon questionnaires for 4420 procedures (79%).
Table 3 shows the results of patient and surgeon responses
in relation to the actual occurrence of SSI, excluding the 21
predischarge SSIs. The sensitivity ofa positive patient response
was 28% and the positive predictive value was 36%. The sensi-
tivity of a positive patient response rose to 68% if the unre-
turned questionnaires were excluded. For surgeon question-
naires, ifa response ofpossible SSI was interpreted as negative,
the sensitivity was 15% and the positive predictive value was
28%. If possible SSI was considered a positive response, these
figures were 24% and 19%, respectively.
Performance characteristics of selected automated screen-
ing criteria.
The performance characteristics ofseparate com-
ponents of our automated screening are shown in figure 3,
along with the performance of patient and surgeon question-
naires. Coded diagnoses, tests, and treatments in the ambulatory
medical record identified 84% of infections (93/111), with a
positive predictive value of 17% (93/533). Dispensing of an
antibiotic commonly used to treat soft tissue infections was
next best, with a sensitivity of 50% (56/111) and a positive
predictive value of 19% (56/289). No other single component
had a sensitivity >40%. A hospital-based surveillance program
that reviewed all emergency room visits and hospital readmis-
sions would have had a sensitivity of 39% (43/111) and a

positive predictive value. of 7% (43/622); a program that re-
viewed ICD-9-specific emergency room visits and hospital
readmissions would have had a sensitivity of 30% (331111)
and a positive predictive value of 41% (33/81).
Discussion
The pairing of screening of automated records and review
of selected full-text records was both sensitive and efficient
for identifying SSI because we retrieved information about
outpatient care through automated clinical, laboratory, phar-
macy, and administrative data bases; we could review all full-
text records of persons who met screening criteria; and patient
and surgeon questionnaires identified a negligible number of
additional infections.
The percentage of SSIs occurring after hospital discharge
was high (84%), reflecting in part the inclusion of procedures
done in the ambulatory setting or with a very short stay in the
hospital. However, even for major surgical procedures (e.g.,
cardiac surgery), the majority of SSIs occurred after discharge.

Strategies for screening for postdischarge SSIs. Plot shows sensitivity (x-axis) and positive predictive value (y-axis) of seven
candidate methodologies. Numbers in parentheses show number of true-positive, false-positive, and false-negative responses, respectively, for
given methodology. All points are based on III postdischarge SSIs occurring among 5551 procedures (21 procedures leading to predischarge
SSIs were excluded) except "patient questionnaire." Because patient questionnaires were not sent if person was known to be deceased or in
hospital at time of mailing, this point is based on 107 SSIs occurring among 5388 procedures.

Postdischarge Surgical Site Infections
969
Furthennore, the majority (63%) of the 84% of SSIs that oc-
curred after hospital discharge were diagnosed and treated en-
tirely in the ambulatory setting. In this cohort, if the institution
had identified every predischarge SSI and every postdischarge
SSI leading to a rehospitalization or emergency room visit, the
recognized SSI attack rate would have been 1.1% (62/5572),
while the actual attack rate was 2.4% (132/5572).
These postdischarge SSIs were associated with important
resource utilization. There were on average 4.6 outpatient en-
counters attributable to the SSI and a substantial number of
emergency room visits and rehospitalizations. There were a
significant number of additional outpatient visits even among
the 70 postdischarge SSIs that did not lead to an emergency
room visit or rehospitalization: 236 encounters, or an average
of3.4 encounters/SSI for this group. This is a minimal estimate
of resource utilization, as only those events occurring within
30 postoperative days and verified as primarily relating to the
SSI were included. More accurate assessment of the resource
utilization associated with these infections will require assess-
ment of total utilization for those with and without infection,
while controlling for important potential sources of bias.
The patient and surgeon questionnaires used in this study
proved to have both low sensitivity and positive predictive
value for detection of true SSIs. Patient questionnaires were
Insensitive largely because of the return rate of only 33.4%, a
proportion similar to previous studies using a single mailed
questionnaire [21]. On the other hand, surgeon questionnaires
had a high return rate but were even less sensitive than patient
questionnaires because many responses were falsely negative.
Potential reasons for the poor sensitivity of surgeon question-
naires include lack of awareness of postdischarge infections
(because postoperative follow-up was delivered by a different
provider) or failure to remember such infections by the time
they received the fonn.
The reasons for poor predictive value also differed between
patient and surgeon responses. For patients, false-positive re-
sponses typically represented minor wound complications not
meeting criteria for SSI. For surgeons, the majority of false-
positive responses related to reporting ofpreoperatively infected
sites, despite the fact that questionnaires included a cover letter
explaining that only postoperative events should be reported.
The poor perfonnance of patient and surgeon questionnaires
(as a one-time mailing) highlights the need for further investi-
gation of methods of postdischarge surgical site surveillance.
The usefulness ofpatient questionnaires might be improved by
strategies to improve the return rate, such as multiple mailings,
telephone contacts, or discussing the questionnaire before dis-
charge. For surgeons, other strategies would be necessary, since
their response rate was satisfactory. The impact ofthese maneu-
vers is not known, but questionnaire perfonnance would have
to be dramatically better than the current findings to be a useful
and efficient method for routine surveillance.
The current study used a case-finding method designed for
maximal sensitivity at the expense ofrequiring full-text review
of > 10% of records. Future studies should focus on the meth-
odology or combination of methodologies that provides the
best combination of sensitivity and efficiency. We found that
review of automated data bases was extremely useful as a
screening methodology for SSIs. While there are currently few
institutions with access to entirely automated records, these are
likely to become increasingly available. An efficient mecha-
nism for capturing emergency room visits and rehospitaliza-
tions, ideally in association with coded diagnoses, would allow
a hospital to capture 39% of postdischarge SSIs. Screening
outpatient antibiotic prescriptions may also be worthwhile. It
should also be noted that postdischarge SSI rates varied dramat-
ically among NNIS procedure categories. More than 75% of
postdischarge SSIs fell within 17 NNIS categories, representing
<50% of procedures. An efficient surveillance program may
choose to focus surveillance on certain procedure groups, per-
haps tailored to the case mix at that institution. Limiting surveil-
lance to those with a postoperative length of stay of < 14 days
(the longest postoperative length of stay for which a postdis-
charge SSI was detected) would not have been an effective
method since it would have eliminated the need for surveillance
for only 5% of our population. Except for the few procedures
with a postoperative length ofstay of> 14 days, the distribution.
ofpostoperative length of stay was very similar for procedures
with and without an associated postdischarge SSI, including
an identical median of 4 days.
Our overall SSI attack rate is lower than most previously
published attack rates for SSIs [3, 5,10,12-14,22-26]. There
may be several reasons for this. First, the population included
many low-risk procedures (clean, low anesthesiology risk
scores, brief duration). Many were ambulatory procedures that
have not been carefully studied before this (including > 25%
categorized
as
nonoperative by
the
NNIS
classification
scheme). Second, our protocol required written documentation
of findings meeting the CDC definition of SSI. Events oc-
curring after 30 days were not included and, unlike some stud-
ies [26], antibiotic treatment alone for a wound complication
did not meet diagnostic criteria. Nonetheless, there was sub-
stantial infection-related morbidity and resource utilization. Fi-
nally, it is possible that our surveillance failed to detect a
significant number of SSIs. We think this unlikely for reasons
stated above, but in lieu of a true reference standard, estimates
of the number of infections should be understood to be lower
bounds and sensitivity measures as upper bounds.
We conclude that the majority of SSIs occur after hospital
discharge and that these infections are associated with im-
portant morbidity and resource utilization. Identification of
SSIs will require that hospitals, managed care organizations,
and insurers perfonn some fonn ofpostdischarge surveillance.
This investigation has demonstrated the considerable disadvan-
tages of mailed questionnaires, which are both less accurate
(lower sensitivity and lower specificity) and more resource-
intensive than use of automated administrative and patient care
data, which are becoming increasingly available. Additional

effort is warranted to identify optimally efficient screening and
confirmation methods and to better define the risk factors for
postdischarge SSIs that might allow for a surveillance strategy
that focuses on high-risk groups.
