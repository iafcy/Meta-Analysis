Surgical site infections (SSI) cause substantial morbidity and pose a burden to acute healthcare services after surgery. We aimed to
investigate whether a smartphone-delivered wound assessment tool can expedite diagnosis and treatment of SSI after emergency
abdominal surgery. This single-blinded randomised control trial (NCT02704897) enroled adult emergency abdominal surgery
patients in two tertiary care hospitals. Patients were randomised (1:1) to routine postoperative care or additional access to a
smartphone-delivered wound assessment tool for 30-days postoperatively. Patient-reported SSI symptoms and wound photographs
were requested on postoperative days 3, 7, and 15. The primary outcome was time-to-diagnosis of SSI (Centers for Disease Control
deﬁnition). 492 patients were randomised (smartphone intervention: 223; routine care: 269). There was no signiﬁcant difference in
the 30-day SSI rate between trial arms: 21 (9.4%) in smartphone vs 20 (7.4%, p = 0.513) in routine care. Among the smartphone
group, 32.3% (n = 72) did not utilise the tool. There was no signiﬁcant difference in time-to-diagnosis of SSI for patients receiving the
intervention (−2.5 days, 95% CI: −6.6−1.6, p = 0.225). However, patients in the smartphone group had 3.7-times higher odds of
diagnosis within 7 postoperative days (95% CI: 1.02−13.51, p = 0.043). The smartphone group had signiﬁcantly reduced community
care attendance (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.34−0.94, p = 0.030), similar hospital attendance (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.28−1.96, p = 0.577), and
signiﬁcantly better experiences in accessing care (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.17−3.53, p = 0.013). Smartphone-delivered wound follow-up is
feasible following emergency abdominal surgery. This can facilitate triage to the appropriate level of assessment required, allowing
earlier postoperative diagnosis of SSI.

INTRODUCTION
Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common
complications following gastrointestinal surgery1, and increas-
ingly occur after discharge with the move towards earlier patient
discharge2. Early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of SSIs
provide the best opportunities to minimise the associated
burden of disease and promote rationalised antibiotic use.
However, there are substantial clinical challenges due to the
requirement for in-person assessment and the subjective nature
of diagnostic criteria3.
Over three-quarters (78%) of UK adults now own smartphones4,
expanding the potential for digital health interventions. Given the
high frequency of post-operative wound complications, this has
become a research focus in telemedicine5–7. To date, no clinical
trial has been completed to demonstrate the effectiveness or
efﬁcacy of digital health interventions used for the purposes of
remote wound assessment to identify SSI, nor their implications
for patients or the health service. Since the unexpected onset of
the COVID pandemic, the routine use of teleconsultations has now
become a necessary and accepted practice8,9. Remote wound
monitoring poses an immense opportunity to understand and
improve postoperative community care and minimise the burden
of disease for both patients and healthcare services.
This trial aimed to investigate whether a smartphone-delivered
wound assessment tool results in earlier diagnosis and treatment
of SSI after emergency abdominal surgery. Secondary aims
included the evaluation of the impact of this intervention on
healthcare services and patient experience of postoperative care.
RESULTS
Study population
Patients were recruited between 26 July 2016 and 4 March 2020,
and completion of recruitment preceded any known cases of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the local region. There were 717 patients
undergoing emergency abdominal surgery screened for eligibility
during this time (Fig. 1). Of those approached, 11.4% (n = 82)
were excluded due to lacking a smartphone, 13.4% (n = 96)
declined to participate, and 6.4% (n = 46) were discharged prior
to randomisation. Of patients excluded due to lack of a
smartphone, these were signiﬁcantly older (76 years, IQR:
66–84) than other patients screened who did have a smartphone
(47 years, IQR: 32.8–61, p < 0.001).
There were 492 patients recruited to the trial, the majority of
whom underwent major surgical procedures (n = 414, 84.1%), had
a laparoscopic approach (n = 361, 73.4%), and had no uncon-
trolled operative contamination (n = 374, 76.0%). These patients

were randomly assigned to receive either the smartphone
intervention (n = 223) or routine postoperative care (n = 269).
Characteristics showed broadly equal distribution between arms
(Table 1).
Comparison of the smartphone intervention to routine care
Overall, 8.3% (n = 41) of the cohort developed surgical-site
infections (SSI) in the 30-day postoperative period, with no
signiﬁcant difference in the SSI rate between trial arms: 21 (9.4%)
in smartphone and 20 (7.4%) in routine care (OR = 1.29, 95% CI:
0.68−2.45, p = 0.513) (Table 2). The mean time-to-diagnosis was
9.3 days (SD = 6.3) in the smartphone group, and 11.8 days
(SD = 6.7) in the routine care group, which did not demonstrate
a signiﬁcant difference for the primary outcome (−2.5 days, 95%
CI: −6.6–1.6, p = 0.225). Similarly, there was no overall signiﬁcant
difference
in
the
time-to-diagnosis
between
trial
arms
(p = 0.340) (Fig. 2a).
On visualisation (Fig. 2b), a bimodal distribution in the
smartphone group was observed with grouping around the 7
and 15 days (coinciding with scheduled requests for routine
completion). Furthermore, no concerns were identiﬁed on routine
responses at 3 and 7 days in patients with a later SSI diagnosis in
the smartphone arm. A post-hoc analysis was conducted and
patients in the smartphone group were found to have a
signiﬁcantly higher odds of diagnosis in ﬁrst 7 postoperative days
(OR: 3.71, 95% CI: 1.02– 13.51, p = 0.043) (Table 2).
Healthcare service usage in those who received the smartphone
intervention or routine care was compared. Overall, 32 (14.3%) in
the smartphone group attended healthcare services regarding
their wound (n = 25 [11.2%] community services; 7 [3.1%] hospital
services), compared to 60 (22.3%) in the routine care group who
attended healthcare services regarding their wound (49 [18.2%]
community services; 11 [4.1%] hospital services). Patients in the
smartphone group had a signiﬁcantly lower rate of attendance at
community care (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.34–0.94, p = 0.030), but did
not have signiﬁcantly different rates of attendance at hospital
emergency services (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.28–1.96, p = 0.577).
Of the 41 surgical-site infections recorded, the majority (78.0%,
n = 32) were superﬁcial, with 5 deep (12.2%) and 4 (9.8%) organ-
space infections. There was no signiﬁcant difference observed in
the smartphone arm in the rate of deep/organ-space infections
(OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.28–5.53, p = 0.769) or major postoperative
complications (OR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.12–7.46, p = 0.959) compared to
routine care (Supplementary Table 2).

Furthermore, when the 30-day patient experience was com-
pared, those in the smartphone arm reported a signiﬁcantly more
positive experience on all measures assessed (Fig. 3). This included
access to care (with regards to waiting times [OR: 2.02, 95% CI:
1.17–3.53, p = 0.013] and ease of access to advice [OR: 1.89, 95%
CI: 1.10–3.26, p = 0.021]), as well as the quality of advice received
(OR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.40–4.40, p = 0.002).
Evaluation of the smartphone intervention
Each patient allocated to the smartphone arm automatically
received a prompt to routinely complete a survey at days 3, 7, and
15 (or could also additionally complete this at any point within the
30-day period if they had wound concerns). Responses out with
the response window for routine requests (wound concerns)
represented 10.5% (n = 38) of responses, with 52.6% (n = 20/38)
responses occurring prior to day 3 (median: 2, IQR: 2–4)
(Supplementary Fig. 1).
Among those randomised to the smartphone arm, 26.0% (n =
58) fully adhered to all routine requests, 41.7% (n = 93) displayed
partial adherence, and ﬁnally 32.3% (n = 72) did not utilise the
tool. There were no signiﬁcant differences in patient character-
istics observed between those who did or did not use the tool
(Supplementary Table 3). Furthermore, among patients who used
the tool there was a consistently positive experience reported,
with no signiﬁcant differences observed between those who had
partial or full adherence (Fig. 4).
Within the smartphone group, there were 21 (9.4%) patients
diagnosed with SSI. Of these patients, 7 (33.3%) had used the tool
in 48 h prior to diagnosis (5 diagnosed on the same day). All these
infections were identiﬁed based on patient-reported symptoms
(Table 3), categorised as either possible infection (n = 4) or
probable infection (n = 3). Incorporation of wound images offered
a signiﬁcant improvement to speciﬁcity from 84.4% (95% CI:
80.5–88.3%) to 93.6% (95% CI: 90.9–96.2%) (Table 3).

There was a high rate of concordance (85.6%, n = 238/278)
between assessment of patient-reported symptoms and wound
images. However, evaluations based on wound images were
sevenfold less likely to recommend in-patient assessment (1.8%
[n = 5] vs 12.6% [n = 35], McNemar’s OR: 7.00, 95% CI: 2.73–22.89,
p < 0.001). Overall, 7.5% (n = 25/335) of responses from the cohort
were identiﬁed as requiring assessment due to clinical suspicion of
SSI (Table 3). Of these patients, 1 in 6 (n = 4/25) was diagnosed with
an SSI compared to 1 in 100 (n = 3/310) diagnosed with an SSI in
those where there were overall no concerning features identiﬁed
(Table 3).
DISCUSSION
This trial has demonstrated that a remote wound follow-up digital
intervention increased the likelihood of a surgical-site infection
being diagnosed within the early postoperative period fourfold,
although it did not reduce the absolute time-to-diagnosis of SSI.
We also found this was superior to routine care for patients in
improving access and perceived quality of care post-discharge,
while reducing the rate of community care attendance. In
particular,
the
tool
demonstrated
high
negative
predictive
discrimination, meaning SSI could be ruled-out with conﬁdence.
This demonstrates the intervention was not only effective, but
feasible and safe to deliver remote postoperative wound care in
patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery.
Early recognition and treatment of SSI is essential in limiting the
progression and overall burden of disease, with evidence that
delays to intervention are associated with signiﬁcantly higher
morbidity and mortality10,11. Whilst our study was underpowered
with regards to its primary outcome (Fig. 2), there remained a
signiﬁcantly higher likelihood of diagnosis in the early postoperative

period (within 7 days of surgery) in the intervention group. SSIs
represent one of the most common healthcare-acquired infections
with the majority identiﬁed post-discharge2. Diagnosis and treat-
ment in the early postoperative period would be expected to yield
substantial beneﬁts at a population-level12. Nonetheless, there was
still a signiﬁcant minority (one third) of those in the intervention
arm who were diagnosed with SSI later in the postoperative period
(after 7 postoperative days). There was no evidence of infection
observed in previous responses for these patients, which aligns with
evidence that late-onset SSIs represent a distinct pathophysiological
process13. This cannot exclude the possibility of gradual progression
of a sub-clinical infection or insufﬁcient sensitivity or frequency of
responses related to the tool itself. Further trials to reduce time-to-
diagnosis of SSI should consider this potential bimodal distribution
in the incidence of SSI in the early postoperative period.
There is substantial interest in the use of patient-reported
symptoms14 and wound images5,7 for the purposes of remote
diagnosis of SSI, although their relative value in the clinical
evaluation was previously unclear. The high speciﬁcity combined
with the low rate of false negatives in the triage of wounds for
further assessment of SSI in this trial compares favourably to those
expected in similar screening tests for mammography15 or
pulmonary embolism16. Despite being designed for high sensitiv-
ity, the use of patient-reported symptoms alone successfully
classiﬁed 82.6% (n = 276/334) of responses as not requiring
clinical assessment, with no false negatives. However, as patient-
reported symptoms are known to have high sensitivity for SSI14,
there remains the potential iatrogenic harm due to overdiagnosis
of infections that would otherwise self-resolve. A large-scale,
multicentre trial would be required to detect differences in the
severity or Clavien-Dindo grade associated with SSI, however,
there were no signiﬁcant differences were observed on these
measures (Supplementary Table 2). Together with an overall SSI
rate consistent with previous national estimates17, this does
provide evidence suggesting that there was no clear Hawthorne
effect12 or measurement bias leading to an overdiagnosis of
clinically insigniﬁcant surgical-site infections within TWIST.
The incorporation of wound images to the assessment process
offered a clinically signiﬁcant beneﬁt to the speciﬁcity and
demonstrated a high rate of concordance (85.6%) with patient-
reported symptoms. While just 1% (n = 3/307) of wound images
were rated as “no concerns” despite a clinical diagnosis of SSI
within the following 48 h, this nonetheless represented 42.9%
(n = 3/7) of all infections. Whilst this remains consistent with
previous literature exploring image-based diagnosis of SSI6,18,19, it
is recognised that the diagnostic criteria for SSI remain subjective,
with inter-rater disagreement observed between “gold-standard”
in-person
assessments20,21.
Furthermore,
it
should
also
be
recognised that particularly organ-space SSI may not have any
associated visual evidence, further complicating their remote
diagnosis. There is currently sparce evidence regarding the
minimally acceptable criteria for patients and healthcare teams
regarding the diagnostic accuracy of digital health interventions,
with few implemented in routine clinical practice.
TWIST is a pragmatic clinical trial providing evidence of the
effectiveness of this digital health intervention on postoperative
care and incorporates assessment of the wider implications on
health service delivery. Emergency abdominal surgery represents
an initial use-case given the higher rates of SSI, but there are
broader applications in areas of healthcare, particularly as patients
increasingly expect to be involved and empowered regarding
their healthcare22. This intervention adopts a patient-driven
approach to wound assessment, empowering individuals in their
own postoperative recovery, as well as enhancing communication
with surgical teams in the early postoperative phase. Finally, the
digital nature of this intervention provides further opportunities
for
automating

wound
assessment

particular using machine learning computer vision approaches for
image assessment7.
There were several limitations to this clinical trial. Firstly, whilst
the randomisation process generated balanced groups in terms of
patient characteristics (Table 1), there remained a small but
notable deviation from the intended 1:1 allocation (45:55). This
was identiﬁed following the completion of the trial, and was due
to natural variation in the simple computer-generated randomisa-
tion sequence. While there is no evidence that this affected the
validity of results, it reduced the power to detect a signiﬁcant
difference in the primary outcome. Secondly, one third of patients
(n = 72/223) randomised to the smartphone tool did not submit
information regarding their wounds over the 30-day postoperative
period. However, there was no evidence of signiﬁcant bias in the
patient or operative characteristics between those who were
compliant with the intervention and those who were not
(Supplementary Table 3). Therefore, while signiﬁcant beneﬁts
were observed in the intervention arm, these results represent an
underestimation of the optimal efﬁcacy but a pragmatic under-
standing of the effectiveness in practice. Thirdly, only one senior
clinician (EMH) reviewed responses to provide clinical recommen-
dations, and so given the subjective nature of SSI, it is possible
that different clinical staff may provide different recommenda-
tions19. Further work is required to investigate inter-rater reliability
among those who would use this system in practice, for example,
different professions (medical or nursing staff) and stages of
training. Finally, the schedule for routine completion was chosen
to encompass the peak incidence of infection and to minimise
volunteer bias. However, the grouping of SSI diagnosis around the
scheduled day 7 and 15 responses may indicate increasing the
frequency of routine responses would enhance the effectiveness
of the intervention in reducing time-to-diagnosis of SSI. This must
be balanced with the burden imposed to patients and the service
to review in a timely manner.
The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed an enormous disruption
to the delivery of surgical care, with the routine use of
teleconsultations becoming a necessity9. This has accelerated
what may have otherwise taken decades of integrating tele-
medicine into routine clinical practice, with high rates of
satisfaction from patients and healthcare staff8,9. Policy makers
and healthcare planners should anticipate an ongoing and
increasing demand for these services following the pandemic.
This trial has demonstrated that remote postoperative surveil-
lance, can be safely delivered while reducing health service usage.

This and similar digital health interventions for remote post-
operative monitoring may further improve Enhanced Recovery
after Surgery (ERAS) programmes by increasing safety and
conﬁdence in early discharge23, and improve SSI surveillance
efforts24,25. With increasing burdens placed upon community and
hospital services from other sources, minimising unnecessary
attendances and early intervention in the SSI disease process can
provide substantial beneﬁts for healthcare systems and patients
themselves. This will be of increased importance as healthcare
systems contend with the ongoing, indirect and secondary effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic26.
Furthermore, remote healthcare has immense potential to
improve both access and perceived quality of care, as observed in
this trial (Fig. 3) and other studies27,28. This may have the greatest
value in rural or underserved communities, where barriers already
exist in access to in-person care29,30. However, we must ensure
that a digital divide does not perpetuate existing inequities in
care. Disadvantaged groups who potentially stand to beneﬁt
most from improved access to care from telehealth (such as those
who are elderly31, or from low socioeconomic status32 or minority
ethnic backgrounds33) may lack sufﬁcient digital access and/or
literacy to gain equitably from these interventions. Notably, 11%
of patients in TWIST were ineligible due to a lack of a smartphone,
and these patients were disproportionately older. As such, given
the mean age of patients within TWIST was 44.5 years old, care
should be taken if generalising these results to older emergency
surgical patients. Patient-public involvement from across societal
groups will be essential in the development and further
implementation of digital health interventions in practice. This
should incorporate best practice identiﬁed from service changes
already being piloted out of necessity during the ongoing COVID-
19 pandemic34. Further work is underway to understand how to
optimise implementation of digital postoperative surveillance
into routine practice, including promoting proactive engagement
from all patients.
Remote postoperative care has become commonplace inter-
nationally since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many
health systems already having implemented this within their
services. Focus now needs to be on how these interventions can
be evidenced and evaluated35, and sustainably maintained
moving forward. The TWIST trial provides a comprehensive
evaluation
of
smartphone-delivered
wound
assessment
for
surgical-site infection and has demonstrated that patient-driven
digital postoperative wound follow-up can be feasibly delivered.
This can facilitate triage of patients to the appropriate level of
assessment required, allowing diagnosis of SSI earlier in the
postoperative period. Furthermore, patients demonstrate a clear
preference and positive opinion of remote wound assessment in
postoperative care. As the global community recovers from the
COVID-19 pandemic, this presents an ideal circumstance to
capitalise on greater familiarity and acceptance of telemedicine
among both healthcare staff and patients in order to further
improve postoperative care.

Tracking wound infection with smartphone technology (TWIST) was a 2-
arm, parallel design, pragmatic randomised control trial conducted across
two tertiary hospitals in a large health board in the United Kingdom (UK),
serving a mixed urban and rural population of over 800,000.
Adult inpatients (aged 16 years or older) who underwent emergency
abdominal surgery (on the same admission as diagnosis) were screened for
eligibility. Key inclusion criteria were smartphone ownership (with internet
access) and capacity to provide informed consent. Patients were excluded
based on self-reported visual impairment which would prevent interaction
with online resources. Written consent for each patient was obtained in
line with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards.
TWIST was reviewed and approved by South-East Scotland Research
Ethics Committee (Number: 16/SS/0072). The trial was pre-registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02704897, registration: 10/03/16), and the protocol
published36. This study is reported according to the Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline37. A pre-planned
internal pilot study in the ﬁrst 80 patients recruited was conducted to
ensure the trial design was practical and deliverable.
The trial was funded by the University of Edinburgh and conducted with
support from existing staff and resources in the NHS Lothian health board.
All authors had full access to all the data in the study and were involved in
data interpretation and writing of the report. The corresponding author
had ﬁnal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication
Randomisation and masking
Eligible participants who provided informed consent were randomly
allocated (1:1 ratio) to receive either routine postoperative care or the
addition of a smartphone-delivered wound assessment tool. The random
number sequence was computer-generated and integrated into the data
collection platform. No stratiﬁcation or minimisation was used. Research
team members performing randomisation did not have access to the
sequence, and the allocation process was automated.
Due to the nature of the intervention, patients and healthcare
practitioners with which the patient had contact following discharge were
not blinded to the allocation status. However, clinical teams and outcome
assessors at 30-days were blinded to allocation status.
Procedures
Enroled patient details (including mobile telephone number) were entered
into a secure Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database.
Furthermore, additional sociodemographic and operative data were
collected based on clinically relevant risk factors for SSI. These included
age, sex, ethnicity (White, or Black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups
[BAME]), obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2), diabetes mellitus,
immunosuppression (known HIV positive status, corticosteroids, che-
motherapy received within 6 weeks, or other immunomodulating drugs),
operative approach (open or laparoscopic), operative complexity (minor/
intermediate or major/complex major according to the BUPA Schedule of
Procedures38), and CDC surgical wound classiﬁcation3 (clean/clean-
contaminated, or contaminated/dirty).
Patients who were randomised to the routine care arm received no
further communication from the research team prior to 30-day follow-up.
Patients randomised to the smartphone group had a personal hyperlink
automatically sent by short-messaging system (SMS) to their smartphones.
This allowed immediate access to a secure online wound assessment tool
for the 30-day postoperative period (starting from postoperative day 1), to
facilitate patient-driven contact regarding any wound concerns (Fig. 5A).
Furthermore, patients were scheduled to receive prompts to complete the
tool at postoperative days 3, 7, and 15 irrespective of wound concerns.
Patients were asked to complete these routine requests whether or not
they were an inpatient at the time.
The smartphone-delivered wound assessment tool required submission
of (1) SSI-speciﬁc patient-reported symptoms and (2) images of their
wound (Supplementary Table 1)36. Patient-reported symptoms were
based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
classiﬁcation criteria, and the ASEPSIS model (Additional treatment,
Serous discharge, Erythema, Purulent exudate, and Separation of the
deep tissues, the Isolation of bacteria, and the duration of Inpatient
Stay)3,39. This addressed evidence of SSI and/or resultant systemic
infection that could be considered apparent to the patient, while
minimising the burden of completion. Participants were asked to upload
at least one contemporaneous photograph of their wound for each use of
the wound assessment tool.
Submission of a response by a patient generated an automated alert for
review of the information. Automated classiﬁcation of patient-reported
symptoms was performed with a prespeciﬁed clinical algorithm36 Given
the investigative nature of this study and patient safety as a priority, a
senior clinician (EMH) reviewed all patient-reported symptom responses,
wound images, and algorithm outputs in real time. The evidence of SSI on
patient-reported symptoms and wound images was classiﬁed separately
as either: low-risk (no apparent evidence of SSI), medium-risk (possible
evidence of SSI), or high-risk (probable evidence of SSI). Clinical advice
was based on patient-reported symptoms, with wound images providing
supplementary
information,
providing
three
possible
classiﬁcations:

(1) that there was no clear evidence of SSI present, but to attend
healthcare services or submit a further form if ongoing concerns (overall
low-risk); (2) to attend community healthcare services for clinical review
(overall medium-risk); or (3) to attend emergency services at their
treatment centre for clinical review (overall high-risk). These recommen-
dations were agreed in collaboration with the emergency surgical team.
Submission of this clinical recommendation was performed within a
target
of
24 h
from
the
time
of
ﬁrst
alert,
with
this
response
communicated to the patient through SMS on an automated basis on
submission by the reviewing clinician (Fig. 5A). Wound image classiﬁca-
tion with convolutional neural networks was performed in an embedded
study. Outputs from this were not available for real-time patient
assessment, and these will be reported separately.
Outcomes and deﬁnitions
The primary outcome measure was time-to-diagnosis (days) of the SSI
(superﬁcial, deep or organ-space)3 within the 30-day postoperative period.
Secondary outcomes considered healthcare attendance for wound review,
and Clavien-Dindo grade of SSI-associated complications40 (divided into
“minor” [Grade I-II] and “major” [Grade III-V]) and patient experience at 30-
day follow-up (delivered via a separate questionnaire alongside the 30-day
follow-up36).
All patients enroled were assessed by clinicians blinded to the
randomisation status through three independent approaches. Firstly,
patients received 30-day postoperative follow-up following a standardised
format. This reviewed the occurrence of patient-reported symptoms
related to their wound over the 30-day period, any healthcare attendances
and any treatments received in that time. Secondly, all participants were
provided a log on enrolment where any wound reviews conducted in the
community could be recorded and returned to the trial team in a pre-paid
envelope. This included the date of assessment, whether an SSI was
diagnosed, and any therapeutic intervention performed or commenced.
Finally, a data-enabled trial approach utilised the electronic patient record
for each patient to identify healthcare attendances and any diagnosis of
SSI (including all microbiology results from swabs taken in the community
or hospital). On the basis of these three sources of information, two
independent, blinded clinical researchers (trained in applying the CDC
criteria3) determined if an SSI was present. The clinician involved in the
assessment of patient responses (EMH) was not involved in this decision
process, and these blinded outcome assessors did not have access to any
patient responses or associated clinical recommendations from the
smartphone arm.
For those allocated to the smartphone arm, further secondary outcomes
regarding the wound assessment tool were evaluated based on patient
adherence and diagnostic accuracy. Responses submitted within 48 h
following a routine request (postoperative days 3, 7, and 15) were
considered as adherent responses (Fig. 5B). All other responses out with
these windows were considered as a submission of a wound concern. Full
adherence was deﬁned as the completion of all three routine response
requests in the follow-up period. In comparison, partial adherence was
deﬁned as any usage of the tool that did not meet the criteria of full
adherence, and non-adherence as non-completion of any responses.
For determining the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the intervention, a
pragmatic approach was taken. Responses submitted in the 48 h prior to
a clinical diagnosis of surgical-site infection were expected to have
evidence of SSI that would be identiﬁable on submitted responses (Fig.
5C). As such, any response evaluated as “no concerns” with an SSI
clinically diagnosed in the following 48 h was considered a false negative
result. Similarly, any response evaluated as “possible” or “probable” SSI
yet not leading to a subsequent clinical diagnosis within 48 h was
considered a false-positive result.
Statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted according to a pre-speciﬁed analysis plan, on an
intention-to-treat basis (unless identiﬁed as post hoc). We calculated that a
sample size of 490 patients were required to demonstrate the superiority
of the smartphone intervention (1-day difference in time-to-diagnosis),
with a power of 90% and signiﬁcance level of 5%. This assumed a 10% SSI
rate in both groups (in line with national data17), a standard deviation of
1 day, and an attrition rate of 10%. Interim results were viewed following
completion of the internal pilot study, however, no statistical testing was
performed and so no adjustments were made for interim analysis.
Continuous data were summarized as mean (standard deviation) or
median (interquartile range) based on visual and statistical evaluation for
normality, with appropriate parametric or non-parametric tests performed.
The primary outcome (time-to-diagnosis) was compared using a two-
sample t-test, as well as a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis as a
secondary outcome. Categorical data were cross-tabulated, and differences
tested using Pearson’s chi-squared test, Fisher’s exact test, or McNemar’s
chi-squared test as appropriate. Patient experience was dichotomised into
positive and non-positive (neutral or negative) responses to questions.
Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed for evaluating
the diagnostic accuracy of clinical diagnosis of SSI within 48 h based on
clinical evaluation of patient-reported symptoms, wound images, and the
overall impression of a submitted response. Data are censored at the point
of clinical SSI diagnosis, and results are presented using the area under the
curve (AUC), sensitivity, speciﬁcity, positive predictive value (PPV), and
negative predictive value (NPV).
Statistical signiﬁcance was set a priori at p < 0.05, and all statistical
analyses performed in R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria).
