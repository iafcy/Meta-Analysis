Background: Accurate assessment of surgical-site infection (SSI) is crucial for surveillance and research.
Self-reporting patient measures are needed because current SSI tools are limited for assessing patients
after leaving hospital. The Bluebelle Wound Healing Questionnaire (WHQ) was developed for patient or
observer completion; this study tested its acceptability, scale structure, reliability and validity in patients
with closed primary wounds after abdominal surgery.
Methods: Patients completed the WHQ (self-assessment) within 30 days after leaving hospital
and returned it by post. Healthcare professionals completed the WHQ (observer assessment) by tele-
phone or face-to-face. Questionnaire response rates and patient acceptability were assessed. Factor
analysis and Cronbach‚Äôs ùõÇexamined scale structure and internal consistency. Test‚Äìretest and self- versus
observer reliability assessments were performed. Sensitivity and specificity for SSI discrimination against
a face-to-face reference diagnosis (using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria) were
examined.
Results: Some 561 of 792 self-assessments (70‚ãÖ8 per cent) and 597 of 791 observer assessments (75‚ãÖ5
per cent) were completed, with few missing data or problems reported. Data supported a single-scale
structure with strong internal consistency (ùõÇgreater than 0‚ãÖ8). Reliability between test‚Äìretest and self-
versus observer assessments was good (ùõã0‚ãÖ6 or above for the majority of items). Sensitivity and
specificity for SSI discrimination was high (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
0‚ãÖ91).
Conclusion: The Bluebelle WHQ is acceptable, reliable and valid with a single-scale structure for post-
discharge patient or observer assessment of SSI in closed primary wounds.

Introduction
Surgical-site infection (SSI) is the third most common
healthcare-associated infection in the UK1 influencing
patient outcomes, quality of life and healthcare resources2.
Rates of SSI vary considerably, depending on the type of
surgery performed (for instance, clean or contaminated)
and individual patient risk factors. Many SSIs take time
to become apparent, often developing or becoming symp-
tomatic after the patient has left hospital3,4. Rate estimates
are influenced by methods and timing of data collection,
particularly the robustness of postdischarge follow-up2,5,6.
Accurate assessment after discharge is therefore key to SSI
surveillance and research is needed to minimize this impor-
tant healthcare issue7.
Assessing wounds for SSI after hospital discharge can be
done by patient self-reporting, by asking patients to return
for an outpatient appointment, or by conducting home
visits. The latter two methods are resource-intensive8.
Patient self-reporting can reduce these burdens, although
accurate
tools
are
needed.

for use in a postdischarge setting, and have been criticized
because they do not account for symptom severity ‚Äì an
important aspect in SSI diagnosis12. The Bluebelle Wound
Healing Questionnaire (WHQ) was developed with input
from patients and multidisciplinary healthcare profession-
als to address these limitations. It assesses signs, symptoms
and wound care interventions relevant for the diagnosis of
SSI in closed primary wounds, specifically after the patient
has left hospital13. Early work13 has demonstrated that the
WHQ is comprehensive, easily understood, and can be
completed by patients and/or observers (healthcare pro-
fessionals). The present study examined the acceptability,
scale structure, reliability and validity of the WHQ in a
large sample of patients undergoing surgery with closed
primary abdominal wounds.
Methods
The Bluebelle Wound Healing Questionnaire
The WHQ was developed as part of the Bluebelle study14,
a feasibility study that included a pilot RCT to examine
whether an RCT of different wound dressing strategies
for reducing SSI was possible14,15. Initial development of
the WHQ has been reported previously13. The WHQ
was designed as a single questionnaire for patient and/or
observer completion.
The version of the questionnaire undergoing valida-
tion in this study consisted of 16 items: eight relating to
signs and symptoms of SSI, and eight relating to wound
care interventions. Two of these items included additional
components, collecting more detail on signs and symp-
toms, if applicable. Early versions of the questionnaire also
included questions on resource use (for the wider Bluebelle
feasibility study) that were not relevant to the diagnosis of
SSI, and therefore are not included in these analyses.
Response categories for sign and symptom items were:
‚Äònot at all‚Äô (score 0), ‚Äòa little‚Äô (1), ‚Äòquite a bit‚Äô (2) and ‚Äòa
lot‚Äô (3). Response categories for wound care intervention
items were: ‚Äòyes‚Äô (score 1), ‚Äòno‚Äô (0) and ‚Äòdon‚Äôt know‚Äô. Higher
scores, therefore, indicated more problems.
Study design
Two data sets from the Bluebelle study were used in this
analysis: data from a cohort recruited specifically to validate
this new measure; and data from the pilot RCT. Research
ethical approval was granted from the National Health Ser-
vice (NHS) Health Research Authority National Research
Ethics Service (NRES) Committee London ‚Äì Camden
and Kings Cross (reference 14/LO/0640) and the South
West ‚Äì Frenchay Research Ethics Committee (reference
15/SW/0008).
Eligible participants were aged over 16 years, undergoing
elective or unplanned abdominal general surgery or cae-
sarean section. Participants who lacked capacity, ability to
read or understand English, and prisoners were excluded.
Further
inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria
were
rele-
vant to the wider requirements of the Bluebelle study
and have been reported previously14. Studies ran between
August 2015 and January 2016, and between March 2016
and November 2016 (cohort study and pilot RCT respect-
ively) from four UK NHS hospital trusts. Participants
were recruited by research nurses, surgical trainees or
other trained members of the study team on hospital wards
before or after surgery. Potential participants were given
an information leaflet, and were provided with sufficient
time to consider involvement and discuss the study before
being approached again to take part. All participants were
asked to give written informed consent.
Data collection
Fig. 1 illustrates the study design and data collection.
Wound Healing Questionnaire self-assessment
The WHQ was distributed by post for participants to com-
plete and return (by stamped addressed envelope, included)
30 days after surgery. Instructions were to complete
the WHQ in relation to events since hospital discharge. A
subset of 50 cohort participants (sampled during 1 month
of the study) were posted an additional WHQ within
1 week of completing the first WHQ (for test‚Äìretest assess-
ment). In a series of debriefing questions included with the
WHQ, data were collected from the cohort partici-
pants on the time needed for WHQ completion, whether
help was required, and whether items were confusing or
difficult to answer. Reminders for non-responders were
sent only to participants of the pilot RCT.
Wound Healing Questionnaire observer
assessment
In the cohort study, the WHQ was completed by a clinical
member of the study team via a telephone call with partici-
pants 4‚Äì5 weeks after surgery. In the pilot RCT, the WHQ
was completed by a clinical member of the study team dur-
ing the participant‚Äôs face-to-face follow-up appointment
between 4 and 8 weeks after surgery.
Reference diagnoses of whether SSI had occurred since
the time of surgery were made in face-to-face study
follow-up appointments between 4 and 8 weeks after the
operation using Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC) criteria and classification of no SSI, superficial,

deep or organ/space16. Diagnoses were made by an inde-
pendent member of the study team, blinded to the WHQ
self- and observer assessment, using any available sources
of information from the participant and hospital records.
All pilot RCT participants and a convenience sample of
cohort participants (sampled by availability due to limited
study resources) underwent a face-to-face reference wound
assessment.
Analyses
All 16 items were included in the initial analysis. Missing
responses to the items with multiple components (collect-
ing more detail on signs and symptoms, if applicable) were
imputed with values of zero if no response was expected
(for example, if the sign or symptom had not occurred).
Summation of item scores was performed as suggested
by the data. Reference SSI diagnoses were dichotomized
to create a binary variable with 0 = no SSI and 1 = SSI
of any type (combining CDC classifications of superficial,
deep and organ/space SSI due to low numbers of reported
deep and organ/space SSI).
Acceptability
Acceptability of the WHQ was explored in three ways: first,
by examining response rates (the proportion of completed
WHQ self- and observer assessments); second, by explor-
ing missing responses to individual items (indicating pos-
sible issues such as not understanding the item); and third,
by examining answers to the debriefing questions.
Scale structure
Exploratory factor analyses examined the underlying
structure and constructs of the questionnaire. Analyses
were conducted separately for self- and observer data.
First, all iterations of item pairs were explored using
Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficients. Pairs with very high
correlations (r = 0‚ãÖ9 or above) were examined for similar-
ity and considered for redundancy and exclusion before
conducting factor analyses17. Next, three separate factor
analysis models were run, specifying the maximum num-
ber of factors to be retained as one, two and three factors
(maximum-likelihood method of estimation). Models were
initially explored with data from the cohort study, and
the best-fitting model was applied to data from the pilot
RCT as a method of independent validation of the scale
structure. The best-fitting model was applied finally to
the combined cohort and pilot RCT data. A sensitivity
factor analysis was performed using a polychoric matrix
because of the ordinal, categorical nature of the WHQ
data18. Multitrait scaling analyses were also applied as a
comparative statistical approach19.
Internal consistency (internal reliability) of the scales
identified from the factor analyses was examined using
Cronbach‚Äôs Œ± coefficient17. Values greater than 0‚ãÖ7 were
considered to have good internal consistency17.
Reliability
Test‚Äìretest reliability20 was assessed by comparing self-
assessment responses to the WHQ completed twice over
a period of anticipated stable health. Stable health was
assumed if responders reported that they had not been
back into hospital for treatment with a problem with the
wound (item 11) in the retest assessment. Cross-tabulations
of responses and weighted Œ∫ statistics were calculated.

Validation of the Bluebelle Wound Healing Questionnaire
229
Equal weights between response categories for ordinal
items (items 1‚Äì8) were assumed, with weighted values of
0, 0‚ãÖ333, 0‚ãÖ667 and 1 between categories. Œ∫ values below
0‚ãÖ4 were considered to indicate poor agreement. Values
between 0‚ãÖ4 and 0‚ãÖ75 were considered to indicate fair to
good agreement17.
Inter-rater reliability (agreement between self- and
observer assessments, where data from both assessments
were available) was explored, to examine the reliability of
the self-assessment for collecting outcome data in a future
large-scale trial. Cross-tabulations of item responses
and weighted Œ∫ statistics were calculated as described
above. Percentages of agreement and discordance were
examined.
Validity
Criterion validity was examined against the reference SSI
diagnosis to demonstrate how well the WHQ performed
in discriminating between individuals with and those with-
out SSI. Cross-tabulations of the reference CDC diagnosis
(‚Äòno SSI‚Äô or ‚ÄòSSI of any type‚Äô) and a binary variable of the
self-assessment WHQ total score (created by a cut-off
score; for instance, a WHQ total score of less than or equal
to x) were compared. Sensitivity and 1 ‚àíspecificity values
of the WHQ for different cut-off scores were used to plot
a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, represent-
ing the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity21.
The overall ability of the WHQ to discriminate between
individuals with and those without SSI was measured
by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and 95 per
cent confidence intervals. An AUC value approaching
1‚ãÖ0 was interpreted to indicate good discrimination with
high sensitivity and specificity, whereas a value of 0‚ãÖ5 was
interpreted as the measure not being able to discriminate
at all21.
Analyses were performed using STATA¬Æ statistical soft-
ware version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).
Modifications for the final questionnaire
Findings from the above were used to inform modifica-
tions to the final version of the WHQ, considering rates
of missing data for individual items, answers to the debrief-
ing questions and overlap between items (if correlations of r
greater than 0‚ãÖ9 were observed).

Acceptability
Response rates
Self- and observer WHQ assessments were completed
for 561 of 792 (70‚ãÖ8 per cent) and 597 of 791 (75‚ãÖ5 per cent)
participants respectively, with 470 of 791 (59‚ãÖ4 per cent)
of these participants having both sets of data completed.
In total, 104 of 792 participants (13‚ãÖ1 per cent) did not
have any WHQ self- or observer assessments available
(complete non-responders).
Missing responses to items
Less than 3 per cent of responses were missing for most
items (10 of 16) in the self-assessments and no items
had more than 4 per cent of responses missing (Table S1,
supporting information). For observer assessments, nearly
all items (15 of 16) had less than 2 per cent of responses
missing. Missing responses to the additional components
of the two items for which further information on signs and
symptoms was intended to be collected (if applicable) were,
however, high, with up to 43 per cent of self-assessments
missing a response when one would have been expected.
Missing responses to these additional components were
lower in the observer assessments, although levels were still
notable and ranged between 8 and 17 per cent (Table S1,
supporting information).
Responses to debriefing questions
Most participants (276 of 302, 91‚ãÖ4 per cent) reported that
the questionnaire took fewer than 10 min to complete. Less
than 6 per cent reported needing help or finding items
difficult or confusing to answer.
Scale structure
A high correlation (r = 0‚ãÖ95) was observed between item 4
(‚ÄòHave the edges of any part of the wound separated/gaped
open of their own accord? (spontaneous dehiscence)‚Äô) and
its additional component collecting further information:
4a (‚ÄòDid the skin separate?‚Äô). Study team agreement of
similarity in the underlying concept of these questions
deemed item 4a to be redundant, and it was therefore
excluded from factor analyses.
Factor analyses of the cohort and pilot RCT data sep-
arately supported a single-scale structure. Results from
the combined data set are shown in Table 2. Item factor
loadings ranged between 0‚ãÖ32 and 0‚ãÖ87 in data from
participant self-assessments, and between 0‚ãÖ33 and 0‚ãÖ85
in data from observer assessments (with the exception
of one item with a factor loading of 0‚ãÖ03). Examina-
tion of eigenvalues and factor loadings provided little

Data suggested it was sensible to calculate a WHQ total
score by summing the raw scores for each item without any

data.
Reliability
Test‚Äìretest reliability
A total of 44 of 50 participants (88 per cent) included
in the test‚Äìretest sample (who all reported stable health)
completed and returned a second WHQ. The median
time between test‚Äìretest assessments was 5 (i.q.r. 4‚Äì7)
days. Agreement in responses for test‚Äìretest assess-
ments was high, with levels of observed agreement
greater than 86‚ãÖ2 per cent for all items (Table S2, sup-
porting information). Where it was possible to calculate
a reliable Œ∫ statistic, the majority of values were greater
than 0‚ãÖ59.
Inter-rater reliability
Self- and observer assessments were available for 59‚ãÖ4
per cent of participants, with a median of 8 (i.q.r. 2‚Äì16)
days between assessments. Agreement was generally
high (observed agreement for any item greater than
84‚ãÖ3 per cent), although participants showed a trend
to report levels of signs and symptoms to be slightly
more severe than observers; an example from one item
is shown in Fig. 2 (for data from all items, see Fig. S1,
supporting information). Where it was possible to cal-
culate a reliable Œ∫ statistic, values were between 0‚ãÖ40
and 0‚ãÖ74 for the majority of items (Table S3, support-
ing information). Some minor discrepancy was shown
between participant and observer responses to wound-care
intervention items, and whether these interventions had
occurred.

(52‚ãÖ7 per cent). Sensitivity and specificity values of the
WHQ self-assessment for discriminating between SSI
and no SSI were high, with an area under the ROC
curve of 0‚ãÖ91 (95 per cent c.i. 0‚ãÖ83 to 0‚ãÖ98) (Fig. 3).
Cross-tabulation of the self-assessment WHQ total score
(excluding item 4a) with the reference SSI diagnosis is
provided in Table S4 (supporting information). Sensitivity
and specificity values for selected WHQ cut-off scores
are shown in Table S5 (supporting information). From the
present data set, a cut-off score of 6‚Äì8 appeared to be
a reasonable threshold for suggesting no SSI/SSI com-
pared with the reference diagnosis, with relatively few
misclassifications.
Modifications for the final questionnaire
Evidence supported the need for minor revisions to the
WHQ format to improve its efficiency and minimize
missing data. Item 3 and its additional components col-
lecting more information (3a‚Äìc) were restructured into
three stand-alone items. Item 4a was removed. Items were
renumbered to accommodate these changes. The response
option of ‚Äòdon‚Äôt know‚Äô was removed. Questions collecting
resource use purely for the purposes of the economic anal-
ysis of the Bluebelle pilot RCT were no longer included.
The final WHQ items, after these revisions, are shown
in Table 3.

Discussion
This study examined the acceptability, scale structure, reli-
ability and validity of the WHQ for use as a patient- or
observer-completed tool for the assessment of SSI in closed
primary surgical wounds after abdominal surgery. The
WHQ was found to be acceptable to patients and demon-
strated good response rates, with low levels of missing
data. Analyses supported a single-scale structure to assess
SSI that made clinical and practical sense. Test‚Äìretest
reliability was high, and agreement between participants
and observers was good. The WHQ demonstrated high
sensitivity and specificity for SSI discrimination compared
with a face-to-face reference CDC diagnosis. It is there-
fore suggested that the WHQ is an acceptable, reliable
and valid patient-reported or observer-completed ques-
tionnaire for assessing SSI in closed primary surgical
wounds.
Existing self-reported questionnaires for patients have
been adapted mostly from the CDC criteria and ASEPSIS
tools11,16,22. They are limited because of the lack of user
involvement in development. Criticisms include that they
are complicated and difficult to complete11,23. These
self-reporting measures are also limited in their design,
such as asking for yes/no responses to questions with-
out the option to report the amount or severity of the
sign/symptom. This is important when assessing a wound,
as demonstrated, for example, in a recent study12 that
found the amount of exudate was more strongly associated
with SSI than with the type of exudate. Existing patient
measures, however, do not provide an opportunity for
the amount of exudate to be captured. The same study
also highlighted that bright red skin was observed in
patients who had SSI, but also in patients who did not,
providing another example where capturing the amount
or severity of a sign/symptom rather than just its pres-
ence or absence is important. The WHQ has addressed
these limitations by involving a multidisciplinary team
(including patients, surgeons, nurses, microbiologists and
health service researchers) in its development and by using
a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods; it
also underwent rigorous pretesting during development to
ensure face and content validity13. The result is a reliable,
valid, comprehensive and uncomplicated questionnaire
that includes an ordinal response scale to capture symptom
severity.
The study has some limitations. First, a true standard
for the diagnosis of SSI without subjective perceptions or
opinions is lacking, with the result that tests for criterion
validity are limited. The CDC classification of SSI diag-
nosis was chosen as the best available reference standard
for comparing the WHQ as it is the most commonly used
and widely regarded tool available. Second, reports of the
more major wound care interventions (such as debride-
ment and drainage) were rare in this data set; this may
have an impact, for example, on factor analyses. In addi-
tion, some discrepancy was observed between participant
and observer reports of these major interventions, suggest-
ing possible low fidelity of participant responses. Although
these more major interventions were rare in this data set
and the number of discordant reports between self- and
observer assessments were few, this discrepancy may be

Validation of the Bluebelle Wound Healing Questionnaire

important to consider and warrants further investigation,
as it may have implications for studies relying solely on
patient self-assessment for collecting outcome data. Miss-
ing data in responses to the additional component parts of
items collecting further information on signs and symp-
toms (if applicable) were relatively high, although this may
be explained by the layout of the questionnaire; modifica-
tions in the revised version aim to address this. Although
the wide range of abdominal operations is a strength of
this study, it is recognized that the proportion of par-
ticipants undergoing caesarean section (12‚ãÖ2 per cent) is
likely to have affected the representative age of the rest
of the sample presenting for general abdominal surgery
and may have affected the findings. Finally, other limita-
tions of this work relate to its testing and use after abdom-
inal surgery alone, and for wounds healing by primary
intention.
Further use and validation of the final version of the
WHQ in other types of wound and surgical specialty is
underway. Cut-off scores for SSI diagnosis will be explored.
In addition, members of the research group are exploring
the feasibility of collecting digital images of the wound
taken by patients as a tool to use in conjunction with the
WHQ for improving remote and blinded SSI assessment.
Advances in digital technology, including the use of smart
phones and other tablet devices with cameras, mean that
obtaining data from patients after discharge is becoming
increasing possible24,25. These moves towards using digital
technologies to obtain patient-reported data, including
images of wounds, have great potential for improving SSI
assessment and ultimately patient care.
