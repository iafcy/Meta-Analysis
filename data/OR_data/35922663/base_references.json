            "title": "Delayed Sleeve Gastrectomy Following Liver Transplantation: A 5-Year Experience.",
            "abstract": "Obesity has become an epidemic in the United States over the past decade, and recent studies have shown this trend in the liver transplantation (LT) population. These patients may be candidates for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) to promote significant and sustained weight loss to prevent recurrence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. However, safety remains a concern, and efficacy in this setting is uncertain. A single-institution database from 2014 to 2018 was queried for patients undergoing LSG following LT. The selection criteria for surgery were consistent with National Institutes of Health guidelines, and patients were at least 6 months after LT. A total of 15 patients (median age, 59.0 years; Caucasian, 86.7%; and female, 60%) underwent LSG following LT. Median time from LT to LSG was 2.2 years with a median follow-up period of 2.6 years. The median hospital length of stay (LOS) was 2 days after LSG. Mortality and rate of liver allograft rejection was 0, and there was 1 postoperative complication (a surgical site infection). Following LSG, body mass index (BMI) decreased from 42.7 to 35.9 kg/m2 (P < 0.01), and in 12 patients with at least 1 year of follow-up, the total body weight loss was 20.6%. Following LSG in patients with diabetes, the median daily insulin requirements decreased from 98 (49-118) to 0 (0-29) units/day (P = 0.02), and 60% discontinued insulin. Post-LT patients had a similar decrease in BMI and reduction in comorbidities at 1 year compared with a matched non-LT patient cohort. In the largest patient series to date, we show that LSG following LT is safe, effective, and does not increase the incidence of liver allograft rejection. Larger longer-term studies are needed to confirm underlying metabolic changes following LSG."

Patients who received untimely (OR=3.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-6.4) and discontinued inappropriately (OR 6.38, 95% CI=2.5-16.2) prophylaxis were more likely to develop an ESBL SSI. In addition, patients with an organ/space infection compared with superficial had a higher rate of a resistant infection (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.3-13.9). Among patients not given timely or appropriately discontinued prophylaxis, post-operative cephalosporin use (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.4-7.7) was associated with ESBL E. coli SSIs.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The appropriate timing and duration of perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis were associated with lower risk of ESBL E. coli in SSIs.

El riesgo de infección posoperatoria del sitio quirúrgico colorrectal es uno de los más altos de cualquier especialidad quirúrgica.El propósito de este estudio fue determinar la incidencia, el costo de las infecciones después de la cirugía colorrectal y el beneficio económico potencial del uso del cierre de la herida con antimicrobianos para mejorar los resultados de los pacientes.Análisis retrospectivo de cohorte observacional y análisis de costo probabilístico.El análisis utilizó la base de datos para pacientes colorrectales en los Estados Unidos entre 2014 y 2018.Un total de 107,665 pacientes sometidos a cirugía colorrectal.Se identificó una tasa de infección entre 3 y 180 días después de la operación, los factores de riesgo de infección, los costos de infección durante 24 meses posteriores a la operación por tipo de pagador (pagadores comerciales y Medicare), y los costos potenciales evitados por paciente utilizando una tecnología innovadora de cierre de heridas basada en evidencias.Infecciones del sitio quirúrgico, diagnosticadas postoperatoriamente en el 23,9% de los pacientes (4,0% incisional superficial y 19,9% incisional profunda / espacio orgánico). Los factores de riesgo aumentaron significativamente el riesgo de infección profunda por incisión / espacio orgánico e incluyeron comorbilidades selectivas del paciente, edad, tipo de pagador y tipo de admisión. Después de 12 meses, el aumento de los costos asociados con las infecciones varió de $ 36,429 a $ 144,809 para los pagadores comerciales y de $ 17,551 a $ 102,280 para Medicare, según el tipo de infección del sitio quirúrgico. Los costos incrementales ajustados continuaron aumentando durante un período de estudio de 24 meses para ambos pagadores. Se prevé que el uso del cierre antimicrobiano de la herida para la cirugía colorrectal reducirá significativamente los costos medios del pagador en $ 809- $ 1,170 por paciente en comparación con el cierre tradicional de la herida.Los sesgos inherentes asociados a las bases de datos retrospectivas limitaron este estudio.Se encontró que la carga del costo de la infección del sitio quirúrgico es mayor que la reportada previamente, y los costos del pagador aumentaron durante un período postoperatorio de 24 meses. Los resultados del análisis de costos para la adopción del cierre de heridas antimicrobianas se alinean con estudios previos basados en evidencia, lo que sugiere un beneficio fiscal para su uso como componente de un paquete integral de atención quirúrgica basada en evidencia para reducir el riesgo de infección.

Three groups were defined: those with 0, 1, or 2+ modifiable comorbidities, with associations described for each specific comorbid condition. Primary outcomes included surgical site occurrences, surgical site infections, and surgical site occurrences requiring procedural intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 3,908 subjects met the inclusion criteria.

Compared with having no modifiable comorbidities, having 1 modifiable comorbidity, or 2+ modifiable comorbidities significantly increased the odds of a surgical site occurrence (odds ratios 1.33 and 1.61, respectively). However, only patients with 2+ modifiable comorbidities had significantly increased odds of surgical site occurrences requiring procedural intervention compared with no modifiable comorbidities and 1 modifiable comorbidity (odds ratios 2.02 and 1.65, respectively). Patients with all 3 comorbidities had a two-fold increase in odds for all wound morbidity, followed similarly by obese patients with diabetes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The presence of any number of comorbidities (1 modifiable comorbidity or 2+ modifiable comorbidities) increases the odds for wound events. However, having multiple comorbidities was associated with more procedural interventions for wound management.

The key factor of sepsis-associated brain injury is inflammatory mediators, pathogen and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs, DAMPs) release. Theoretically, blood purification may be beneficial for patients with primary brain injury due to its possibility for fast removal of inflammatory mediators.\n    \n\n\n          Case presentation:\n        \n      \n      We report on six post-neurosurgery septic shock patients treated with combined blood purification (CBP), which included CRRT with high adsorption capacity membrane in combination with CytoSorb adsorber. Clinical improvement in the course of CBP was registered in all patients. Three patients had a stable clinical improvement; the other three patients had only a transient improvement due to underlying neurological and cardiac deficits aggravation. We observed septic shock reversal in four patients. The key observations of the case series are a significant decrease in MOF severity (measured by SOFA score) and in catecholamine need (not statistically significant). By the end of CBP we observed a significant decrease in blood lactate, PCT and IL-6 levels. Two patients demonstrated level of consciousness increase in the setting of CBP therapy measured by GCS and FOUR score.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This case series demonstrates that CBP therapy may have a role for septic shock patients with primary brain injury."

            "abstract": "Spontaneous pneumothorax in apparently healthy individuals is a relatively common occurrence. The management of patients with spontaneous pneumothorax remains controversial. With the advances in thoracoscopic techniques and instrumentation, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is now accepted by many as the procedure of choice for surgical treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax. We report our combined experience with 757 patients who suffered from recurrent or persistent spontaneous pneumothorax treated by VATS over a 5-year period. Surgical indications included persistent air leak (n = 165), recurrence (n = 325), radiologically demonstrated huge bulla (n = 12), spontaneous hemopneumothorax (n = 13), incomplete expansion of the lung (n = 212), and bilateral involvement (n = 30). Several surgical procedures were undertaken, based on the thoracoscopic findings: endoscopic stapled bullectomy (n = 312), argon beam coagulation (n = 6), endoscopic suturing (n = 52), and endoloop ligation (n = 352). In 49 cases, mechanical or chemical pleurodesis was the only procedure performed. There were no mortalities or intraoperative hazards. Complications consisted of wound infections (n = 16), localized empyema (n = 2), chest wall bleeding (n = 1), and persistent air leaks (bulla type III) (n = 31). The median duration of the operation was 55 minutes (15-160 minutes), and the average postoperative hospital stay was 4.5 days (range 0-27 days). There were 16 recurrences (2.1%), after a mean follow-up of 30 months (range 1-60 months). Seven patients had recurrence from 9 to 17 months after stapled bullectomy. All the remaining patients had recurrence after failed pleurodesis. On the basis of our results, we conclude that video-assisted thoracoscopic management allows effective, safe performance of standard surgical procedures, avoiding a formal thoracotomy incision. We consider thoracoscopy the treatment of choice for patients with pneumothorax requiring surgical therapy."

Wound evaluation through tele-follow-up was on par with the outpatient department (OPD) follow-up as no patient had to report to OPD for wound infection. Satisfaction level was excellent in 55% of patients and very good in 25%. 20% of the patients reported an average satisfaction level. If all of these 107 patients would have come to our OPD follow-up, they would have traveled 613.2 miles (908 km) per patient on an average, apart from losing work hours.

Bacterial sedimentation was evaluated during 76 clean urological laparotomies; in 34 of these, a mobile LAF unit was added. During each operation, settle plates were placed at four points in the operating theatre (one at the patient area and three at the perimeter), a nitrocellulose membrane was placed on the instrument table and an additional membrane near the wound. During four operations, particle counting was performed to detect particles > or =0.5 microm. Mean bacterial sedimentation on the nitrocellulose membrane on the instrument table was 2730 cfu/m(2)/h under standard ventilation conditions, whereas it decreased significantly to a mean of 305 cfu/m(2)/h when the LAF unit was used, i.e. within the suggested limit for ultraclean operating theatres (P=0.0001). The membrane near the wound showed a bacterial sedimentation of 4031 cfu/m(2)/h without the LAF unit and 1608 cfu/m(2)/h with the unit (P=0.0001). Particle counts also showed a reduction when the LAF unit was used. No significant difference was found at the four points in the operating theatre between samplings performed with, and without, the LAF unit. Use of a mobile LAF unit with turbulent air ventilation can reduce bacterial contamination at the surgical area in high-risk operations (e.g. prosthesis implant)."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Surgery in patients with head and neck cancers is frequently complicated by multiple stages of procedure that includes significant surgical removal of all or part of an organ with cancer, tissue reconstruction, and extensive neck dissection. Postoperative wound infections, termed 'surgical site infections' (SSIs) are a significant impediment to head-and-neck cancer surgery and recovery, and need to be addressed. Areas covered: Approximately 10-45% of patients undergoing head-and-neck cancers surgery develop SSIs. SSIs can lead to delayed wound healing, increased morbidity and mortality as well as costs. Consequently, SSIs need to be avoided where possible, as even the surgery itself impacts on patients' subsequent activities and their quality of life, which is exacerbated by SSIs. Several risk factors for SSIs need to be considered to reduce future rates, and care is also needed in the selection and duration of antibiotic prophylaxis. Expert commentary: Head and neck surgeons should give personalized care especially to patients at high risk of SSIs. Such patients include those who have had chemoradiotherapy and need reconstructive surgery, and patients from lower and middle-income countries and from poorer communities in high income countries, who often have high levels of co-morbidity because of resource constraints."

Minor complications occurred in five patients, including one case of local wound infection, one case of persistent pain at the gastrostomy site, and three cases of peristomal leakage. These minor complications occurred in 22% of those who underwent percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement and 16% of those who underwent surgical gastrostomy. There was a higher incidence of minor complications in those who underwent gastrostomy for gastrointestinal decompression than in those who underwent the procedure for nutritional supplementation (14% versus 3.5%). A prior history of fistula formation did not predispose to complications related to gastrostomy placement. After gastrostomy tube removal, rapid closure of the site occurred in 96%. No cases of gastrocutaneous fistula formation occurred during follow-up, which ranged from 45 days to 8.7 yr (mean = 2.6 yr).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We conclude that gastrostomy placement is safe in patients with Crohn's disease and does not result in an increased incidence of peristomal disease or formation of prolonged gastrocutaneous fistulas after gastrostomy tube removal."

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is widely used in various medical specialities; its effectiveness in obstetrics however remains the topic of debate-used predominantly as an adjunct to secondary intention specific to high-risk patient groups. Its application in the treatment of actively infected wounds post-Cesarean is not well documented. Here, we document NPWT in the treatment of an unusually severe case of bacterial cellulitis with abdominal abscess postpartum. We provide a unique photographic timeline of wound progression following major surgical debridement, documenting the effectiveness of 2 different NPWT systems (RENASYS GO and PICO, Smith & Nephew). We report problems encountered using these NPWT systems and \"ad-hoc\" solutions to improve efficacy and patient experience.A 34-year-old primiparous Caucasian female with no prior history or risk factors for infection and a normal body mass index (BMI) presented with severe abdominal pain, swelling, and extensive abdominal redness 7 days postemergency Cesarean section. Examination revealed extensive cellulitis with associated abdominal abscess. Staphylococcus aureus was identified in wound exudates and extensive surgical debridement undertaken day 11 postnatally due to continued febrile episodes and clinical deterioration, despite aggressive intravenous antibiotic therapy. Occlusive NPWT dressings were applied for a period of 3 weeks before discharge, as well as a further 5 weeks postdischarge into the community.NPWT was well tolerated and efficacious in infection clearance and wound healing during bacterial cellulitis. Wound healing averaged 1 cm per week before NPWT withdrawal; cessation of NPWT before full wound closure resulted in significantly reduced healing rate, increased purulent discharges, and skin irritation, highlighting the efficacy of NPWT. Five-month follow-up in the clinic found the wound to be fully healed with no additional scarring beyond the boundaries of the original Cesarean incision. The patient was pleased with treatment outcomes, reporting no lasting pain or discomfort from the scar.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This report represents the first documented use of NPWT to aid healing of an actively infected, open wound following extensive surgical debridement 10 days post-Cesarean section, confirming both the efficacy and tolerability of NPWT for the treatment of severe bacterial cellulitis in obstetric debridement."

Statistical analysis was performed using χ2 test along with a two-sample unpaired t-test for continuous variables.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were no significant demographic differences (age, sex, risk factors for wound complication) between the two high-risk groups. In low-risk controls, the major wound complication rate was 4.8% (involving one infection in 21 incisions), resulting in a 3.8-day LOS, 4.8% reoperation, 4.8% readmission rate, and $17,599 in average variable cost. For high-risk controls, there was a significant increase in major wound complications to 25% (including all 12 infections in 60 incisions), LOS (10.6 days), reoperation (18.3%), readmission (16.7%), and costs ($36,537). Finally, negative pressure therapy significantly reduced major wound complications to 8.5% (including five of six infections in 59 incisions; P < .001), reoperation (8.5%; P < .05), and readmission (6.8%; P < .04) but not LOS (10.6 days). The average variable cost was reduced ($30,492), yielding an average savings of $6045 per patient (P = .11).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study suggests that negative pressure therapy significantly reduces the major wound complication, reoperation, and readmission rates for patients at high risk for groin wound complications. Furthermore, this therapy may lead to a reduction in hospital costs. Negative pressure therapy for all groin incisions considered at high risk for wound complications is recommended."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Numerous studies have described various complications after endoprosthetic reconstructive operations. However, there are limited reports that focus specifically on deep infections (e.g., deep incisional surgical site infections), which remain one of the most dreaded complications of these operations, with rates ranging from 10% to 17%. Thus, this study was undertaken to determine the deep infection rates and to analyze possible risk factors, clinico-pathologic characteristics, and treatment modalities of endoprosthetic infections.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We reviewed retrospectively the records of 105 consecutive patients who underwent endoprosthesis replacements from January 2007 to September 2011, with a minimal follow-up period of 32 mo. Comparison was made between patients with and without endoprosthetic infections.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Thirteen of the 150 patients (12.38%) who underwent endoprosthetic operations developed deep infections. Ninety-seven (92.4%) patients presented with a primary bone/soft tissue tumor, 5 (4.8%) with bone metastasis, and 3 (2.9%) with non-tumor conditions. Distal femoral was the most common implant location (42%). The majority of the infections (6/13) occurred within 3 mo post-operation. An elevated C-reactive protein concentration or erythrocyte sedimentation rate were present consistently in all patients at time of diagnosis, whereas clinical presentations and leukocytosis were inconsistent in determining infection. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were the most common organisms isolated, with high numbers demonstrating methicillin-resistance. Overall, multi-drug resistance was noted in 52.6% of the isolated strains. Four risk factors were associated independently with deep infection by multivariable analysis (p<0.05) and these were proximal tibia endoprosthesis, pelvic endoprosthesis, pre-operative duration of hospitalization of more than 48 h, and additional surgical procedures performed after the initial endoprosthetic insertion. Overall, infection was eradicated successfully in 53.8% (7/13) of the patients. Two-stage revision successfully treated the infection in 80% (4/5) of the patients, whereas surgical debridement without a change of implant was successful in only 42.8% (3/7) of patients. Amputation was performed in three patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Patients undergoing endoprosthetic replacement for various orthopedic oncologic conditions have high infection rates. The present study allows early identification of such patients in view of the high morbidity associated with this condition. This report also highlights the high rate of multi-drug-resistant infections, especially methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus and CoNS encountered, which complicates further the management of these patients."

            "abstract": "The number of foreign bodies remaining in the patient after a surgical procedure is presumably higher than mentioned in the literature. According to US insurance statistics, the incidence amounts to 1 in 1,500 surgical procedures. As a basic principle--also from the legal aspect--it is necessary to determine whether a foreign body was left in situ accidentally (i.e. due to a material fault) or if it was simply forgotten. In 70% of cases, fabric items (e.g. swabs etc.) are left behind, while around 30% are metal objects. A particularly high risk is seen in emergency settings, in unexpected changes in the surgical procedure, or for patients with a high body mass index. The outcome for the patient differs depending on the nature of the object left behind and the individual patient's situation. Usually, metal items cause more acute clinical symptoms at an earlier time after the operation. Fabric items tend to induce, in the absence of primary contamination, a chronic progression of symptoms over several years. Reoperation has a high mortality (between 11% and 35%). Precautions in terms of risk management have to be established and need to be strictly respected, especially in high risk settings. Visually or acoustically controlled monitoring before wound-closure are recommended to eliminate \"human error\" as thoroughly as possible."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Two previous meta-analyses comparing staples versus sutures have led to conflicting relative risks for surgical site infection between skin closure methods after orthopaedic surgery. Consequently, the choice of sutures or staples for skin closure continues to be a subject of conversation. Recently, additional randomized trials have been published, and an updated meta-analysis is needed to inform this debate.\n    \n\n\n          Questions/purposes:\n        \n      \n      To determine using a meta-analysis of randomized trials (1) whether there is a difference in surgical site infection (SSI) between staples and sutures for skin closure after orthopaedic surgery, and (2) whether that finding remains the same when the analysis is limited to randomized trials with a low risk of bias.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing staples with sutures for skin closure after orthopaedic surgery was conducted. We excluded barbed sutures, surgical zippers, and skin adhesives from this meta-analysis. Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Global Index Medicus were searched from date of inception to October 18, 2017. The sole outcome of interest was SSI as defined by the original study authors, with preference given to Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions whenever possible, recognizing that this may result in the pooling of more common minor events with rarer, more severe events, and in so doing, overestimate between-group differences. Because of this, subgroup analysis was planned based on severity of infection. Relative risk was calculated using a random-effects model (relative risk [RR], 95% confidence interval [CI]). Heterogeneity was estimated using I. Publication bias was explored using visual inspection of the funnel plot and Egger's test. Subgroup analysis was planned for type of orthopaedic surgery, suture material, SSI category, and country development index. Subgroup interaction p values were calculated. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess study quality. Sensitivity analysis was planned to assess whether the results changed when the analysis was limited to studies with low risk of bias. In total, 17 RCTs (2446 patients) were eligible, of which five RCTs (501 patients) were at low risk of bias.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the primary analysis, patients randomized to staples had a higher risk of SSI versus those who received sutures for skin closure (RR, 2.05; 95% CI,1.38-3.06; I = 0%). However, most of the events were driven by superficial SSI, and only two deep infections were explicitly reported in total (one in each group). After a post-hoc sensitivity analysis excluded a highly influential trial with high risk of bias, the results were highly fragile, relying on a difference of only four additional events in the staples group. When we limited the analysis to RCTs with low risk of bias, no difference was found between sutures and staples in terms of SSI (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.31-6.79; I = 46%). Effect sizes were consistent across subgroups (p value for subgroup interaction was not significant for elective versus trauma; hip versus knee arthroplasty; suture material; high versus middle- versus low-income settings).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Even in this relatively large meta-analysis, existing RCTs do not provide definitive evidence of a difference in SSI risk when staples are used instead of sutures for skin closure after orthopaedic surgery. Currently, the total body of evidence remains weak and, even when limiting to only low risk of bias studies, it is not possible to rule in or rule out clinically important differences between staples and sutures. Until randomized studies of adequate power and followup duration are performed to definitively inform this issue, the choice between staples versus sutures should be based on other factors such as local availability, surgeon preference, and cost.\n    \n\n\n          Level of evidence:\n        \n      \n      Level I, therapeutic study."

            "abstract": "The Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in significant and unprecedented shifts in the delivery of health care services in the United States. Although wound care remains an essential service during the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial consequences and infectious disease ramifications of the pandemic have resulted in closure or limitation of hours in many outpatient wound and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) centers. As HBOT patients often require daily treatment sessions for a period of months, it is necessary for facilities providing HBOT services to adjust to the COVID-19 pandemic while still maintaining availability of this important service. Modification of HBOT session timing and chamber decontamination procedures, utilisation of telehealth services for initial patient evaluations, and acceptance of novel patient populations and diagnoses are mechanisms by which HBOT centers can adapt to the evolving model of health care delivery throughout a pandemic. While COVID-19 is not a currently accepted indication for HBOT, patients may be referred for HBOT consultation due to the post-infectious sequelae of the virus, and thus HBOT facilities must be aware of the potential uses of this treatment for post-viral complications. By redefining paradigms for health care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, HBOT and wound centers can continue to provide high-quality and uninterrupted care to vulnerable patient populations."

            "title": "Preventing surgical site infection. Where now?",
            "abstract": "Surgical site infection (SSI) is increasingly recognised as a measure of the quality of patient care by surgeons, infection control practitioners, health planners and the public. There is increasing pressure to compare SSI rates between surgeons, institutions and countries. For this to be meaningful, data must be standardised and must include post-discharge surveillance (PDS) as many superficial SSIs do not present to the original institution. Further work is required to determine the best method of conducting PDS. In 2008 two important documents on SSI were published from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America/The Infectious Disease Society of America and the National Institute for Health and Clincal Excellence, UK. Both emphasise key aspects during the preoperative, operative and postoperative phases of patient care. In addition to effective interventions known to be important for some time, e.g. not shaving the surgical site until the day of the procedure, there is increasing emphasis on physiological parameters, e.g. blood glucose concentrations, oxygen tensions and body temperature. Laparoscopic procedures are increasingly associated with reduced SSI rates, and the screening and decontamination of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus carriers is effective for certain surgical procedures but has to be balanced by cost and the risk of mupirocin resistance. Finally, there is a need to convert theory into practice by the rigorous application of SSI healthcare bundles. Recent studies suggest that, with a multidisciplinary approach, simple measures can be effective in reducing SSI rates."

We sought to investigate the natural history of incision disturbances with a focus on the patient experience and resource utilization. We hypothesize that patients who have an incision disturbance consume frequent healthcare resources in the post-operative period despite the fact that most never receive a diagnosis of SSI.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A 24-month prospective observational study was undertaken at an academic institution. Patients undergoing elective colorectal operation by two board-certified colorectal surgeons were followed prospectively for 90 days. Incisions were photographed serially and clinically characterized beginning as early as post-operative day two and at follow-up visits. The primary outcome was patient concern for an incision disturbance. Three surgeons reviewed clinical data and photographs to determine the presence of an incisional surgical infection, and diagnosis required agreement from two of three surgeons.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were 171 patients included; 31 (15%) sought evaluation from a healthcare provider for concerns related to their incision including 46 telephone calls, six emergency department visits, seven primary care visits, 10 home health and 40 surgical clinic visits. Incision erythema and drainage were the most common sources of patient concern. Mean body mass index was higher in patients with concern for incision disturbances (34 vs. 28 kg/m2, p < 0.0001). Ultimately, 8% (14/171) received a diagnosis of SSI by study criteria while only 2% (4/171) were captured as having an SSI by the institutional National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (p < 0.0001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Patients undergoing colorectal surgical procedures commonly are concerned with post-operative incision disturbance, yet few are associated with a diagnosis of SSI, and in-person evaluation yields frequent utilization of healthcare resources.

Additionally, clinical studies describing the factors that are associated with persistent infection after nonoperative treatment with antibiotics for patients with superficial SSIs are lacking.\n    \n\n\n          Questions/purposes:\n        \n      \n      Therefore, we asked: (1) What proportion of patients with superficial SSIs after open fracture treatment developed persistent infection after nonoperative treatment (that is, treatment with antibiotics alone)? (2) What risk factors are associated with SSIs that do not resolve with nonoperative (antibiotic) treatment? As a secondary objective, we planned to analyze the microbiological information about participants wound cultures, when these were available, and the proportion of positive cultures for patients whose SSIs were not resolved by antibiotics alone.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This is a secondary analysis of the Fluid Lavage of Open Wounds (FLOW) trial dataset. The FLOW trial included 2445 patients with operatively managed open fractures. FLOW participants who had a nonoperatively managed superficial SSI diagnosed in the 12 months post-fracture were included in this analysis. Superficial SSIs were diagnosed in 168 participants within 12 months of their fracture. Of these, 83% (139) had their superficial SSI treated with antibiotics alone. Participants were grouped into two categories: (1) 97 participants whose treatment with antibiotics alone resolved the superficial SSI and (2) 42 participants whose treatment with antibiotics alone did not resolve the SSI (defined as undergoing surgical management or the SSI being unresolved at latest follow-up [12-months post-fracture for the FLOW trial]). Of the participants whose treatment with antibiotics alone resolved the SSI, 92% (89 of 97) had complete follow-up, 6% (6 of 97) were lost to follow-up before 12 months, 1% (1 of 97) withdrew consent from the study before 12 months, and 1% (1 of 97) experienced mortality before 12 months. Of the participants whose treatment with antibiotics alone did not resolve the SSI, 90% (38 of 42) had complete follow-up, 7% (3 of 42) were lost to follow-up before 12 months, and 2% (1 of 42) withdrew consent from the study before 12 months. A logistic binary regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with persistent infection despite superficial SSI antibiotic treatment. Based on biologic rationale and previous evidence, we identified a priori 13 potential factors (corresponding to 14 levels) to be included in the regression model.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The antibiotic treatment resolved the superficial SSI in 70% (97 of 139) of patients and did not resolve the SSI in 30% (42 of 139). After controlling for potential confounding variables, such as age, fracture severity, and time from injury to initial surgical irrigation and débridement, superficial SSIs diagnosed later in follow-up were associated with antibiotics not resolving the SSI (odds ratio 1.05 [95% CI 1.004 to 1.009] for every week of follow-up; p = 0.03). Sex, fracture pattern, and wound size were not associated with antibiotics not resolving the SSI.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our secondary analysis of prospectively collected FLOW data suggests that antibiotics alone can be an appropriate treatment option when treating superficial SSIs after an open fracture wound, especially when promptly diagnosed.

Studies conducted both in the UK and US have documented an additional risk associated with operative vaginal delivery. However, a Cochrane review, updated in 2017, identified only one small trial of prophylactic antibiotics following operative vaginal delivery, which included a total of 393 women. Given the small size of that trial, it recommended that further robust evidence is needed. Operative vaginal delivery rates vary worldwide, but typically 5-10% of women have operative vaginal births. A conservative estimated incidence of maternal infection following operative vaginal delivery is 4%, based on the one previous trial. There is, therefore, considerable scope for direct patient benefit from an effective preventive strategy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This protocol describes a multicentre, randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trial aiming to recruit 3424 participants from over 20 hospital sites in the UK.

The preventable and the unmodifiable risk factors for deep sternal wound infections (DSWI) have been amply assessed in the literature. The aim of this review was to describe the results of the numerous published studies to describe all the DSWI risk factors and the scales devised to predict SWI, with a view to providing an update on this issue. A comprehensive search of the Medline and Embase databases was performed (considering studies from January 1995 to April 2011); and a manual search was also conducted using references cited in original publications and relevant review articles. There are several risk factors associated with DSWI, which could be classified in four categories as demographic (e.g. sex and age), behavioural (e.g. smoking and obesity), baseline clinical conditions (e.g. diabetes, hypertension and COPD) and surgical operative risk factors (e.g. duration of operation and emergency operation). Six scales for predicting the risk of DSWI are described in the literature: they vary not only in accuracy but also in ease of application and they are applied at different times (some only preoperatively and others also postoperatively). This study provides a broad update on our knowledge of the risk factors for DSWI and the scales for prediction with a view to improving the management of infections at cardiosurgery units."

We included consecutive adults with GNPOM in two centres between 2005 and 2014. Patients receiving combined systemic and IT/IV treatment were matched to patients receiving systemic treatment only. Matching was done based on the propensity of the patients to receive IT/IV treatment. We compared patient groups with 30-day mortality defined as the primary outcome. The cohort included 95 patients with GNPOM. Of them, 37 received IT/IV therapy in addition to systemic treatment (22 with colistin and 15 with amikacin), mostly as initial therapy, through indwelling cerebrospinal fluid drains. Variables associated with IT/IV therapy in the propensity score included no previous neurosurgery, time from admission to meningitis, presence of a urinary catheter and GNPOM caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Following propensity matching, 23 patients given IT/IV therapy and 27 controls were analysed. Mortality was significantly lower with IT/IV therapy: 2/23 (8.7%) versus 9/27 (33.3%), propensity-adjusted OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.99.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      In the perioperative period, dexamethasone is widely and effectively used for prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), for pain management, and to facilitate early discharge after ambulatory surgery.Long-term treatment with steroids has many side effects, such as adrenal insufficiency, increased infection risk, hyperglycaemia, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and development of diabetes mellitus. However, whether a single steroid load during surgery has negative effects during the postoperative period has not yet been studied.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effects of a steroid load of dexamethasone on postoperative systemic or wound infection, delayed wound healing, and blood glucose change in adult surgical patients (with planned subgroup analysis of patients with and without diabetes).\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science for relevant articles on 29 January 2018. We searched without language or date restriction two clinical trial registries to identify ongoing studies, and we handsearched the reference lists of relevant publications to identify all eligible trials.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We searched for randomized controlled trials comparing an incidental steroid load of dexamethasone versus a control intervention for adult patients undergoing surgery. We required that studies include a follow-up of 30 days for proper assessment of the number of postoperative infections, delayed wound healing, and the glycaemic response.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data from relevant studies, and assessed all included studies for bias. We resolved differences by discussion and pooled included studies in a meta-analysis. We calculated Peto odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. Our primary outcomes were postoperative systemic or wound infection, delayed wound healing, and glycaemic response within 24 hours. We created a funnel plot for the primary outcome postoperative (wound or systemic) infection. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included in the meta-analysis 38 studies that included adults undergoing a large variety of surgical procedures (i.e. abdominal surgery, cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, and orthopaedic surgery). Age range of participants was 18 to 80 years. There is probably little or no difference in the risk of postoperative (wound or systemic) infection with dexamethasone compared with no treatment, placebo, or active control (ramosetron, ondansetron, or tropisetron) (Peto OR 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.27; 4931 participants, 27 studies; I² = 27%; moderate-quality evidence). The effects of dexamethasone on delayed wound healing are unclear because the wide confidence interval includes both meaningful benefit and harm (Peto OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.28 to 3.43; 1072 participants, eight studies; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). Dexamethasone may produce a mild increase in glucose levels among participants without diabetes during the first 12 hours after surgery (MD 13 mg/dL, 95% CI 6 to 21; 10 studies; 595 participants; I² = 50%; low-quality evidence). We identified two studies reporting on glycaemic response after dexamethasone in participants with diabetes within 24 hours after surgery (MD 32 mg/dL, 95% CI 15 to 49; 74 participants; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A single dose of dexamethasone probably does not increase the risk for postoperative infection. It is uncertain whether dexamethasone has an effect on delayed wound healing in the general surgical population owing to imprecision in trial results. Participants with increased risk for delayed wound healing (e.g. participants with diabetes, those taking immunosuppressive drugs) were not included in the randomized studies reporting on delayed wound healing included in this meta-analysis; therefore our findings should be extrapolated to the clinical setting with caution. Furthermore, one has to keep in mind that dexamethasone induces a mild increase in glucose. For patients with diabetes, very limited evidence suggests a more pronounced increase in glucose. Whether this influences wound healing in a clinically relevant way remains to be established. Once assessed, the three studies awaiting classification and two that are ongoing may alter the conclusions of this review."

We conducted retrospective analysis of Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs health data for lower extremity combat-injured patients with (1) unilateral amputation within 90 days postinjury (early amputation, n = 440), (2) unilateral amputation more than 90 days postinjury (late amputation, n = 78), or (3) leg-threatening injuries without amputation (limb salvage, n = 107). Patient medical records were analyzed for four years postinjury. After adjusting for group differences, early amputation was generally associated with a lower or similar prevalence for adverse physical and psychological diagnoses (e.g., pain, osteoarthritis, posttraumatic stress disorder) versus late amputation and/or limb salvage. By contrast, early amputation was associated with an increased likelihood of osteoporosis during the first year postinjury. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder increased for all patient groups over four years postinjury, particularly in the second year. The different clinical outcomes among combat extremity injured patients treated with early amputation, late amputation, or limb salvage highlight their different healthcare requirements. These findings can inform and optimize the specific treatment pathways that address the physical and psychological healthcare needs of such patients over time."

Historically, knees with such complications have been salvaged with use of an arthrodesis or amputation. The purpose of this study was to assess the survival and functional outcomes of a 2-stage exchange arthroplasty combined with knitted monofilament polypropylene (Marlex; C.R.

Some believe the risk of wound infection and mesh removal in this setting to be unacceptably high. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nonabsorbable mesh used for hernia repair in the presence of a stoma or at the time of colon resection.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      All patients undergoing elective surgical implantation of mesh with concomitant open bowel from 1987 to 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Computer database identified all patients undergoing parastomal hernia repair, ventral hernia repair with a stoma present, hernia repair with concomitant bowel resection, and colostomy closure with repair of hernia. No patients so identified were excluded. Follow-up was attained on all patients by chart review and telephone survey. The data was statistically analyzed by chi-squared test using a P value of <0.05 for statistical significance.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-nine patients were identified as having undergone 30 elective hernia repairs using nonabsorbable mesh.

Included were 11 patients undergoing parastomal hernia repair (37 percent), 14 patients undergoing ventral hernia repair in the setting of open bowel (47 percent), and 5 patients in whom mesh repair of ventral and parastomal hernias were performed simultaneously (16 percent). Hernias recurred in 13 patients (43 percent). Overall recurrence for mesh repair at a parastomal site was 63 percent; overall recurrence at an incisional hernia site was 21 percent. The risk of wound complications after mesh placement in the setting of open bowel was assessed. Wound seromas developed after surgery in four patients (13 percent). Seromas were all treated successfully by aspiration. Wound infections occurred after surgery in two patients (7 percent). Wound infection occurred exclusively in sites of parastomal repair representing 2 of 16 (13 percent) of parastomal hernia sites.

            "abstract": "Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most common healthcare-associated infections, and contribute significantly to patient morbidity and healthcare costs. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common microbial cause. The epidemiology of S. aureus is changing with the dissemination of newer clones and the emergence of mupirocin resistance. The prevention and control of SSIs is multi-modal, and this article reviews the evidence on the value of screening for nasal carriage of S. aureus and subsequent decolonization of positive patients pre-operatively. Pre-operative screening, using culture- or molecular-based methods, and subsequent decolonization of patients who are positive for meticillin-susceptible S. aureus and meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) reduces SSIs and hospital stay. This applies especially to major clean surgery, such as cardiothoracic and orthopaedic, involving the insertion of implanted devices. However, it requires a multi-disciplinary approach coupled with patient education. Universal decolonization pre-operatively without screening for S. aureus may compromise the capacity to monitor for the emergence of new clones of S. aureus, contribute to mupirocin resistance, and prevent the adjustment of surgical prophylaxis for MRSA (i.e. replacement of a beta-lactam agent with a glycopeptide or alternative)."

This study aimed to investigate the incidence rate after surgery of hip fractures in the elderly and to identify the associated risk factors. Patients: Patients' demographic, injury, and surgery-related data and biochemical indexes were retrospectively reviewed and recorded during their hospitalization, between July 2015 and June 2017. After their discharge from hospital, patients were prospectively followed up at postoperative 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. SSIs were identified by review of patients' medical records and post-discharge telephone follow-up. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the independent risk factors associated with SSI. Results: A total of 611 patients undergoing surgery for hip fractures with complete data were included for analysis. During the postoperative one year, 27 SSIs (19 superficial and 8 deep SSIs) developed, indicating the cumulative incidence of 4.4% (95%CI, 2.8-6.0%). Of them, 21 (77.8%) SSIs were detected during patients' hospitalization, and the 6 (22.2%) cases were confirmed via telephone during the post-discharge follow-up. After adjustment of multiple variables, BMI, current smoking, surgical duration, preoperative hospital stay, ASA class of III-IV, ALB <35g/L, and FBG > 110mg/dL were identified as independent risk factors for SSI. Conclusions: Three modifiable factors as smoking, preoperative ALB <35g/L, and FBG > 110mg/dL should be optimized preoperatively to reduce the SSIs. Other factors, although not modifiable, could be used for screening of at-risk patients, patient risk stratification, or for counseling of patients."

Results showed that infection rates for C. difficile increased whereas rates for orthopaedic surgical site infections (SSIs) decreased. Both types of infection were more common in older female patients and in patients with greater comorbidity, but showed little difference in rates between areas with varying deprivation scores. For 2004 and 2005, we compared the HES data with mandatory reporting data from the Health Protection Agency (HPA). This showed recording of C. difficile infection to be higher from HPA data than from HES data. In contrast, compared with HPA data for orthopaedic SSIs, there were many more SSIs and numbers of procedures recorded from HES data for all four orthopaedic procedures, although the infection rates themselves were broadly similar. These findings reflect the limitations of both methods used and we suggest that there is a case for using both sources of information, either independently or linked at an individual level in order to obtain a more complete picture of these important healthcare-associated infections.

Sternal wound complications also carry significant economic burden, almost tripling patients' hospital costs and are considered a nonreimbursable \"never event\" for Medicare. Historically, SDD and SWI have been recognized as discrete entities, but nonetheless continue to be categorized as a singular complication in literature. The purpose of this study was to determine specific patient demographic and perioperative predictors of SSD and SWI.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      An institutional review board-approved, retrospective study of 8098 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery at Columbia University Medical Center between January 2008 and December 2013 was conducted. Patients were categorized into three groups: no sternal wound complication, SSD, or SWI. Statistical analysis was performed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 8098 patients, there were 73 patients (0.9%) with SSD and 40 (0.5%) with SWI who required plastic surgical consultation, debridement, and flap closure. In univariate analysis of SSD, positive predictors (i.e., \"risk\" factors) were age >42 years, prior surgery this admission, ≥2 arterial conduits, internal mammary artery (IMA) grafting with or without previous IMA grafting, body mass index (BMI) >30 (obese), CHF, diabetes requiring medication, respiratory failure, and unplanned cardiac reoperation; negative predictors (i.e., \"protective\" factors) were no arterial conduits and extubation within 24 h. In univariate analysis of SWI, positive predictors were IMA grafting with or without previous IMA grafting, postoperative hematocrit urgent/emergent surgical priority, BMI >30 (obese), cardiac ejection fraction <40%, and respiratory failure; negative predictors were no arterial conduits and elective surgical priority. In multivariate regression, BMI >30, diabetes requiring medication, and respiratory failure were determined to be significant positive predictors of SSD, and IMA grafting with or without prior IMA grafting and respiratory failure were significant positive predictors for SWI; no significant negative predictors were identified.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study found that SSD and SWI have many common significant predictors consistent with findings that increased BMI, use of IMA grafts, poor cardiac reserve, and postoperative respiratory failure confer increased risk of sternal wound complications. Additionally, this study also found that there were predictors unique to each entity supporting that SSD and SWI may be related but are not a singular entity. Recognition and prevention of significant positive and negative predictors of SSD and SWI may be valuable in preoperative counseling, operative planning, and postoperative management. Although sternal wound complications can be successfully managed by plastic surgical intervention, preventing the development of median sternotomy complications may curb costs incurred by both patients and health care systems."

Key challenges exist in understanding the data for robust clinical decision-support. Limitations of traditional methodologies to handle these data led to the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI). This article emphasizes the capabilities of AI to identify patterns of SSI data. Method: Artificial intelligence comprises various subfields that present potential solutions to identify patterns of SSI data. Discussions on opportunities, challenges, and limitations of applying these methods to derive accurate SSI prediction are provided. Results: Four main challenges in dealing with SSI data were defined: (1) complexities in using SSI data, (2) disease knowledge, (3) decision support, and (4) heterogeneity. The implications of some of the recent advances in AI methods to optimize clinical effectiveness were discussed. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence has the potential to provide insight in detecting and decision-support of SSI. As we turn SSI data into intelligence about the disease, we increase the possibility of improving surgical practice with the promise of a future optimized for the highest quality patient care."

Univariate analysis compared responses to the multiple-choice questions and qualitative content analysis evaluated open-ended responses.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 442 enrolled patients, 289 completed their postoperative visit and were sent surveys (55% response rate). Patients were categorized as VV (n = 135), crossover (randomized to virtual but completed in-person; n = 53), and in-person visits (n = 101). Patient-reported satisfaction was similar, but convenience was higher for VV patients. Open-ended responses (72 VVs, 14 crossovers, and 41 in-person visits) were qualitatively analyzed. In all groups, patient experience was influenced by quality of care, efficiency, and convenience. Barriers were different for virtual and in-person appointments.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found that quality of, and access to, care-whether in person or virtual-remained critical components of patient satisfaction. VVs address many barriers associated with in-person visits and were more convenient, but can present additional technological barriers."

A prospective incidence study has been promoted in a Thoracic Surgery in the years 2000, 2001, 2002. The analysis has been lead weekly gathering all necessary data from the health records and making laboratory tests to look for microbes growth in the air of Thoracic Surgery Operating Rooms. A nosocomial infections incidence of 13.3% among surgically treated patients has been registered in 2000. Deep surgical site infections were the most frequent localizations, and microbes isolated were Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus with an high oxacillin resistance (70.6%-76.5%). From the observation of the risk factors the sterilization system has been modified and the assistance and environmental protocols have been improved. In the further evaluation period, a global reduction of nosocomial infections incidence (7.1%), of surgical site infections (from 10.1% to 4.5%) (p = 0.007), of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus isolations have been obtained even if short results in antibiotic resistances have been registered. Thoracic Surgery has to be considered an area at medium-high risk of nosocomial infections. The quite high incidence of nosocomial infections recorded at the beginning of the study in presence of prevalent deep surgical site infections from staphylococci with an high oxacillin resistance compelled to promote corrections. These lead to a remarkable decrease in incidence of nosocomial infections even if the same results can not be reached in antibiotic resistances."

            "abstract": "Unintentional hypothermia (core temperature < 36 °C) is a common side effect in patients undergoing surgery. Several patient-centred and external factors, e.g., drugs, comorbidities, trauma, environmental temperature, type of anaesthesia, as well as extent and duration of surgery, influence core temperature. Perioperative hypothermia has negative effects on coagulation, blood loss and transfusion requirements, metabolization of drugs, surgical site infections, and discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit. Therefore, active temperature management is required in the pre-, intra-, and postoperative period to diminish the risks of perioperative hypothermia. Temperature measurement should be done with accurate and continuous probes. Perioperative temperature management includes a bundle of warming tools adapted to individual needs and local circumstances. Warming blankets and mattresses as well as the administration of properly warmed infusions via dedicated devices are important for this purpose. Temperature management should follow checklists and be individualized to the patient's requirements and the local possibilities."

A better understanding and reversal of modifiable risk factors may lead to a reduction in the incidence of incisional SSI and PJI. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) recently updated the national Guideline for Prevention of Surgical Site Infection. The updated guideline applies evidence-based methodology, presents recommendations for potential strategies to reduce the risk of SSI, and includes an arthroplasty-specific section. This article serves to introduce the guideline development process and to complement the Prosthetic Joint Arthroplasty section with background information on PJI-specific economic burden, epidemiology, pathogenesis and microbiology, and risk factor information."

However, the additional cost of the surgical enclosure would not be offset by cost savings due to reduced risk of revisions."

Therefore, we set to estimate the total burden of HAIs and antimicrobial use in acute care hospitals in Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, and Colombia using the one-day point prevalence methodology.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The survey was conducted between June and July 2016. In each ward or unit, HAIs and antimicrobial use data were collected on a single day by a trained team of researchers.

            "abstract": "Study areas concerning maximizing knee range of motion (ROM) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have come under focus by surgeons. Among the perioperative factors that were identified to affect ROM after TKAs is knee position during surgical wound closure. Therefore, the aim of this study was to review the impact of knee position during TKA wound closure on: (1) postoperative ROM, (2) wound-related complications, (3) Knee Society Score (KSS), (4) postoperative pain, and (5) muscle strength and home functional recovery. A literature search was performed using PubMed, Ovid, and Google Scholar using various combinations of the following search terms: \"wound closure,\" \"knee position,\" \"surgical closure,\" and \"knee arthroplasty.\" The studies were evaluated for outcomes after TKA and stratified based on the knee position at surgical closure. After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, seven studies were analyzed. The total number of patients included was 516 patients (259 patients in the flexion group and 257 patients in the full extension group). Based on the reviewed literature, wound closure in flexion was associated with significant improvement in ROM recovery at earlier follow-ups after TKA (four positive and three neutral studies), better early postoperative pain scores (two positive and one neutral study), and faster physical recovery (two positive studies) (better muscle strength and early achievement of physical therapy milestones) compared with wound closure in extension. No difference was found between wound closure in flexion compared with closure in extension in terms of long-term ROM recovery, long-term postoperative pain scores, wound-related complications (seven neutral studies), knee function measured by KSS (five neutral studies), or patient satisfactions after TKA. Although the current review is limited by the number of studies that are available in the literature, it demonstrates that overall, compared with extension, surgical wound closure in flexion may provide better ROM, faster recovery, comparable patient satisfaction, and no risk of higher wound complications."

A significant amount of laboratory-based research has been carried out on this topic, however, in 2013 the European Wound Management Association (EWMA) pointed out the lack of guidance for managing biofilms in clinical practice and solicited the need for guidelines and further clinical research. In response to this challenge, the Italian Nursing Wound Healing Society (AISLeC) initiated a project which aimed to achieve consensus among a multidisciplinary and multiprofessional international panel of experts to identify what could be considered part of 'good clinical practice' with respect to the recognition and management of biofilms in acute and chronic wounds. The group followed a systematic approach, developed by the GRADE working group, to define relevant questions and clinical recommendations raised in clinical practice. An independent librarian retrieved and screened approximately 2000 pertinent published papers to produce tables of levels of evidence. After a smaller focus group had a multistep structured discussion, and a formal voting process had been completed, ten therapeutic interventions were identified as being strongly recommendable for clinical practice, while another four recommendations were graded as being 'weak'. The panel subsequently formulated a preliminary statement (although with a weak grade of agreement): 'provided that other causes that prevent optimal wound healing have been ruled out, chronic wounds are chronically infected'. All members of the panel agreed that there is a paucity of reliable, well-conducted clinical trials which have produced clear evidence related to the effects of biofilm presence. In the meantime it was agreed that expert-based guidelines were needed to be developed for the recognition and management of biofilms in wounds and for the best design of future clinical trials. This is a fundamental and urgent task for both laboratory-based scientists and clinicians."

Previous studies report no substantial reduction in the risk of surgical site infection (SSI) after antibiotic prophylaxis, yet are limited in power by low sample sizes and low overall rates of postoperative infection.\n    \n\n\n          Questions/purposes:\n        \n      \n      Is there evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis decreases the risk of SSI after soft tissue hand surgery when using propensity score matching to control for potential confounding variables such as demographics, procedure type, medication use, existing comorbidities, and postoperative events?\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This retrospective analysis used the Truven Health MarketScan databases, large, multistate commercial insurance claims databases corresponding to inpatient and outpatient services and outpatient drug claims made between January 2007 and December 2014. The database includes records for patients enrolled in health insurance plans from self-insured employers and other private payers. Current Procedural Terminology codes were used to identify patients who underwent carpal tunnel release, trigger finger release, ganglion and retinacular cyst excision, de Quervain's release, or soft tissue mass excision, and to assign patients to one of two cohorts based on whether they had received preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. We identified 943,741 patients, of whom 426,755 (45%) were excluded after meeting one or more exclusion criteria: 357,500 (38%) did not have 12 months of consecutive insurance enrollment before surgery or 1 month of enrollment after surgery; 60,693 (6%) had concomitant bony, implant, or incision and drainage or débridement procedures; and 94,141 (10%) did not have complete data. In all, our initial cohort consisted of 516,986 patients, among whom 58,201 (11%) received antibiotic prophylaxis. Propensity scores were calculated and used to create cohorts matched on potential risk factors for SSI, including age, procedure type, recent use of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, diabetes, HIV/AIDs, tobacco use, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, alcohol abuse, malnutrition, history of prior SSI, and local procedure volume. Multivariable logistic regression before and after propensity score matching was used to test whether antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with a decrease in the risk of SSI within 30 days after surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After controlling for patient demographics, hand procedure type, medication use, existing comorbidities (eg, diabetes, HIV/AIDs, tobacco use, obesity), and postoperative events through propensity score matching, we found that the risk of postoperative SSI was no different between patients who had received antibiotic prophylaxis and those who had not (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.93-1.13; p = 0.585).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Antibiotic prophylaxis for common soft tissue procedures of the hand is not associated with reduction in postoperative infection risk. While our analysis cannot account for factors that are not captured in the billing process, this study nevertheless provides strong evidence against unnecessary use of antibiotics before these procedures, especially given the difficulty of conducting a randomized prospective study with a sample size large enough to detect the effect of prophylaxis on the low baseline risk of infection.\n    \n\n\n          Level of evidence:\n        \n      \n      Level III, therapeutic study."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Surgical site infections (SSIs) constitute a major clinical problem in terms of morbidity, mortality, duration of hospital stay, and overall costs. The bacterial pathogens implicated most frequently are Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) SSIs is increasing significantly. Since these infections have a significant impact on hospital budgets and patients' health, their diagnosis must be anticipated and therapy improved. The first step should be to evaluate risk factors for MRSA SSIs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Through a literature review, we identified possible major and minor risk factors for, and protective factors against MRSA SSIs. We then submitted statements on these factors to 228 Italian surgeons to determine, using the Delphi method, the degree of consensus regarding their importance. The consensus was rated as positive if >80% of the voters agreed with a statement and as negative if >80% of the voters disagreed. In other cases, no consensus was reached.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was positive consensus that sepsis, >2 weeks of hospitalization, age >75 years, colonization by MRSA, and diabetes were major risk factors for MRSA SSIs. Other possible major risk factors, on which a consensus was not reached, e.g., prior antibiotic use, were considered minor risk factors. Other minor risk factors were identified. An adequate antibiotic prophylaxis, laparoscopic technique, and infection committee surveillance were considered protective factors against MRSA SSIs. All these factors might be used to build predictive criteria for identifying SSI due to MRSA.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In order to help to recognize and thus promptly initiate an adequate antibiotic therapy for MRSA SSIs, we designed a gradation of risk and protective factors. Validation, ideally prospective, of this score is now required. In the case of a SSI, if the risk that the infection is caused by MRSA is high, empiric antibiotic therapy should be started after debriding the wound and collecting material for culture."

            "abstract": "Background: Surgical site infection (SSI) continues to be a common and costly complication after surgery. The current commonly used definitions of SSI were devised more than two decades ago and do not take in to account more modern technology that could be used to make diagnosis more consistent and precise. Patient-generated health data (PGHD), including digital imaging, may be able to fulfill this objective. Methods: The published literature was examined to determine the current state of development in terms of using digital imaging as an aide to diagnose SSI. This information was used to devise possible methodology that could be used to integrate digital images to more objectively define SSI, as well as using these data for both surveillance activities and clinical management. Results: Digital imaging is a highly promising means to help define and diagnose SSI, particularly in remote settings. Multiple groups continue to actively study these emerging technologies, however, present methods remain based generally on subjective rather than objective observations. Although current images may be useful on a case-by-case basis, similar to physical examination information, integrating imaging in the definition of SSI to allow more automated diagnosis in the future will require complex image analysis combined with other available quantified data. Conclusions: Digital imaging technology, once adequately evolved, should become a cornerstone of the criteria for both the clinical and surveillance definitions of SSI."

A nurse-led quality improvement (QI) team sought to reduce OR traffic through education and a process change that included wireless communication technology and policy development. The team measured OR traffic by counting the frequency of door openings per hour in seven surgical suites during 305 surgical procedures conducted during similar 22-week periods before and after the QI project intervention. Door openings decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from an average of 37.8 per hour to 32.8 per hour after the QI project intervention. This suggests that our multifaceted approach reduces OR traffic. The next steps of this project include analyzing automatically captured video to understand OR traffic patterns and expanding education to departments and external personnel frequently present in our surgical suites.

The objective of this study was to develop a risk prediction model for S. aureus SSI or bacteremia after cardiothoracic surgery based on pre-operative variables.\n    \n\n\n          Materials/methods:\n        \n      \n      Data from the Merck Phase IIb/III S. aureus vaccine (V710-P003) clinical trial were analyzed. In this randomized placebo-controlled trial, the effect of preoperative vaccination against S. aureus was investigated in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. The primary outcome was deep/superficial S. aureus SSI or S. aureus bacteremia through day 90 after surgery. Performance, calibration, and discrimination of the final model were assessed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall 164 out of 7,647 included patients (2.1%) developed S. aureus infection (149 SSI, 15 bacteremia, 28 both). Independent risk factors for developing the primary outcome were pre-operative colonization with S. aureus (OR 3.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.23-4.22), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.34-2.60), BMI (OR 1.02 per kg/m2, 95% CI 0.99-1.05), and CABG (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.91-3.78). Although vaccination had a significant (albeit modest) protective effect, it was omitted from the model because its addition did not significantly change the coefficients of the final model and V710-vaccine development has been discontinued due to insufficient efficacy. The final prediction model had moderate discriminative accuracy (AUC-value, 0.72).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Pre-operative S. aureus colonization status, diabetes mellitus, BMI, and type of surgical procedure moderately predicted the risk of S. aureus SSI and/or bacteremia among patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery."

We evaluated the validity of these observations and identified risk factors that may impact time to initial wound closure.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      Retrospective review and case-control analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Military hospitals.\n    \n\n\n          Patients/participants:\n        \n      \n      US military personnel injured during combat operations (2009-2011).

            "abstract": "Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most prevalent and devastating complications following lower extremity total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Strategies to reduce the rates can be divided into preoperative, perioperatives, and postoperative measures. A multicenter trial is underway to evaluate the efficacy of implementing a bundled care program for SSI prevention in lower extremity TJA including: (1) nasal decolonization; (2) surgical skin antisepsis; (3) antimicrobial incise draping; (4) temperature management; and (5) negative-pressure wound therapy for selected high-risk patients. The purposes of this systematic review were to provide a background and then to summarize the available evidence pertaining to each of these SSI-reduction strategies with special emphasis on total knee arthroplasty. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in accordance with the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement guidelines. Five individual literature searches were performed to identify studies evaluating nasal decolonization temperature management, surgical skin antisepsis, antimicrobial incise draping, and negative-pressure wound therapy. The highest level of evidence reports was used in each product review, and if there were insufficient arthroplasty papers on the particular topic, then papers were further culled from the surgical specialties to form the basis for the review. There was sufficient literature to assess all of the various prophylactic and preventative techniques. All five products used in the bundled program were supported for use as prophylactic agents or for the direct reduction of SSIs in both level I and II studies. This systematic review showed that various pre-, intra-, and postoperative strategies are efficacious in decreasing the risks of SSIs following lower extremity TJA procedures. Thus, including them in the armamentarium for SSI-reduction strategies for hip and knee arthroplasty surgeons should decrease the incidence of infections. We expect that the combined use of these products in an upcoming study will support these findings and may further enhance the reduction of total knee arthroplasty SSIs in a synergistic manner."

Therefore, telemedicine has a long and outstanding tradition in the maritime environment. Since 1931 Cuxhaven medical center (Medico Cuxhaven) operates as a hospital-based radio medical advice center (RMA) for ships worldwide providing one of the first routine telemedical services worldwide. For a long time this task was performed on a honorary basis by the hospital's physicians. In 1994 Germany accepted the IMO/ILO (International Maritime Organisation and International Labour Organisation) solution 164. Therefore, in 1998 a formal contract of the German Ministry of Transport officially installed Medico Cuxhaven as the TMAS Center for Germany. According to IMO/ILO solution 164, the RMA provides an expert level of care 24 h/day, 365 days/year. Cuxhaven hospital is a busy general hospital with departments of anesthesia and intensive care, internal medicine, surgery, gynecology and obstetrics, urology, pediatrics, ENT, radiology, and pain medicine. All physicians directly responding to TMAS calls have practical experience in maritime routine and emergency medicine. All incoming emergency calls are primarily handled by board-certified anesthesiologists, experienced in martime emergency medicine (e. g., staffing coastal SAR helicopters, working on rescue boats, carrying out repatriation services for sailors worldwide). If needed, other medical specialists are included. Today, Medico Cuxhaven takes an average workload of one to two emergency calls (response time < 20 s), two to three follow-up calls and approximately one informative call per day. Since 2000 transmission of digital photos has been used for routine RMA. Recently, a system for online and trenddata telemetry of twelve-lead ECG, NIBP (noninvasive blood pressure measurement), CO(2), SaO(2), pulse and respiration rates including the transmission of video images was developed. This system allows worldwide communications as it is capable of all possible means of telecommunication such as GSM, Inmarsat-ISDN or Iridium-Satellite-Transmission. So far, this system has been installed on board several German SAR rescue boats.However, radio telephone and the simple transmission of digital photography remain the basis of maritime radio medical advice service."

Patients were excluded if they presented more than 72 hours after their injury or were unable to complete questionnaires.\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      Negative-pressure wound therapy (n = 226) where an 'open-cell' solid foam or gauze was placed over the surface of the wound and connected to a suction pump which created a partial vacuum over the dressing versus standard dressings not involving negative pressure (n = 234).\n    \n\n\n          Main outcome measures:\n        \n      \n      Disability Rating Index (DRI) - a score of 0 (no disability) to 100 (completely disabled) at 12 months was the primary outcome measure, with a minimal clinically important difference of 8 points. The secondary outcomes were deep infection, quality of life and resource use collected at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post randomisaton.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was no evidence of a difference in the patients' DRI at 12 months. The mean DRI in the NPWT group was 45.5 points [standard deviation (SD) 28.0 points] versus 42.4 points (SD 24.2 points) in the standard dressing group, giving a difference of -3.9 points (95% confidence interval -8.9 to 1.2 points) in favour of standard dressings (p = 0.132). There was no difference in HRQoL and no difference in the number of surgical site infections or other complications at any point in the 12 months after surgery. NPWT did not reduce the cost of treatment and it was associated with a low probability of cost-effectiveness.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      Owing to the emergency nature of the interventions, we anticipated that some patients who were randomised into the trial would subsequently be unable or unwilling to take part. Such post-randomisation withdrawal of patients could have posed a risk to the external validity of the trial. However, the great majority of these patients (85%) were found to be ineligible after randomisation. Therefore, we can be confident that the patients who took part were representative of the population with severe open fractures of the lower limb.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Contrary to the existing literature and current clinical guidelines, NPWT dressings do not provide a clinical or an economic benefit for patients with an open fracture of the lower limb.\n    \n\n\n          Future work:\n        \n      \n      Future work should investigate alternative strategies to reduce the incidence of infection and improve outcomes for patients with an open fracture of the lower limb. Two specific areas of potentially great benefit are (1) the use of topical antibiotic preparations in the open-fracture wound and (2) the role of orthopaedic implants with antimicrobial coatings when fixing the associated fracture.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN33756652 and UKCRN Portfolio ID 11783.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 22, No. 73.

The identification of patients and procedures that have an increased risk of complications enables the physician to carry out prophylactic measures to reduce the rate of these complications. Venous thromboembolism, hypothermia, bleeding diathesis, and perioperative hypertension are identifiable risks of plastic surgery, which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. An evidence-based system and individual practice measures can help to decrease these risks. Thorough preoperative patient evaluation, detailed informed consent, and perioperative care delivered in a safe environment can contribute to improved safety in plastic surgery."

We wished to determine the relative contribution of this method of repair to postoperative infection rates. Midfacial trauma cases occurring between the years 1984 and 1991 at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, were reviewed. Patients were grouped according to method of repair (intermaxillary fixation, open reduction with wire fixation, or open reduction with rigid internal fixation plates). Postoperative infection data (wound infections, sinusitis, etc) were obtained by chart review and telephone interview. Minimum follow-up for inclusion in the study was 3 months, with an average follow-up for all groups of 28.8 months. We found no significant difference in the rate, or the type, of postoperative infections in all three groups.

AlloDerm has been touted as a promoter of neovascularization and collagen deposition. Currently, the rate of AlloDerm infection in contaminated cases is unknown. Our objective was to determine if the organisms cultured during source control would infect AlloDerm.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The medical records of patients who required complex abdominal closure with AlloDerm in a tertiary-care hospital were reviewed from January to December, 2005. For each patient demographic, the reason for urgent surgery, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, serum albumin concentration, culture results of purulent fluid obtained during surgery, and culture results of biopsies of infected-appearing AlloDerm (change of color, delayed granulation, odor) were collected.

The mean preoperative albumin concentration was 2.27 +/- 0.26 g/dL. Most (76%) of the patients had a wound vacuum-assisted closure system placed over the AlloDerm. Four patients (24%) were noted to have an infection of the AlloDerm graft at 24 +/- 10 days postoperatively. The cultures obtained at operation and from infected AlloDerm show similar organisms (Pseudomonas in two, Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in one each).

Studies have found that telemedicine can provide efficient triaging, reduction in emergency room visits, and conservation of health care resources and personnel. Although virtual patient care has been implicated in providing similar outcomes to traditional face-to-face care in patients affected with coronavirus disease 2019, there are a lack of studies on the effectiveness of virtual care visits (VCVs) for patients with craniosynostosis or deformational plagiocephaly. This study aims to develop an understanding of whether physicians can accurately diagnose pediatric patients with craniosynostosis or deformational plagiocephaly via VCVs, and whether they can determine if affected patients will benefit from helmet correction or if surgical treatment is required.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective chart analysis over a 4-month period (March 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020) was performed analyzing all pediatric patients (<18 years old) who underwent virtual care calls for diagnosis and treatment of abnormal head shape. Patients were referred to UT Physicians Pediatric Surgery clinic for evaluation by a member of the Texas Cleft-Craniofacial Team (2 surgeons or 1 physician's assistant). Variables such as patient demographics, diagnosis, and need for confirmation were pulled and recorded from Allscripts Electronic Medical Records software.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-five patients were identified who fit our search criteria. Out of these patients, eleven (31.43%) cases were diagnosed with craniosynostosis, twenty-two (62.86%) cases were diagnosed with deformational plagiocephaly, and 2 (5.71%) cases were diagnosed as being normocephalic. Median age at virtual care evaluation was 14.10 months (Interquartile Range [IQR] 5.729, 27.542) for patients diagnosed with craniosynostosis and 6.51 months (IQR 4.669, 7.068) for patients diagnosed with deformational plagiocephaly. All eleven (100%) patients diagnosed with craniosynostosis were referred for a confirmatory computed tomography scan before undergoing surgical intervention and saw an alleviation in head shape postoperatively. Eighteen (81.82%) of patients diagnosed with deformational plagiocephaly were recommended to undergo conservative treatment and the remaining 4 (18.18%) were recommended for helmet therapy. Two cases were unable to be diagnosed virtually. These patients needed a follow-up visit in person to establish a diagnosis and plan of treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Virtual care visits are increasing in frequency and this includes consultations for abnormal head shapes. Our experience demonstrates that the majority of patients can be evaluated safely in this modality, with only 5.71% requiring additional imaging or in-person visits to confirm the diagnosis. Our study underscores the feasibility of virtually diagnosing and recommending a plan for treatment in pediatric patients with abnormal head shapes. This information can be implemented to further our knowledge on the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment options for patients with craniosynostosis and deformational plagiocephaly.

            "abstract": "Septorhinoplasty is associated with postoperative infection in less than 2% of cases, even without the use of prophylactic antibiotics. However, there is a concern that increasingly prevalent, highly virulent pathogens such as MRSA may predispose to postoperative infections. Over the past several decades, MRSA has emerged as the most important cause of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial infection. MRSA-associated infections related to nasal surgery are underreported in the literature. We present a case of MRSA-associated infection following a routine septorhinoplasty in a health care worker. We discuss the incidence of this complication and contributing risk factors. The classification of MRSA-associated infections into genotypically distinct hospital-acquired and community-acquired subtypes is reviewed, and the associated differences in epidemiology, clinical presentation, and antibiotic susceptibility are discussed. A comprehensive strategy incorporating diagnostic workup, preventative management based upon preoperative risk stratification, and treatment of MRSA-associated soft tissue infections is presented."

Despite the availability of numerous apps and mobile platforms focusing on specific areas in healthcare the widespread integration into clinical practice can be a complex process. Here we present guidelines and methodology that we have learned in the implementation process of new technology and an overview of some of the current barriers and enablers specific to implementation of post-surgical site surveillance technology. Methods: Analysis of the experience of successful information technology (IT) implementation in different healthcare systems reveals that, despite differences among patient groups, care providers, and hospitals, there are common barriers and enablers to implementation of health IT. Results: The process of implementation in organizations and among individuals can be most successful by identifying barriers and enablers within three key stakeholder groups: (1) patients; (2) care providers/clinicians; and (3) manager/administration within healthcare systems. This can be achieved by specific engagement and co-design processes establishing clear benefits, sufficient incentives, and adequate support for clinicians as well as payer-provider relationships, marketplace competition and privacy legislation. Conclusions: The successful implementation of such programs requires appropriate strategic planning to address the needs of three specific components: patients, care provider, and policymakers/healthcare management understanding and acceptance."

In response, numerous initiatives have focused on fostering technological innovations, new management approaches and health policies. Research suggests that the most successful innovations are those involving stakeholders at all levels. However, there is little evidence exploring the opinions of local health providers that could contribute with further innovation development and research. The aims of this study were to explore the perspectives of medical doctors (MDs) working in rural areas of Peru, regarding the barriers impacting the diagnostic process, and ideas for diagnostic innovations that could assist them.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data gathered through three focus group discussions (FGG) and 18 individual semi-structured interviews (SSI) with MDs who had completed their medical service in rural areas of Peru in the last two years were analyzed using thematic analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Three types of barriers emerged.

Ultrasound was needed for the diagnosis of obstetric and intra-abdominal conditions. There were also health system-related barriers such as limited funding for diagnostic services, shortage of specialists, limited laboratory services and access to telecommunications, and lack of institutional support.

An electronic blood pressure manometer, a videophone, an antihypertensive drug (amlodipine), and a customer satisfaction questionnaire were given to every group A patient. With a video-communication program linked to the Web, we monitored every 4 hours (from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.) for 2 days the surgical wound, blood pressure, and heart frequency of the patients. Other patients were included in group B. No differences regarding demographic characteristics, risk factors, carotid lesions, operative time, postoperative complications, or blood loss were noted between group A and group B. Twenty-one patients in group A were actually discharged 1 day after surgery. No cervical hematoma developed. Three hypertensive crises were treated successfully in group A. From the questionnaire a feeling of insecurity at discharge emerged, but it rapidly resolved. The overall cost of video connections was 25.39 +/- 0.25 Euros per patient.

Instead of receiving their follow up care at the acute care tertiary hospital, patients were given the option to receive their care at primary care facilities instead, supported by teleconsultation wound services provided by wound care nurses from the hospital. The following outcome measures were collected: number of care sessions required (until wound healed), readmissions or referrals back to hospital, cost (patient's and healthcare provider's perspective), patients' and nurses' satisfaction. In total, 18 patients were recruited and completed the study (teleconsult group = 5; tertiary care clinic group = 13). The mean age (SD) of patients were 63.2 (SD 11.5) years old in the teleconsult group and 47.9 years old (SD 11.5) in the tertiary care clinic group. There were 7 female (54%), and 6 male (46%) in the tertiary care clinic group whereas teleconsult group consisted of male only (n = 5).

For patients with carbuncle wounds, the average number of care sessions required were 21 and 33 for the tertiary care clinic and teleconsult respectively. None of the patients in the teleconsult group were referred back to the tertiary care hospital. All 16 nurses (n = 6 from acute care hospital, n = 10 from polyclinics) who participated in the feedback survey cited convenience, ease of tracking wound sizes, and closer collaboration between the acute care and primary care nurses as advantages of the service.

There was a difference in surgery costs (median 6.664 €; 7.870 USD with SSI vs. median 5.040 €; 5.952 USD without SSI; p = 0.001) and costs on the surgical ward (median 8.404 €; 9.924 USD with SSI vs. median 4.690 €; 5.538 USD without SSI; p < 0.001). Patients with SSI were less satisfied with the cosmetic result (4.3% vs. 16.2%; p < 0.001). Overall costs for patients who were irrigated with saline were median 12.056 €; 14.237 USD vs. median 12.793 €; 15.107 USD in the polyhexanide group (p = 0.52).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      SSI after elective laparotomy increased hospital costs substantially.

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nA considerable proportion of surgical site infections (SSI) could be prevented by surveillance. The study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of 3 methods of SSI surveillance: Inpatient, phone, and out-patient clinic (OPC); to ensure that the risk of SSI is independent from loss-to-follow-up in phone and OPC surveillances, and to determine the reliability of phone surveillance.\n## METHODS\nA cohort of 351 surgical patients were followed by 3 different surveillance methods: inpatient, follow-up in OPC and over the phone. Costs of nurse time and phone calls were expressed in 2019 USD. Effectiveness of surveillance was assessed using number of detected SSIs.\n## RESULTS\nPhone surveillance was more cost-effective than OPC surveillance. Compared to inpatient surveillance, the OPC method costs USD 15.6 per extra detected SSI, whereas the phone method costs only USD 4.6 In phone and OPC surveillances, the risk of SSI was independent of loss-to-follow-up. However, the higher rate of SSI among OPC attendees raises the suspicion that the incidence of SSI estimated by OPC surveillance could be biased upward. Phone surveillance was reliable with high sensitivity and specificity.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPhone surveillance was a reliable cost-effective method. Inpatient surveillance was less effective, but it still can be used to detect severe SSI at low cost. While out-patient-clinic surveillance had the highest cost, the incidence estimated by it might be biased upward.\n"

Methods: Patients were adult women who underwent c-section at a Rwandan rural district hospital between March and October 2017. A CHW administered a nine-item clinical questionnaire 10 ± 3 days post-operatively. Independently, a general practitioner (GP) administered the same questionnaire and assessed SSI presence by physical examination. The GP's SSI diagnosis was used as the gold standard. Using a simplified Classification and Regression Tree analysis, we identified a subset of screening questions with maximum sensitivity for the GP and CHW and evaluated the subset's sensitivity and specificity in a validation dataset. Then, we compared the subset's results when implemented in the community by CHWs with health center-reported SSI. Results: Of the 596 women enrolled, 525 (88.1%) completed the clinical questionnaire. The combination of questions concerning fever, pain, and discolored drainage maximized sensitivity for both the GPs (sensitivity = 96.8%; specificity = 85.6%) and CHWs (sensitivity = 87.1%; specificity = 73.8%). In the validation dataset, this subset had sensitivity of 95.2% and specificity of 83.3% for the GP-administered questions and sensitivity of 76.2% and specificity of 81.4% for the CHW-administered questions. In the community screening, the overall percent agreement between CHW and health center diagnoses was 81.1% (95% confidence interval: 77.2%-84.6%). Conclusions: We identified a subset of questions that had good predictive features for SSI, but its sensitivity was lower when administered by CHWs in a clinical setting, and it performed poorly in the community.

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most common and potentially serious complications after surgery. Staphylococcus aureus is a virulent pathogen frequently identified as a cause of SSI. As vaccines and other infection control measures are developed to reduce SSI risk, cost-utility analyses (CUA) of these interventions are needed to inform resource allocation decisions. A recent systematic review found that available SSI utilities are of \"questionable quality.\" Therefore, the purpose of this study was to estimate the disutility (i.e., utility decrease) associated with SSIs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In time trade-off interviews, general population participants in the UK (London, Edinburgh) valued health states drafted based on literature and clinician interviews. Health states described either joint or spine surgery, with or without an SSI. The utility difference between otherwise identical health states with and without the SSI represented the disutility associated with the SSI.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 201 participants completed interviews (50.2% female; mean age = 46.2 years). Mean (SD) utilities of health states describing joint and spine surgery without infections were 0.79 (0.23) and 0.78 (0.23). Disutilities of SSIs ranged from - 0.03 to - 0.32, depending on severity of the infection and subsequent medical interventions. All differences between corresponding health with and without SSIs were statistically significant (all p < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The preference-based SSI disutilities derived in this study may be used to represent mild and serious SSIs in CUAs assessing and comparing the value of vaccinations that may reduce the risk of SSIs."

            "abstract": "Sequential analysis of uncommon adverse outcomes (AEs) such as surgical site infections (SSIs) is desirable. Short postoperative lengths of stay (LOS) result in many SSIs occurring after discharge and they are often superficial. Deep and organ space (complex) SSIs occur less frequently but are detected more reliably and are suitable for monitoring wound care. Those occurring post-discharge usually require readmissison and can be counted accurately. Sequential analysis of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is also needed. The key to prevention is to implement systems based on evidence, e.g. using 'bundles' and checklists. Regular mortality and morbidity audit meetings are required and these may need to be followed by independent audits. Sequential statistical analysis is desirable for data presentation, to detect changes, and to discourage tampering with processes when occasional AEs occur in a reliable system. Tabulations and cumulative observed minus expected (O-E) charts and funnel plots are valuable, supplemented in the presence of apparent 'runs' of AEs by cumulative sum analysis. Used prospectively, they may enable staff to visualise and detect patterns or shifts in rates and counts that might not otherwise be apparent."

However, little is known about patient preferences and design considerations for apps intended to help in a post-acute setting. Our team is developing an mHealth platform to engage patients in wound tracking to identify and manage surgical site infections (SSI) after hospital discharge. Post-discharge SSIs are a major source of morbidity and expense, and occur at a critical care transition when patients are physically and emotionally stressed. Through interviews with surgical patients who experienced SSI, we derived design considerations for such a post-acute care app. Key design qualities include: meeting basic accessibility, usability and security needs; encouraging patient-centeredness; facilitating better, more predictable communication; and supporting personalized management by providers. We illustrate our application of these guiding design considerations and propose a new framework for mHealth design based on illness duration and intensity."

The surgical technique used to access the femoral artery may be a factor in the occurrence of postoperative complications; this will be the focus of our review. We will compare the transverse surgical technique-a cut made parallel to the groin crease-versus the vertical groin incision surgical technique-classic technique: a surgical cut made across the groin crease-to access the femoral artery, in an attempt to determine which technique has the lower rate of complications, is safer and is more effective.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of transverse groin incision compared with vertical groin incision for accessing the femoral artery in endovascular surgical procedures and open surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and AMED databases, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov to 17 February 2020.

These two studies had a combined total of 237 participants (283 groins). Infection of the surgical wound was the only outcome that was similar in both studies, and that could therefore be submitted to a combined analysis. Meta-analysis of the two studies showed low-certainty evidence that transverse groin incision resulted in a lower risk of surgical wound infection in the 10- to 28-day period following surgery (risk ratio [RR] 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08 to 0.76; 2 studies; 283 groin incisions). There was low heterogeneity between the studies. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for surgical wound infection by one level due to serious limitations in the design (there was a high risk of bias in critical domains). The confidence interval for surgical wound infection is relatively wide, further indicating that the certainty of the effect estimate is low. This is likely due to the small number of studies and participants. We observed no evidence of a difference between the two surgical techniques for the other evaluated primary outcome 'lymphatic complications': lymphocele (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.02; 1 study; 116 groins); and lymphorrhea (RR 2.77, 95% CI 0.92 to 8.34; 1 study; 116 groins). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for lymphatic complications by one level due to serious limitations in the design (there was a high risk of bias in critical domains); and by two further levels because of imprecision (small number of participants and only one study included). High-quality studies are needed to enable a comparison of the two surgical techniques with respect to other outcomes, such as infection of the vascular graft (endoprosthesis/prosthesis), prolonged hospitalization, reoperative surgery, death, neurological deficit (e.g. paresthesia), amputation, graft patency, and postoperative pain.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this systematic review, we found low-certainty evidence that performing transverse groin incision to access the femoral artery resulted in fewer surgical wound infections compared with performing vertical groin incision. We observed no evidence of a difference between the two surgical techniques for the other evaluated outcomes (lymphocele and lymphorrhea). Other outcomes were not evaluated in these studies. Limitations of this systematic review are, however, the small sample size, short clinical follow-up period and high risk of bias in critical domains. For this reason, the applicability of the results is limited."

More in-depth research is needed for validation of this technique within plastic surgery. While maintaining quality of care and a vital role in social distancing, there is a strong need for standardisation of Telemedicine processes, platforms, encryption and data storage.\n    \n\n\n          Level of evidence v:\n        \n      \n      This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

            "abstract": "Civil processes and criminal procedures against physicians and/or medical assistants due to retained foreign bodies following surgery are not uncommon within the framework of the booming liability disputes in hospitals. As the protection and safety of the patient is the highest priority, the physician must take all feasible and reasonable precautions against such a possibility during both in- and outpatient operations.These include clear, written instructions for the assisting medical personnel in relation to count control, its documentation, final revision and specification in the surgical report. The delegation of swab and instrument counts to reliable OP nurses and other personnel is juristically possible and leads to their own responsibility, based on principle of basic trust, i.e. the physician can rely on the correct count of abdominal sponges, swabs etc. If an error does occur, the organizational liability does not fall on those responsible for the operation."

The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of the WHO surgical checklist would have an impact on the number and causes of neurosurgical complications leading to a reoperation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The authors retrospectively gathered information on all neurosurgical reoperations using hospital discharge data as well as the operations and procedures registry, and tracked all primary neurosurgical operations (n = 175) preceding a complication-related reoperation from 2007 to 2011. There were a total of 5418 neurosurgical operations during the study period. For further analysis of electronic patient records, the primary operations were divided into 2 groups based on the time of the WHO surgical checklist implementation in the authors' unit: 103 operations before and 72 after the introduction of the checklist. Observed adverse events and reoperations were categorized as preventable or unpreventable, and the actual use of the checklist during each operation was recorded.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The overall rate of preventable complication-related neurosurgical reoperations decreased from 3.3% (95% CI 2.7%-4.0%) to 2.0% (95% CI 1.5%-2.6%) after the checklist implementation. The reoperations were mainly due to wound infections, 46% before and 39% after the checklist. All infection-related reoperations proportioned to all neurosurgical operations (2.5% before vs 1.6% after checklist implementation) showed a significant reduction (p = 0.02) after the implementation of the checklist. In particular, there was a significant decrease (p = 0.006) in the rate of preventable infections associated with reoperations, i.e., 2.2% before versus 1.2% after checklist implementation. The overall adherence to checklist use (the \"time out\" phase) in neurosurgical operations was 78%, and adherence was 70% in primary operations preceding a complication-related reoperation regarded as preventable.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The implementation of the WHO surgical checklist in neurosurgery was associated with a decrease in complication-related reoperations, especially those due to preventable infection complications, the majority of which were wound infections.

            "abstract": "Background: Surgical site infections (SSIs) represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Ethiopia. Lack of post-discharge follow-up, including identification of SSIs, is a barrier to continued patient care, often because of financial and travel constraints. As part of a surgical quality improvement initiative, we aimed to assess patient outcomes at 30 days post-operative with a telephone call. Patients and Methods: We conducted mobile telephone follow-up as part of Lifebox's ongoing Clean Cut program, which aims to improve compliance with intra-operative infection prevention standards. One urban tertiary referral hospital and one rural district general hospital in Ethiopia were included in this phase of the study; hospital nursing staff called patients at 30 days post-operative inquiring about signs of SSIs, health-care-seeking behavior, and treatments provided if patients had any healthcare encounters since discharge. Results: A total of 701 patients were included; overall 77% of patients were reached by telephone call after discharge. The rural study site reached 362 patients (87%) by telephone; the urban site reached 176 patients (62%) (p < 0.001). Of the 39 SSIs identified, 19 (49%) were captured as outpatient during the telephone follow-up (p < 0.001); 22 (34%) of all complications were captured following discharge (p < 0.001). Telephone follow-up improved from 65%-78% in the first half of project implementation to 77%-89% in the second half of project implementation. Conclusion: Telephone follow-up after surgery in Ethiopia is feasible and valuable, and identified nearly half of all SSIs and one-third of total complications in our cohort. Follow-up improved over the course of the program, likely indicating a learning curve that, once overcome, is a more accurate marker of its practicability. Given the increasing use of mobile telephones in Ethiopia and ease of implementation, this model could be practical in other low-resource surgical settings."

The purpose of this study was to present our experience in treating infected TMJ total joint prostheses over a 12-year period, as well as the protocol we have developed to manage acute infections and the protocol we follow for chronic infections of TMJ total joint prostheses.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      This retrospective study evaluated the records of 316 consecutive patients (290 female and 26 male patients) who had TMJ reconstruction from 1997 to 2009 by 1 surgeon, using patient-fitted TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses (TMJ Concepts, Ventura, CA), with a total of 579 prostheses placed, to determine the occurrence and management methods of postoperative infections. Postoperative infections involving the TMJ prostheses developed in 8 of 316 patients (2.5%) and 9 of 579 prostheses (1.6%): 7 patients unilaterally and 1 patient bilaterally. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (n = 5) had acute infections in 6 joints and group 2 (n = 3) had chronic infections in 3 joints. Patient 5 began in group 1 but was transferred to group 2. One patient with Munchausen syndrome and self-induced infections was eliminated from the study.

We found that 4 of 5 patients (80%) and 5 of 6 joints (83%) were successfully treated with retention of the prostheses. Patient 5 varied from the protocol and maintained a chronic infection of her right TMJ prosthesis that transferred her to group 2.

Despite the need for rational and prudent antimicrobial use, few peer-reviewed and published veterinary studies have investigated the pathogenic growth including susceptibility patterns of the isolated pathogens in canine SSIs. The first objective of the present study was to estimate the distribution of bacterial pathogens in dogs with SSI and to investigate whether this was influenced by type of surgical procedure (clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated or dirty), duration of hospitalization, wound classification and depth of the infection, or antimicrobial treatment. The second objective was to assess susceptibility patterns to clinically relevant antimicrobials. During three years, four animal referral hospitals and three small animal clinics submitted bacterial swabs from canine SSIs for culture and susceptibility, together with a questionnaire completed by the attending clinician.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Approximately two thirds of the in total 194 isolates were staphylococci.

No associations between distribution of the isolated pathogens and classification of the surgical procedure, duration of hospitalization or depth of the SSI were shown, with the exception of Escherichia coli isolates being significantly more often found in deep wound infections than in superficial skin infections. Overall the possibilities of finding first generations antimicrobials to treat the SSIs included in the study were favorable, as the isolated pathogens were mostly without acquired antimicrobial resistance and multidrug resistance was uncommon. There were only three cases of methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius-infections (one percent of all isolates), one case of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli-infection, and no methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      None of the investigated factors were shown to influence the distribution of bacterial pathogens. The majority of SSIs were caused by staphylococci, and S. pseudintermedius was the most prevalent pathogen.

Some recent articles advocating T4 sympathectomy have obtained satisfactory results. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of 3 different levels of sympathectomy. Between July 2003 and July 2006, we treated 60 patients (20 men and 40 women, mean age 26 years) who suffer from palmar hyperhidrosis by endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS). Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the level of sympathectomy: ETS2, ETS3, and ETS4 (20 patients in each group). Data were collected by review of medical charts, outpatient clinic notes, and telephone interviews. Patients were asked whether they considered their symptoms to be \"cured\" or \"unchanged.\" The degree of hand dryness was assessed subjectively. Postoperative complications (wound infection, chest pain, and Horner's syndrome) were assessed. Any occurrence of gustatory sweating, rhinitis, presence and region of reflex compensatory sweating, and recurrence was noted. Patient satisfaction was assessed. Treatment success at follow-up was 90% for the ETS2, 95% for ETS3 patients, and 100% for the ETS4 patients. In the ETS2 and ETS3 groups, a higher rate of overdryness of limbs was observed (35% and 20%, respectively).

About 40% of ETS2 groups and 25% of ETS3 group patients were unsatisfied with their operation. All patients of the ETS4 group were satisfied with the outcome. In conclusion, ETS4 sympathectomy is an effective method for treating PH and it decreases the rate of compensatory hydrosis (CH)."

We sought to identify risk factors for postoperative infection and the impact on outcomes after congenital heart surgery, using data from the International Quality Improvement Collaborative for Congenital Heart Surgery in Developing World Countries.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      Pediatric cardiac surgical cases performed between 2010 and 2012 at 27 participating sites in 16 developing countries were included. Key variables were audited during site visits. Demographics, preoperative, procedural, surgical complexity, and outcome data were analyzed. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify risk factors for infection, including bacterial sepsis and surgical site infection, and other clinical outcomes. Standardized infection ratios were computed to track progress over time. Of 14 545 cases, 793 (5.5%) had bacterial sepsis and 306 (2.1%) had surgical site infection. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher among cases with infection than among those without infection (16.7% versus 5.3%; P<0.001), as were postoperative ventilation duration (80 versus 14 hours; P<0.001) and intensive care unit stay (216 versus 68 hours; P<0.001). Younger age at surgery, higher surgical complexity, lower oxygen saturation, and major medical illness were independent risk factors for infection. The overall standardized infection ratio was 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.73) in 2011 and 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.64) in 2012, compared with that in 2010.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Postoperative infections contribute to mortality and morbidity after congenital heart surgery. Younger, more complex patients are at particular risk. Quality improvement targeted at infection risk may reduce morbidity and mortality in the developing world."

The aim of the ISChIA study (\"Infezioni del Sito Chirurgico in Interventi di Artroprotesi\" which means \"Surgical site infections in arthroplasty surgery\") was to evaluate, as a contribution to this debate, the association between heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, microbial air contamination and surgical site infection in hip and knee arthroplasty.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study was performed from March 2010 to February 2012 in 14 hospitals, for a total of 28 operating theatres: 16 were equipped with vertical unidirectional airflow ventilation (U-OTs), 6 with mixed airflow ventilation (M-OTs), 6 with turbulent airflow ventilation (T-OTs). Microbial air contamination in the operating theatre was evaluated by means of passive (Index of Microbial Air contamination, IMA) and active (Colony Forming Units per cubic metre, cfu/m3) sampling.

No significant difference was observed between SSI cumulative incidence in surgical procedures performed in U-OTs compared with those performed in T-OTs. A lower risk of SSI, even though not statistically significant, was shown in surgical procedures performed in U-OTs with a microbial air contamination within the recommended values (≤2 IMA and ≤10 cfu/m3) compared with those performed in U-OTs where these limits were exceeded, and compared with those performed in T-OTs with microbial air contamination within the recommended values for this type of OTs (≤25 IMA, ≤180 cfu/m3.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      ISChIA study did not show a protective effect of unidirectional airflow compared with turbulent airflow in arthroplasty surgery.

It is uncertain whether antibiotics reduce the incidence of surgical site infections as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.85; 5 studies, 226 participants; I2 = 25%). The certainty of the evidence was very low for all other reported outcomes (death, graft loss, and other infections). It is uncertain whether extended duration antibiotics reduces the incidence of surgical site infections in either solid organ transplant recipients (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.48; 2 studies, 302 participants; I2 = 0%) or kidney-only transplant recipients (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.48; 1 study, 205 participants) as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. The certainty of the evidence was very low for all other reported outcomes (death, graft loss, and other infections). None of the eight included studies evaluated antimicrobial agent adverse reactions, graft health, cardiovascular disease, cancer, life participation, biochemical and haematological parameters, intervention cost, hospitalisation length, or overall hospitalisation costs.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Due to methodological limitations, risk of bias and significant heterogeneity, the current evidence for the use of prophylactic perioperative antibiotics in transplantation is of very low quality. Further high quality, adequately powered RCTs would help better inform clinical practice."

The practice of surgeons taking phone calls while remaining sterile in the operating field is often accomplished by interposing a sterile disposable towel between the phone and their glove. After completing the call, surgeons resume operating. The purpose of our study was to test the conceptual idea of whether bacteria transmit from an inanimate object, such as a telephone, to the gloves of a surgeon through a sterile disposable towel.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      Glo Germ (Glo Germ Co), an ultraviolet light-enhanced particle powder sized to mimic bacteria, was placed on an inanimate surface and held with a sterile disposable operating room towel covering a sterile surgical glove.

It may cause exposure of the underlying prosthesis causing graft infection, which may require the removal of the vascular graft, increasing amputation and mortality risks. Graft contamination usually occurs during operative procedure or by direct spread from an infected wound. It is therefore advisable to a strong effort in reducing SSI. Topic antibiotics have not been fully studied in vascular surgery, but collagen implant with gentamicin sulphate has shown to reduce SSI in cardiac surgery, orthopaedics, and general surgery procedures.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Sixty (60) non-diabetic and non-obese patients with lower limb ischaemia with indication for femoropopliteal PTFE prosthetic bypass were allocated into 2 groups of 30 patients.

Advantages include increasing accessibility, potential to reduce costs and, during the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced risk of infection transmission. Here, we systematically collate and synthesise the evidence base on outcomes from remote consultation in adult and paediatric ENT services.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed a review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. We searched Medline and Embase for relevant articles. Outcomes include specific patient pathway efficiency measures (including number of healthcare visits, lead time, touch time and handoff), patient/clinician satisfaction, cost analysis and safety implications.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      From 6325 articles screened, 53 met inclusion criteria. Publications included studies on remote consultation for initial, preoperative and follow-up assessment (including postoperative). In most instances, remote consultation reduced costs and time from referral to assessment and was associated with high patient satisfaction. However, a face-to-face follow-up appointment was required in 13%-72% of initial consultations, suggesting that remote consultation is only appropriate in selected cases.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Remote consultation is appropriate and preferable for ENT consultation in specific conditions and circumstances. Future research should look to better define those conditions and circumstances, and report using recognised quality standards and outcome measures."

In the validation survey, we found patient telephone surveillance to have a sensitivity of 66% (95% CI 40-93%) and a specificity of 90% (95% CI 86-94%). The meta-analysis included five additional studies. The overall sensitivity was 83.3% (95% CI 79-88%), and the overall specificity was 97.4% (95% CI 97-98%). Simulation of the meta-analysis results divulged that when the true infection rate is 1%, reported rates would be 4%; a true rate of 50%, the reported rates would be 43%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Patient self-assessment strategies in order to fulfill 30-day SSI surveillance misestimate SSI rates and lead to an erroneous overall appreciation of inter-institutional variation. Self-assessment strategies overestimate SSIs rate of institutions with high-quality performance and underestimate rates of poor performance. We propose such strategies be abandoned. Alternative strategies of patient follow-up strategies should be evaluated in order to provide valid and reliable information regarding institutional performance in preventing patient harm."

            "abstract": "A new self-retaining scalp retractor is described, which elevates the scalp away from the skull to allow better access and vision in preparing the bony recess for a cochlear implant and protect the pericranium from surgical trauma. It is designed for use with the present generation of small vertical scalp incisions in cochlear implant surgery. In these incisions, the part of the skull drilled to create the implant bed is not directly under the wound; instead, it extends under a flap of scalp and pericranium for 5 cm or more. The retractor is simple to use, and the authors believe that it represents a new type of retractor, which may have other uses in the fields of orthopedic; ear, nose, and throat, cosmetic, and plastic surgery. Photographs demonstrate the instrument in use. A cochlear implant company has agreed to manufacture the instrument."

Clinically significant grade B or C POPFs occurred in 17 (44.7%) of 38 TDPs compared with 41 (15.8%) of 260 EDPs (p < 0.0001). On multivariable analysis, traumatic injury was found to be independently predictive of developing a grade B or C POPF (odds ratio, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.10-8.89). Age, sex, and wound infection were highly correlated with traumatic etiology and therefore were not retained in the multivariable model. When analyzing risk factors for each group (trauma vs. elective) separately, we found that TDP patients who developed POPFs had less sutured closure of their duct, higher infectious complications, and longer hospital stays, while EDP patients that suffered POPFs were more likely to be male, younger in age, and at a greater risk for infectious complications. Lastly, in a subgroup analysis involving only patients with drains left postoperatively, trauma was an independent predictor of any grade of fistula (A, B, or C) compared with elective DP (odds ratio, 8.6; 95% confidence interval, 3.09-24.15), suggesting that traumatic injury is risk factor for pancreatic stump closure disruption following DP.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      To our knowledge, this study represents the largest cohort of patients comparing pancreatic leak rates in traumatic versus elective DP, and demonstrates that traumatic injury is an independent risk factor for developing an ISGPF grade B or C pancreatic fistula following DP.\n    \n\n\n          Level of evidence:\n        \n      \n      Prognostic study, Therapeutic, level III."

Our prediction model demonstrated that body mass index ≥30 kg/m(2), smoking, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class 3, open surgical approach, prolonged operative times, and inpatient admission following VIHR were significant predictors of postoperative SSIs. In addition, risk factors associated with prolonged LOS included older age, African American ethnicity, history of alcohol abuse, ASA classes 3 and 4, poor functional status, operation within the last 30 days of the index operation, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and bleeding disorder, as well as open surgical approach, non-involvement of residents, prolonged operative times, recurrent hernia, emergency operation, and low preoperative serum albumin level.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Obesity and smoking are modifiable risk factors for SSIs after VIHR, whereas a low serum albumin level is a modifiable risk factor for prolonged LOS.

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL, published up to Nov 23, 2021, that directly compared two or more antiseptic agents (ie, chlorhexidine, iodine, or olanexidine) or concentrations in aqueous and alcohol-based solutions. We excluded paediatric, animal, and non-randomised studies, and studies not providing standard preoperative intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis. Studies with no SSIs in both groups were excluded from the quantitative analysis. Two reviewers screened and reviewed eligible full texts and extracted data.

Herein, we aimed to unravel the biological and inflammatory potential of bioengineered spider silk materials to prevent SSI using an infection animal model. Silk-like fibers made of silk fibroin and spider silk proteins with antimicrobial peptides (6mer-HNP1) held improved stiffness (2.9 GPa) and had a slow biodegradation profile while inhibiting bacterial adherence in vitro by 5-log and 6-log reduction on Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), respectively. In vivo studies showed that fibers with 6mer-HNP1 elicited a short-term low to mild local inflammatory response, similar to implanted commercial sutures. In the presence of a bacterial infection, the mediators related to infection and inflammation were downregulated suggesting that the fibers maintained a low but active response to bacterial infection. Thus, the presence of 6mer-HNP1 helped the host maintain an active response to bacterial infection, impairing the development of an acute infection. Our findings further support the use of bioengineered spider silk proteins to develop drug-free antimicrobial sutures capable to impair SSI."

Of these, three core measures contain recommendations regarding selection of prophylactic antibiotic, timing of administration, and duration of therapy. For most patients undergoing clean-contaminated surgeries (e.g., cardiothoracic, gastrointestinal, orthopedic, vascular, gynecologic), a cephalosporin is the recommended prophylactic antibiotic. Hospital compliance with infection prevention measures is publicly reported.

However, no previous study has explored this association among video-assisted thoracic surgeries (VATS). Hence, we aimed to investigate the association between the frequency of surgeries and SSI in video-assisted thoracic surgeries.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We analyzed the data of 26,878 thoracic surgeries, including 21,154 VATS, which were collected during a national surveillance in Japan between 2014 and 2018. The frequency of surgeries per hospital department was categorized into low (< 50/year), moderate (50-100/ year), and high (> 100/year). Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test was used for discrete explanatory variables, whereas Wilcoxon's rank-sum test or Kruskal-Wallis test was used for continuous explanatory variables. Univariate analysis of the department groups was conducted to explore confounding factors associated with both SSIs and the department groups. We used a multiple logistic regression model focusing on VATS and stratified by the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System (NNIS) risk index.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The rates of SSIs in the hospital groups with low, moderate, and high frequency of surgeries were 1.39, 1.05, and 1.28%, respectively. In the NNIS risk index 1 stratum, the incidence of SSIs was significantly lower in the moderate-frequency of surgeries group than that in the other groups (odds ratio [OR]: vs. low-frequency of surgeries: 2.48 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-5.13], P = 0.0143; vs. high-frequency of surgeries: 2.43 [95% CI: 1.44-4.11], P = 0.0009).

While in 2004, MRSA was found in 24.4 % of all detected Staphylococcus aureus strains in swab specimens amounting to a considerable increase compared to 2002 (17.6 %), in 1995, MRSA was not isolated at all in this material. In the fungi group, there was a decrease of the Candida albicans portion vs. the non-C. albicans strains, which was associated with an increasing resistance against fluconazol.

            "abstract": "Background: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are costly and associated with poorer patient outcomes. Intra-operative surgical site irrigation and intra-cavity lavage may reduce the risk of SSIs through removal of dead or damaged tissue, metabolic waste, and site exudate. Irrigation with antibiotic or antiseptic solutions may further reduce the risk of SSI because of bacteriocidal properties. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted comparing irrigation solutions, but important comparisons (e.g., antibiotic vs. antiseptic irrigation) are absent. We use systematic review-based network meta-analysis (NMA) of RCTs to compare irrigation solutions for prevention of SSI. Methods: We used Cochrane methodology and included all RCTs of participants undergoing a surgical procedure with primary site closure, in which method of irrigation was the only systematic difference between groups. We used a random effects Bayesian NMA to create a connected network of comparisons. Results are presented as odds ratios (OR) of SSI, where OR <1 indicates a beneficial effect. Results: We identified 42 eligible RCTs with 11,726 participants. Most were at unclear or high risk of bias. The RCTs included groups given no irrigation or non-antibacterial, antiseptic, or antibiotic irrigation. There was substantial heterogeneity, and a random effects model was selected. Relative to non-antibacterial irrigation, mean OR of SSI was 0.439 (95% credible interval: 0.282, 0.667) for antibiotic irrigation and 0.573 (0.321, 0.953) for antiseptic agents. No irrigation was similar to non-antibacterial irrigation (OR 0.959 [0.555, 1.660]). Antibiotic and antiseptic irrigation were ranked as most effective for preventing SSIs; this conclusion was robust to potential bias. Conclusions: Our NMA found that antibiotic and antiseptic irrigation had the lowest odds of SSI. There was high heterogeneity, however, and studies were at high risk of bias. A large RCT directly comparing antibiotic irrigation with both antiseptic and non-antibacterial irrigation is needed to define the standard of care for SSI prevention by site irrigation."

Microbial sealant is a liquid that can be applied to the skin immediately before surgery and is thought to help reduce the incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) by sealing in the skin flora, thus preventing contamination and infection of the surgical site.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effects of the preoperative application of microbial sealants (compared with no microbial sealant) on rates of SSI in people undergoing clean surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      For this first update we searched the following electronic databases in July 2013: the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE - In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion if they involved people undergoing clean surgery (i.e. surgery that does not involve the breathing system, gut, genital or urinary tract or any part of the body with an existing infection) in an operating theatre and compared the use of preoperative microbial sealants with no microbial sealant.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      All review authors independently extracted data on the characteristics, risk of bias and outcomes of the eligible trials.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Three trials (524 participants undergoing clean surgery) met the inclusion criteria. The trials all compared cyanoacrylate microbial sealant with no sealant, and, when pooled, we found there were fewer SSIs with the use of microbial sealant (10/261 participants) than with the control comparison (29/274 participants). The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.72) but given the number of participants and quality of the studies, they should be treated with caution. There were some adverse events in one study, but these were not judged to be a result of the use of microbial sealant.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this first update there is still insufficient evidence available to determine whether the use of microbial sealants reduces the risk of surgical site infection or not. Further rigorous, adequately-powered RCTs are required to investigate this properly."

The orthopaedic trauma literature lags behind the research performed by our arthroplasty colleagues on the topic of implant-related infections.

This bacteria-friendly, dynamic, living pluri-organism structure has the ability to morph and adapt to virtually any environment with the aim to maintain the causative organism alive. The challenges are twofold: establishing an accurate diagnosis with speciation/sensitivity and eradicating the infection. Multiple strategies have been researched to improve diagnostic accuracy, to prevent biofilm formation on orthopaedic implants, to mobilize/detach or weaken the biofilm or to target specifically bacteria embedded in the biofilm.

We aim to describe the perception of telemedicine by both surgical patients and providers to understand the preferences for future incorporation in future surgical practice.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An anonymous survey was administered to providers that transitioned clinic visits to telemedicine encounters since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second part of the study, patients who underwent video telemedicine appointments answered survey questions via telephone.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-six out of 36 (72.7%) providers responded. Over 75% reported that they could effectively communicate with patients over telemedicine. Six (23.1%) reported that they could adequately assess surgical sites. Of 361 patients, 187 consented to the study (consent rate 51.8%). Among patients, the most common result to choose a telemedicine appointment was to avoid the risk of COVID-19 transmission (84, 44.9%), though the minority reported that they would choose telemedicine after the pandemic (64, 34.2%). Those patients who would choose an in-person visit were more likely to have a higher Charlson Comorbidity Score, body mass index, and use friends or family for transportation. In open-ended feedback, patients suggested that telemedicine would be better suited for long-term follow-up rather than the immediate postoperative setting.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Patients and providers reported a high degree of satisfaction using telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic but noted concern with limited physical examinations. Telemedicine may be suited for preoperative evaluation and medium-term and long-term postoperative follow-up for surgical patients."

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation in the cardiothoracic wound cavity is used in open-heart surgery for prevention of arterial air embolism. The objective of this study was to investigate if CO2 insufflation may influence the rate of airborne contamination of the cardiothoracic wound. This was studied in a cardiothoracic wound cavity model that contained two 9 cm blood agar plates. Contamination rates were compared between a control without insufflation and insufflation with: (1) a thin open-ended tube or a gas-diffuser, (2) air or CO2, and (3) CO2 flows of 5 or 10 L/min. CO2 insufflation at 5 L/min with an open-ended tube resulted in a contamination rate almost four times that of the control (P = 0.01), whereas with the gas-diffuser the contamination rate decreased (P = 0.01). With the gas-diffuser, air insufflation at 5 L/min markedly reduced the contamination rate compared with the control (P < 0.001), but was less protective than CO2 insufflation at the same flow (P < 0.001). With both gases, the contamination rate was particularly low close to the gas-diffuser (P < 0.001). Increasing the CO2 flow from 5 to 10 L/min reduced the average contamination rate in the model from 30% to 22% (P < 0.001) of the control. At a CO2 flow of 10 L/min the contamination rate within 9 cm of the gas-diffuser was 14% of the control. Intraoperative wound ventilation with CO2 using a gas-diffuser may not only prevent air embolism, but may also significantly reduce the risk of airborne contamination and postoperative wound infection in cardiac surgery. In contrast, insufflation with an open-ended tube substantially increases these risks."

However, obesity is also associated with sternal wound infection (SWI) which is a severe complication of CABG despite advances in surgery and in infection prevention and control. Strategies to reduce the incidence of SWI are still being investigated, and we therefore conducted a retrospective study to revisit factors other than obesity associated with SWI after CABG.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      Data were extracted from the medical records of 182 patients who underwent elective on-pump CABG using one or both pedicled internal mammary artery grafts in Reims University Hospital between May 2015 and May 2016.

Obesity and preoperative anaemia were independently associated with SWI, as was the number of red blood cell (RBC) units transfused (OR 14.61 [2.64-80.75], OR 4.64 [1.61-13.34] and OR 1.27 [1.02-1.58], respectively).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The independent association of SWI with the number of RBC units transfused and the existence of preoperative anaemia and obesity suggests a mechanism of thoracic wall ischemia in SWI after CABG, thus leaving insufficient perfusion of the thoracic wall in patients with obesity.

It is not uncommon to have exposed hardware in the wound early in the course of therapy. Metal allergy must be excluded. The patient is transitioned to oral antibiotics following resolution of the acute process.

Additional unsuspected defects were found in eight cases (25.8%). The median mesh size was 140 cm2 (range, 25-375 cm2), and the median body mass index (BMI) was 28.7 kg/m2 (range, 20-37.1 kg/m2). Operations were performed or supervised by a single consultant surgeon (S.J.W.). Six postoperative seromas resolved spontaneously. Two port-site infections required oral antibiotics, and one diathermy pad burn healed with simple dressings. The median analgesia requirement was 7 days (range, 0-152 days). There were no recurrences during a median follow-up period of 15 months (range, 3-24 months). There was a saving of 616 pounds sterling per procedure.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Day case laparoscopic repair of incisional hernias is feasible and safe and has a good clinical outcome.

We also studied the genetic basis for antibiotic resistance and the genetic background of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3GC-R) Enterobacteriaceae.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Between April 2011 and April 2012, 195 patients with nosocomial surgical-site infections were consecutively recruited into the study at five surgical departments in three major tertiary care centres. Of the 165 bacterial isolates collected, most were Enterobacteriaceae (102/165, 61.8%). Of these, 65/102 (63.7%) were 3GC-R, which were characterized for resistance gene determinants and genetic background. The bla CTX-M-15 and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes were detected in all strains, usually associated with qnr genes (98.5%). Escherichia coli, the most commonly recovered species (33/65, 50.8%), occurred in six different sequence types, including the pandemic B2-O25b-ST131 group (12/33, 36.4%). Resistance transfer was studied in one representative strain of the resistance gene content in each repetitive extragenic palindromic and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence-PCR banding pattern. Plasmids were characterized by PCR-based replicon typing and sub-typing schemes. In most isolates (18/27, 66.7%), bla CTX-M-15 genes were found in incompatibility groups F/F31:A4:B1 and F/F36:A4:B1 conjugative plasmids. Horizontal transfer of both plasmids is probably an important mechanism for the spread of bla CTX-M-15 among Enterobacteriaceae species and hospitals. The presence of sets of antibiotic resistance genes in these two plasmids indicates their capacity for gene rearrangement and their evolution into new variants.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Diverse modes are involved in transmission of resistance, plasmid dissemination probably playing a major role."

            "abstract": "We sought to assess the impact of body mass index on the risk of surgical site infection in a prospective cohort study of 206 National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England between 2007 and 2011. Body mass index was available for 159,720 of 350,089 operations among patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy, coronary artery bypass graft, hip replacement, knee replacement, or large-bowel surgery. Among these patients, the risk of surgical site infection ranged from 0.65% for knee replacement to 11.04% for large-bowel surgery. Overall, 127,512 (79.8%) patients were overweight or obese (body mass index of ≥25 kg/m(2)). Obesity was associated with a 1.1-fold to 4.4-fold increase in the adjusted odds of developing surgical site infection as compared with normal weight, depending on the type of surgery. The population-attributable fraction (PAF) for body mass index was greatest in overweight (body mass index of 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)) patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft, accounting for 15% of their overall risk of surgical site infection (PAF 0.15; 95% CI 0.09-0.22). Being overweight or obese substantially increased the likelihood of patients developing surgical site infection. Given the increasingly high proportion of the surgical population who are overweight, this is likely to place a considerable additional burden on the NHS. Strategies for mitigating this excess risk need to be found."

The COVID-19 pandemic acutely stressed our established system and required us to enhance our utilization of telemedicine. We hypothesized that expansion of telemedicine to new and follow up patient visits for pediatric urology could be done effectively in a way that satisfied patient and parental expectations.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Using a pre-COVID-19 established telemedicine program based in our electronic medical record (EMR), patients and providers transitioned to primarily virtual visits when clinically appropriate. Guidelines were formulated to direct patient scheduling, provider and staff education was provided, including a process map designed for multiple providers to complete video visits (VV), and the EMR was redesigned to incorporate telehealth terminology. The number of VV per provider was recorded using the electronic medical record, and patient reported outcomes (PRO) were measured using a standardized questionnaire.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 631 VV met inclusion criteria during the period of May 2018-April 2020.

The median age of patients at time of visit was 7 years (IQR 2-12 years), median visit time was 20 min (IQR 15-30 min), and the median travel distance saved by performing a VV was 12.2 miles (IQR 6.3-26.8 miles). Diagnoses were varied and included the entire breadth of a standard pediatric urology practice. The PRO questionnaire was completed for 325 of those patient visits. Families reported a high overall satisfaction with the video visits (median score of 10 out of 10) and felt that the visit met their child's medical needs. 90% stated that they would strongly recommend a telehealth visit to other families.

            "abstract": "The clean wound infection rate is the most valuable reflection of surgical care in any hospital. Wound infection rates are seen as indicators of quality in terms of negative outcome measures. A nurse was appointed by Hairmyres and Stonehouse Hospitals NHS Trust for the purpose of surveillance of the clean surgical wound infection rate. The surveillance is based on a previous study in the USA showing that feedback of infection rates to surgeons can lead to a reduction in these rates. The specifications for surveillance were that all clean surgery would be followed up for 30 days post-operatively and that wounds with implants, i.e. vascular grafts, would be followed up for 1 year post-operatively to produce infection rates for the surgeons, wards, theatres and the infection control team. Data collection commenced in October 1995 and so far 1851 clean surgical cases have been followed up for 30 days post-operatively. All patients were monitored until discharge, then at 30 days post-operatively, and the wound scored for signs of infection. Day cases were seen within week 1 and at day 30. General practitioner and district nurse liaison enabled detection of problems at other times. The patients were given a telephone number they could use to report problems after surgery. The results show that this type of surveillance is an effective way of collecting accurate data on wound infection rates. It has enabled the early identification of problem areas in practice. The audit has also been used to facilitate the adoption of evidence-based practice, through recommendations for clean surgery, to reduce the extrinsic risk factors for wound infection. As a result of the surveillance, there has been a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in the clean wound infection rate."

In Ireland, the rate of Caesarean section (CS) is increasing, while postpartum hospital stay is decreasing, adversely affecting SSI among women. There is much need to develop post-discharge surveillance which can effectively monitor, detect, and arrange treatment for affected women. The use of modern technology to survey SSI following discharge from hospital remains unexplored. We report the results of a feasibility study which investigates whether an integrated mobile application (hereafter, app) is more cost-beneficial than a stand-alone app or telephone helpline at surveying SSI following CS. We find women prefer the integrated app (47.5%; n=116/244) over the stand-alone app (8.2%; n=20/244) and telephone helpline (18.0%; 44/244), although there is no significant difference in women's valuation of these services using willingness to pay techniques. The stand-alone app is the only cost-beneficial service due to low labour costs. Future research should employ alternative measures when evaluating the benefits of the health technology. The use of a mobile app as a mechanism for postpartum care could represent a considerable advancement towards technological health care."

It is also easy to make the connection that many post-hospital discharge surgical complications, including surgical site infections (SSIs), could be influenced or exacerbated by patient comorbidities. The authors of a recent study reported that female gender, obesity, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, critical limb ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, and neurologic disease were significant predictors of SSIs after vascular reconstruction was performed. The main concern for optimal patient care, especially in geographically isolated areas of West Virginia, is to have early, expeditious, and prompt diagnosis of complications and SSI. This adjunct to existing approaches could lead to improved outcomes and patient satisfaction, minimizing third-party interventions and decreasing the total cost of care. It seems reasonable to believe that monitoring using telehealth technology and managing the general health care of patients after a hospital vascular intervention will improve overall health and reduce 30-day readmissions and SSIs."

Superficial, deep, and organ space surgical site infections were categorized according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Deep and organ space surgical site infections were considered 1 group for this analysis because these spaces are contiguous after hysterectomy. Hospital rankings focused on deep/organ space events because the Hospital Acquired Condition Reduction program will rank and penalize based on them, not superficial surgical site infection. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression, which takes into account hospital effects, was used to identify risk factors for all surgical site infections and deep/organ space surgical site infections. Predicted to expected ratios for deep surgical site infection were calculated for each hospital and used to determine hospital rankings. Outliers were defined as those hospitals who predicted to expected confidence intervals crossed the reference line of 1. The number of outlier hospitals was compared with the number in the bottom quartile.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The overall surgical site infection rate following hysterectomy was 2.1% (351 of 16,548).

Deep surgical site infection was associated independently with younger age, longer surgical times, gynecological cancer, and open hysterectomy. There was a marginal association with blood transfusion. After risk adjustment of rates and ranking by the predicted to expected ratio, there was a change in quartile rank for 42.8% of hospitals (21 of 49). Two hospitals were identified as outliers. However, if the bottom quartile was identified, as called for by the Hospital Acquired Condition Reduction program, 10 additional hospitals would be targeted for a penalty. Hospitals with < 300 beds were most likely to see their quartile rank worsen, whereas those > 500 beds were most likely to see their quartile rank improve (P = .01).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      After adjusting for patient-related factors and site variation, more than 40% of hospitals will change quartile rank with respect to deep surgical site infection. Identifying a quartile of hospitals that are statistically different from others was not feasible in our collaborative because only 2 of 12 hospitals were outliers. These findings suggest that under the Hospital Acquired Condition Reduction program, many hospitals will be unjustly penalized."

We aimed to measure patient experience with electronic health record-integrated postoperative telemedicine encounters following thyroid and parathyroid surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this preliminary study, adult patients receiving postoperative electronic health record-integrated telemedicine video encounters or standard in-person visits after thyroid or parathyroid surgery at a single institution were prospectively enrolled from November 2019 through May 2020. Patients with home zip codes 10 to 75 miles from the medical center were included. Patient experience was assessed using the Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems Clinician & Group Visit Survey 2.0 and the Communication Assessment Tool. Top box analysis was performed, defined as the percentage of respondents who chose the most positive response score.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The cohort consisted of 45 telemedicine and 32 in-person encounters. Both groups reported similar and excellent patient experience and satisfaction (9.7 of 10 for telemedicine vs 9.8 of 10 for in-person encounters, mean difference 0.02, 95% confidence interval, [-0.25 to 0.29]). Similar surgeon communication performance was observed (mean Communication Assessment Tool top box score 83% telemedicine vs 86% in-person, mean difference 3%, 95% confidence interval [-10% to 17%]). Nonlinear increases in monthly telemedicine encounter volume were observed within the section of endocrine surgery (3-fold increase) and the health system (125-fold increase) from November 2019 to May 2020.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Patients who underwent cervical endocrine surgery reported similarly high rates of satisfaction and excellent surgeon communication following either telemedicine or in-person postoperative encounters. Electronic health record-integrated telemedicine for a subset of low-risk procedures can act as a suitable replacement for in-person encounters. A surge in telemedicine use, stimulated by the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, was experienced at our institution."

            "abstract": "The association of hyperglycemia with postoperative infectious complications after foot and ankle surgery has been well studied. However, many surgeons in their current practice use the somewhat arbitrary cutoff of 7% glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as the level above which surgery is considered unsafe and conducive to complications. Our goal in the present study was to assess the relationship between the HbA1c levels and the rate of postoperative infection to begin to determine whether 7% is a suitable cutoff or whether this level needs to be reevaluated. Furthermore, we were interested in the general trends relating to the infection rates and preoperative HbA1c levels. Our preliminary, subjective, analysis has indicated that infection rates increase steadily as the HbA1c increases toward 7.3%, increase rapidly at an HbA1c of 7.3% to 9.8%, and then level off. Additional study is warranted to better understand the role played by other covariates in determining the infection rate and to investigate whether patient selection has influenced the appearance of decreased infection rates at high HbA1c levels. Additional study could also assess similar relationships for other types of complication, such as nonunion, and perhaps examine different foot and ankle procedures in isolation."

A cardiac surgeon noted a cluster of serious infections leading to wound dehiscence, despite the fact that none of his colleagues had noticed a rise in infection rates. The infections were predominantly with Enterobacter cloacae, and molecular typing and serotyping showed these isolates to be indistinguishable. Observation of the surgeon's practice revealed nothing untoward, and there were no infections among his patients operated on in another hospital. There appeared to be no significant difference between the modes of operation of the different surgeons. The operating theatres were screened to exclude an environmental source, with samples cultured on CHROMagar Orientation, a selective/differential medium designed for urine samples. Further questioning revealed one difference between the practices of the different surgeons; this surgeon used semi-frozen Hartmann's solution to achieve cardioplegia. The freezer used for this was swabbed and yielded E. cloacae, indistinguishable from the clinical isolates. It is hypothesized that this organism contaminated the freezer, and that the contamination was passed on to the ice/slush solution, thus infecting the patients. There have been no more cases since the freezer was replaced, a rigorous cleaning schedule instituted, and steps taken to reduce the possibility of any further contamination."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Many people undergo surgical operations during their life-time, which result in surgical wounds. After an operation the incision is closed using stiches, staples, steri-strips or an adhesive glue. Usually, towards the end of the surgical procedure and before the patient leaves the operating theatre, the surgeon covers the closed surgical wound using gauze and adhesive tape or an adhesive tape containing a pad (a wound dressing) that covers the surgical wound. There is currently no guidance about when the wound can be made wet by post-operative bathing or showering. Early bathing may encourage early mobilisation of the patient, which is good after most types of operation. Avoiding post-operative bathing or showering for two to three days may result in accumulation of sweat and dirt on the body. Conversely, early washing of the surgical wound may have an adverse effect on healing, for example by irritating or macerating the wound, and disturbing the healing environment.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To compare the benefits (such as potential improvements to quality of life) and harms (potentially increased wound-related morbidity) of early post-operative bathing or showering (i.e. within 48 hours after surgery, the period during which epithelialisation of the wound occurs) compared with delayed post-operative bathing or showering (i.e. no bathing or showering for over 48 hours after surgery) in patients with closed surgical wounds.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register;The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; EBSCO CINAHL; the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We considered all randomised trials conducted in patients who had undergone any surgical procedure and had surgical closure of their wounds, irrespective of the location of the wound and whether or not the wound was dressed. We excluded trials if they included patients with contaminated, dirty or infected wounds and those that included open wounds. We also excluded quasi-randomised trials, cohort studies and case-control studies.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We extracted data on the characteristics of the patients included in the trials, risk of bias in the trials and outcomes from each trial. For binary outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous variables we planned to calculate the mean difference (MD), or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI. For count data outcomes, we planned to calculate the rate ratio (RaR) with 95% CI. We used RevMan 5 software for performing these calculations.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Only one trial was identified for inclusion in this review. This trial was at a high risk of bias. This trial included 857 patients undergoing minor skin excision surgery in the primary care setting. The wounds were sutured after the excision. Patients were randomised to early post-operative bathing (dressing to be removed after 12 hours and normal bathing resumed) (n = 415) or delayed post-operative bathing (dressing to be retained for at least 48 hours before removal and resumption of normal bathing) (n = 442). The only outcome of interest reported in this trial was surgical site infection (SSI). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who developed SSIs between the two groups (857 patients; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.48). The proportions of patients who developed SSIs were 8.5% in the early bathing group and 8.8% in the delayed bathing group.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is currently no conclusive evidence available from randomised trials regarding the benefits or harms of early versus delayed post-operative showering or bathing for the prevention of wound complications, as the confidence intervals around the point estimate are wide, and, therefore, a clinically significant increase or decrease in SSI by early post-operative bathing cannot be ruled out. We recommend running further randomised controlled trials to compare early versus delayed post-operative showering or bathing."

However, most research has focused on patient and procedural risk factors. Understanding how structural and process variables influence infection is vital to identify targets for effective interventions and to optimize healthcare services. The aim of this study was to systematically review the association between hospital characteristics and surgical site infection in colorectal surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Main body:\n        \n      \n      A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases until the 31st of May, 2021. The search strategy followed the Participants, Exposure/Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes and Study design. The primary outcome of interest was surgical site infection rate after colorectal surgery. Studies were grouped into nine risk factor typologies: hospital size, ownership affiliation, being an oncological hospital, safety-net burden, hospital volume, surgeon caseload, discharge destination and time since implementation of surveillance. The STROBE statement was used for evaluating the methodological quality. A total of 4703 records were identified, of which 172 were reviewed and 16 were included. Studies were published between 2008 and 2021, and referred to data collected between 1996 and 2016. Surgical site infection incidence ranged from 3.2 to 27.6%. Two out of five studies evaluating hospital size adjusted the analysis to patient and procedure-related risk factors, and showed that larger hospitals were either positively associated or had no association with SSI. Public hospitals did not present significantly different infection rates than private or non-profit ones. Medical school affiliation and higher safety-net burden were associated with higher surgical site infection (crude estimates), while oncological hospitals were associated with higher incidence independently of other variables. Hospital caseload showed mixed results, while surgeon caseload and surveillance time since implementation appear to be associated with fewer infections.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although there are few studies addressing hospital-level factors on surgical site infection, surgeon experience and the implementation of a surveillance system appear to be associated with better outcomes.

            "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for surgical site or wound complications in women undergoing surgery involving vertical incisions. Several investigators have reported the efficacy of subcutaneous drains in minimising the complication rate but there is no consensus on using these for surgery in obese patients. In 2006, the Scottish Surveillance of Healthcare Associated Infection Programme showed that using subcuticular sutures rather than staples to close incisions significantly reduced the risk of surgical site infection. Before January 2008 (group 1; N = 40), wound complications occurred in some obese patients in our hospital after obstetric and gynaecological surgery when only staples were used for skin closure. In January 2008 (group 2; N = 31), we changed the method of skin closure for obese patients [body mass index (BMI) > 28 kg/m(2)] and we now use a subcutaneous drain with four channels along the running tube and subcuticular sutures with interrupted, buried 4-0 polydioxanone sutures. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of these interventions for skin closure in obese women. The general characteristics (age, weight and BMI) were similar between the two groups. There were no wound complications in group 2. In group 1, wound disruptions and a seroma occurred in five (12.5%) and one (2.5%) patients, respectively. The wound complication rate in group 2 was significantly lower than that in group 1 (P = 0.0319). Thus, new materials and techniques for skin closure can reduce the wound complication rate in obese women."

Until now, the care for wounds after surgery still remain a tedious and challenging work for the medical personnel and patients. As a result, with the help of the hand-held mobile devices, there is high demand for the development of a series of algorithms and related methods for wound infection early detection and wound self monitoring.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This research proposed an automated way to perform (1) wound image segmentation and (2) wound infection assessment after surgical operations. The first part describes an edge-based self-adaptive threshold detection image segmentation method to exclude nonwounded areas from the original images. The second part describes a wound infection assessment method based on machine learning approach. In this method, the extraction of feature points from the suture area and an optimal clustering method based on unimodal Rosin threshold algorithm that divides feature points into clusters are introduced. These clusters are then merged into several regions of interest (ROIs), each of which is regarded as a suture site.

            "abstract": "Background: Within the United States, surgical site infections (SSIs) have now become the most common hospital-acquired infection and impact 2%-5% of all surgical patients. It is estimated that approximately 60% of SSIs could be prevented through improved adherence to pre-existing practice guidelines. Methods: The myriad of contributing factors leading to SSIs highlights the need for a multi-faceted approach. Although collaboration and coordination among providers and patients represents a requirement of any sustainable solution, it also creates a space and possible role for innovative technologies and mobile applications utilizing patient-generated health data (PGHD). Results: Upon analysis of hospital practice, we have identified substantial variability in documentation, peri-operative care, and post-discharge instruction with regard to SSI prevention and incision care techniques. This variability is further exacerbated by a loss of information within each transition of patient care. As a result, a patient's risk of SSI often becomes dictated by their provider's preferred (and sometimes arbitrary) peri-operative practices and their own initiative in following poorly explained pre-operative instructions. The quality and efficiency of any subsequent SSI treatment similarly rests on a seemingly inconsistent approach with poor patient instruction for the post-discharge setting. Conclusions: Surgical site infection risk can be mitigated successfully through reliable performance of several evidence-based process measures within the operating room, which are now at the guideline level. However, optimal performance only happens when teams and patients are aligned and truly believe both that the evidence is correct, and that SSIs are preventable. The journey toward this goal will be an iterative process that may take months to years. Although technology can be complementary, it cannot replace human passion for harm prevention."

Using a matched cohort of patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery (101 cases and 904 controls), we built a prediction model for post-operative surgical site infections (SSIs) using Gaussian process (GP) regression, time warping and imputation methods to manage the sparsity of the data source, and support vector machines for classification. For most blood tests, wider confidence intervals after imputation were obtained in patients with SSI.

Two Veterans' Affairs (VA) medical centers and two specialties (plastic surgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation) participated in the study. Study patients included inpatients and outpatients with pressure ulcers of stage II, III, or IV, plus outpatients with diabetic foot ulcers or venous stasis ulcers. All patients were assessed both in-person (the \"gold standard\") and with the telemedicine system using yes/no responses and a 5-point scale, respectively, on four diagnostic questions concerning wound healing and infection, based on AHCPR guidelines. A total of 70 patients were enrolled, with data collected on 430 visits: up to 6 visits per wound. Percentage agreement for all visits ranged from 67.1 for \"not healing\" to 88.8 for \"cellulitis present.\" Sensitivity ranged from 0.32 for cellulitis to 0.63 for necrosis; and specificity ranged from 0.80 for necrosis to 0.91 for cellulitis. Although agreement of the telemedicine system was not high, it was not significantly less than interphysician agreement on in-person assessments. A relatively inexpensive store-and-forward telemedicine system for monitoring the status of chronic wounds has the potential to improve access to specialty care for patients who are not currently receiving routine monitoring by specialized nurses or physicians."

            "abstract": "One of the main objectives of our 3-dimensional (3D) computer-assisted functional endoscopic sinus surgery was to design a computer-assisted 3D approach to the presurgical planning, intraoperative guidance, and postoperative analysis of the anatomic regions of the nose and paranasal sinuses. Such an extremely powerful approach should allow better insight into the operating field, thereby significantly increasing the safety of the procedure. The last step to implementing the technology in the operating room was to connect the computer workstations and video equipment to remote locations by using a high-speed, wide-bandwidth computer network. During patient preparation, the surgeon in the operating room consulted remote experienced and skillful surgeons by viewing CT images and 3D models on computer workstations. The surgeon and consultants used software for CT image previews and 3D model manipulations on top of collaboration tools to define the pathosis, produce an optimal path to the pathosis, and decide how to perform the real surgical procedure. With tele-flythrough or tele-virtual endoscopy rendered through the use of 3D models, both surgeons can preview all the characteristics of the region (ie, anatomy, pathosis) and so predict and determine the next steps of the operation. This ensures greater safety thanks to the operation guidance and reduces the possibility of intraoperative error. The duration of the teleconsultation is thus shortened, which may prove the greatest benefit of tele-3D computer-assisted surgery. If this method were used, clinical institutions would spend less money for telesurgical consultation."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      An unsettled controversy over the appropriate surgical approach in cases of cervical radiculopathy caused by degenerative vertebrae and intervertebral discs is still present. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of microsurgical posterior foraminotomy in the treatment of cervical radiculopathy and to find out whether the underlying pathology (soft disc herniation/spondylosis) is of value in predicting long-term outcome after this procedure.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients, who underwent posterior cervical foraminotomy (PCF) at our department between 2006 and 2013 for unilateral mono-segmental lateral soft disc herniation, or spondylosis, or both, were enrolled in this study. Demographic, clinical and surgical data were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were subsequently interviewed by telephone to identify their long-term outcome. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using Odom's criteria. Descriptive statistics were frequencies and percentage of occurrence for categorical variables and mean and range for continuous variables.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One hundred eighty-one patients were included in this study, with a median follow-up of 58 months (mean 43 months, range 12-96 months). The overall re-operation rate was 7.2% (13 patients); 11 patients (6%) for recurrent root symptoms due to recurrent disc herniation (six patients, 3.3%) and re-stenosis (five patients, 2.8%), one patient (0.55%) for wound infection and one patient (0.55%) for postoperative haematoma. Among the eleven patients who underwent re-operation for recurrent root symptoms there was one patient who additionally had persistent cerebrospinal fluid leak and superficial posterior wound infection. There was no significant difference between lateral soft disc herniation and spondylosis in term of re-operation rate. At discharge, excellent or good outcome was achieved in 89% of patients; the long-term success rate was 97.2% using Odom's criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Microsurgical PCF is an effective technique for treating lateral spinal root compression. Proper patient selection is obligatory to achieve the best results."

One hundred and eleven patients underwent elective surgical procedures by the same surgeon using either octyl-2-cyanoacrylate or sutures for skin closure at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Most patients underwent excision of benign skin lesions with a mean wound size of 112 mm3. Patients were randomized into either control (vertical mattress suture closure) or test groups (closure with octyl-2-cyanoacrylate). Surgical judgment was used to determine which wounds in each group required application of subcutaneous sutures to relieve tension and aid in skin edge eversion. Generally, full-thickness (through dermis) wounds larger than 1 cm3 required the use of subcutaneous sutures. The time required to close the epidermis with suture (mean, 3 minutes and 47 seconds) was about four times that of octyl-2-cyanoacrylate (mean, 55 seconds). Wounds were evaluated at 5 to 7 days for infection, wound dehiscence, or tissue reaction, and at 90 days using the modified Hollander wound evaluation scale. At 1 year, photographs of the wounds were evaluated by two facial plastic surgeons that graded the cosmetic outcome using a previously validated visual analog scale. There were no instances of wound dehiscence, hematoma, or infection in either group. Results of wound evaluation at 90 days determined by the modified Hollander scal revealed equivalent cosmetic results in both groups. Results of the visual analog scale ratings showed scores of 21.7 +/- 16.3 for the 49 patients treated with octyl-2-cyanoacrylate and 29.2 +/- 17.7 for the 51 control patients treated with sutures. The lower visual analog scale score represented a superior cosmetic outcome at 1 year with the octyl-2-cyanoacrylate as compared with sutures. This difference is statistically significant at p = 0.03. Additionally, patient satisfaction was very high in the group treated with octyl-2-cyanoacrylate."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pledged payment for telehealth visits for the duration of this public health emergency in an effort to decrease COVID-19 transmission and allow for deployment of residents and attending physicians to support critical-care services. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has vastly expanded telehealth use, no studies to our knowledge have analyzed the implementation and success of telehealth for orthopaedic trauma. This population is unique in that patients who have experienced orthopaedic trauma range in age from early childhood to late adulthood, they vary across the socioeconomic spectrum, may need to undergo emergent or urgent surgery, often have impaired mobility, and, historically, do not always follow-up consistently with healthcare providers.\n    \n\n\n          Questions/purposes:\n        \n      \n      (1) To what extent did telehealth usage increase for an outpatient orthopaedic trauma clinic at a Level 1 trauma center from the month before the COVID-19 stay-at-home order compared with the month immediately following the order? (2) What is the proportion of no-show visits before and after the implementation of telehealth?\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      After nonurgent clinic visits were postponed, telehealth visits were offered to all patients due to the COVID-19 stay-at-home order. Patients with internet access who had the ability to download the MyChart application on their mobile device and agreed to a telehealth visit were seen virtually between March 16, 2020 and April 10, 2020 (COVID-19) by three attending orthopaedic trauma surgeons at a large, urban, Level 1 trauma center. Clinic schedules and patient charts were reviewed to determine clinical volumes and no-show proportions. The COVID-19 period was compared with the 4 weeks before March 16, 2020 (pre-COVID-19), when all visits were conducted in-person. The overall clinic volume decreased from 340 to 233 (31%) between the two periods. The median (range) age of telehealth patients was 46 years (20 to 89). Eighty-four percent (72 of 86) of telehealth visits were postoperative and established nonoperative patient visits, and 16% (14 of 86) were new-patient visits. To avoid in-person suture or staple removal, patients seen for their 2-week postoperative visit had either absorbable closures, staples, or nonabsorbable sutures removed by a home health registered nurse or skilled nursing facility registered nurse. If radiographs were indicated, they were obtained at outside facilities or our institution before patients returned home for their telehealth visit.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was an increase in the percentage of office visits conducted via telehealth between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods (0% [0 of 340] versus 37% [86 of 233]; p < 0.001), and by the third week of implementation, telehealth comprised approximately half of all clinic visits (57%; [30 of 53]). There was no difference in the no-show proportion between the two periods (13% [53 of 393] for the pre-COVID-19 period and 14% [37 of 270] for the COVID-19 period; p = 0.91).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Clinicians should consider implementing telehealth strategies to provide high-quality care for patients and protect the workforce during a pandemic. In a previously telehealth-naïve clinic, we show successful implementation of telehealth for a diverse orthopaedic trauma population that historically has issues with mobility and follow-up. Our strategies include postponing long-term follow-up visits, having sutures or staples removed by a home health or skilled nursing facility registered nurse, having patients obtain pertinent imaging before the visit, and ensuring that patients have access to mobile devices and internet connectivity. Future studies should evaluate the incidence of missed infections or stiffness as a result of telehealth, analyze the subset of patients who may be more vulnerable to no-shows or technological failures, and conduct patient surveys to determine the factors that contribute to patient preferences for or against the use of telehealth.\n    \n\n\n          Level of evidence:\n        \n      \n      Level III, therapeutic study."

Local antimicrobial delivery may reduce the risk of SSI by increasing drug concentrations and distribution in vulnerable surgical sites compared to what is achieved using systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis alone. In this work, we describe a comprehensive in vivo evaluation of the safety and efficacy of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-dimethylbutyrolactone acrylamide-co-Jeffamine M-1000 acrylamide) [PNDJ], an injectable temperature-responsive hydrogel carrier for antimicrobial delivery in surgical sites. Biodistribution data indicate that PNDJ is primarily cleared via the liver and kidneys following drug delivery. Antimicrobial-loaded PNDJ was generally well-tolerated locally and systemically when applied in bone, muscle, articulating joints, and intraperitoneal space, although mild renal toxicity consistent with the released antimicrobials was identified at high doses in rats. Dosing of PNDJ at bone-implant interfaces did not affect normal tissue healing and function of orthopedic implants in a transcortical plug model in rabbits and in canine total hip arthroplasty. Finally, PNDJ was effective at preventing recurrence of implant-associated MSSA and MRSA osteomyelitis in rabbits, showing a trend toward outperforming commercially available antimicrobial-loaded bone cement and systemic antimicrobial administration. These studies indicate that antimicrobial-loaded PNDJ hydrogels are well-tolerated and could reduce incidence of SSI in a variety of surgical procedures."

            "title": "Bacterial Contribution in Chronicity of Wounds.",
            "abstract": "A wound is damage of a tissue usually caused by laceration of a membrane, generally the skin. Wound healing is accomplished in three stages in healthy individuals, including inflammatory, proliferative, and remodeling stages. Healing of wounds normally starts from the inflammatory phase and ends up in the remodeling phase, but chronic wounds remain in an inflammatory stage and do not show progression due to some specific reasons. Chronic wounds are classified in different categories, such as diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), venous leg ulcers (VLU) and pressure ulcer (PU), surgical site infection (SSI), abscess, or trauma ulcers. Globally, the incidence rate of DFU is 1-4 % and prevalence rate is 5.3-10.5 %. However, colonization of pathogenic bacteria at the wound site is associated with wound chronicity. Most chronic wounds contain more than one bacterial species and produce a synergetic effect that results in previously non-virulent bacterial species becoming virulent and causing damage to the host. While investigating bacterial diversity in chronic wounds, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Peptoniphilus, Enterobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Finegoldia, and Serratia were found most frequently in chronic wounds. Recently, it has been observed that bacteria in chronic wounds develop biofilms that contribute to a delay in healing. In a mature biofilm, bacteria grow slowly due to deficiency of nutrients that results in the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. The present review reflects the reasons why acute wounds become chronic. Interesting findings include the bacterial load, which forms biofilms and shows high-level resistance toward antibiotics, which is a threat to human health in general and particularly to some patients who have acute wounds."

            "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is continuously increasing among bacterial clinical isolates (especially methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), negatively impacting on outcomes of patients with Surgical Site Infections (SSIs). A multi-disciplinary team work is essential for SSIs prevention and for the choice of antibiotic therapy of orthopaedic SSIs. In particular, an Antibiotic Stewardship (AS) approach is recommended for preserving the activity of old and new antimicrobials. Dalbavancin is a novel antimicrobial agent, belonging to the lipoglycopeptides family, recently approved by FDA for the treatment of ABSSSIs (Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections) and can be considered as a candidate for the treatment of orthopaedic superficial SSIs. An antimicrobial activity directed against MRSA and other multi-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, a bactericidal effect and an extremely extended half-life are among key features of this drug. Dalbavancin gives to clinicians the option to provide an intravenous antimicrobial agent shown to be as effective as conventional therapies, without requiring prolonged admission into the hospital, drastically reducing the length of hospital stay (without reducing the treatment compliance) and total cost per patient. In this paper, we analyze general, microbiological and pharmacological features of dalbavancin, aiming at supporting clinicians while positioning this drug in the context of orthopaedic SSIs."

In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, significant predictors of MRSA SSI in cancer patients were antibiotics use <24 h of surgery and progressive cancer. No surgical factors (i.e., procedure time or timing of perioperative antibiotics) were associated with increased risk of MRSA SSI.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Several clinical and postoperative factors were associated with increased risk of MRSA SSI in cancer patients, but antibiotic use before surgery (especially quinolones) and progressive cancer were the only independent predictors."

Different risk factors may be involved, including age, sex, nutrition and immunity, prophylactic antibiotics, operation type and duration, type of shaving, and secondary infections. This study aimed to determine the risk factors affecting abdominal surgical site infections and their incidence at Imam Khomeini, a major referral teaching hospital in Iran.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients (n = 802) who had undergone abdominal surgery were studied and the relationships among variables were analyzed by Student's t and Chi-square tests. The subjects were followed for 30 days and by a 20-item questionnaire. Data were collected through pre- and post-operative examinations and telephone follow-ups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 802 patients, 139 suffered from SSI (17.4%). In 40.8% of the cases, the wound was dirty infected. The average age for the patients was 46.7 years. The operations were elective in 75.7% of the cases and 24.7% were urgent. The average duration of the operation was 2.24 hours, the average duration of pre-operative hospital stay 4.31 days and the average length of (pre- and post-operation) hospital stay 11.2 days. Three quarters of the cases were shaved 12 hours before the operation. The increased operation time, increased bed stay, electivity of the operation, septicity of the wound, type of incision, the administration of prophylactic antibiotic, type of operation, background disease, and the increased time lapse between shaving and operation all significantly associated with SSI with a p-value less than 0.001.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In view of the high rate of SSI reported here (17.4% compared with the 14% quoted in literature), this study suggests that by reducing the average operation time to less than 2 hours, the average preoperative stay to 4 days and the overall stay to less than 11 days, and approximating the timing of shaving to the operation and substituting cefazolin for cefaluthin when prophylactic antibiotic is to be administered, the SSI may be reduced to a more acceptable level."

            "abstract": "Background: Posterior sagittal anorectoplasty (PSARP) has been the standard for management of children with high anorectal malformations (ARMs). Recently, there has been an increase in the use of laparoscopy in its management. We analyzed the outcomes of laparoscopically assisted anorectal pull-through (LAARP) compared to PSARP using a large inpatient database. Methods: Kids' Inpatient Database was analyzed for ARM (ICD-9-CM 751.2) between 1997 and 2012. Perineal fistulas and low/intermediate ARM were excluded. Propensity score (PS)-matched analyses were performed using 37 variables. Cases were weighted to provide national estimates. Results: Of the overall 29,106 cases, 7428 patients <2 years underwent surgical repair. LAARP was performed in 178 patients. Eighty-eight percent were male. Most were of Caucasian (n = 71; 45%), followed by Hispanic (n = 41; 26%) descent. Most were performed in 2009 and 2012 (n = 149; 83%). Most were covered by Medicaid (88; 49%), followed by private insurance (80; 45%). Median length of stay (LOS) was 4 (interquartile range = 3) days. The majority were performed in a children's hospital (n = 90; 88%). On PS-matched analysis, LAARP had shorter median LOS (4 [3]) compared to PSARP (6 [15]) days, P = .003. Rates of reoperation, wound infection, wound dehiscence, and mortality were unchanged between approaches. Cost was lower for LAARP (47,969 [49,450]) versus PSARP (56,110 [160,314]) U.S. dollar , P = .002, whereas total charges did not differ significantly. Conclusions: A minimal access approach to a complex procedure requires significant time and resources to be adopted as standard. PSARP is an important example, as increased availability of laparoscopy, and therefore, access to the procedure for patients will greatly affect resource utilization and recovery for the patient. As demonstrated, the LOS and cost is significantly lower for the LAARP procedure in comparison to the traditional approach. Future research will clarify boundaries to introducing the laparoscopic approach as a potential standard technique in the next decade."

Patient and procedural determinants of combined preparation receipt remain understudied. Patients and Methods: All patients undergoing elective colectomy within the 2018 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) Participant Use File and Targeted Colectomy datasets were included. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with receipt of combined preparation. Results: A total of 21,889 patients were included, of whom 13,848 (63.2%) received combined preparation pre-operatively. Patients who received combined preparation tended to be younger, male, of white race, and of non-Hispanic ethnicity (all p < 0.05). After multivariable adjustment, male gender, body mass index (BMI) 30-39 kg/m2, independent functional status, and laparoscopic and robotic surgical approaches were associated with receipt of combined preparation (all p < 0.05), whereas Asian race, hypertension, disseminated cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease were associated with omission of combined preparation (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Patients with risk factors for infectious complications-including a poor functional status, comorbid conditions, and undergoing an open procedure-are less likely to receive combined preparation before elective colectomy. Similarly, female and Asian patients are less likely to receive combined preparation, emphasizing the need for equitable administration of combined preparation."

Four teleconsultations were organized between departments of maxillofacial surgery in Caen (France) and in Bamako (Mali). 21 patients were assessed regarding their care. The preparation phase, taking place several weeks before the mission, allowed us to meet the patients preselected by Prof Traore. We were also able to review imaging, such as previous X-rays or preoperative CT scans. After discussion between the two teams, a decision on the coordination of patient care was reached, namely surgery performed by Prof Traore and the local team in Bamako, or surgery during the next mission to Ouagadougou. Several weeks after the mission, patients attended postoperative consultation by means of teleconsultation. This covered wound assessment, management of complications, and scheduling of follow-up surgery. The benefits of telemedicine in humanitarian projects are manifold: real-time exchange of specialist skills with Malian colleagues, collective therapeutic decisions, academic value, and anticipation of anesthetic and surgical needs before missions."

However, S. aureus is also the commonest cause of surgical site infection (SSI) and is a major cause of bloodstream infection (BSI). The development of staphylococcal infection arises from a combination of bacterial factors, e.g. production of toxins and host factors, including underlying patient disease, e.g. diabetes mellitus. The surveillance of SSI and BSI are increasingly components of national quality programmes to reduce healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) in the UK, Ireland and beyond and the proportion of S. aureus BSI due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has declined in recent years but not necessarily that due to methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. However, the complexity and sophistication of the staphylococcal genome has enabled it to change and adapt to varying circumstances such as exposure to a new antibiotic, adherence to a biomedical device and transfer from an animal to a human host. The future will perhaps see more cases of community-acquired MRSA and which may become endemic in hospitals and cause HCAI, technology becoming available to rapidly detect, type and characterise isolates for resistance and virulence and finally greater efforts at local and national level to drive down infection rates.

As mandated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the need and function of the surgeons' gown barrier is a given. Initially the gown was used to protect the patient from members of the surgical team; its role now is to protect the surgical team members from the patient and the hazards associated with exposure to bloodborne pathogens. As for barrier drapes (i.e., patient, Mayo stand, back table covers), considering the influence of today's antibiotics and the advent of minimally invasive surgical techniques on the incidence of postoperative infection, just how necessary are they? Initially the use of barrier drapes was viewed as a reasonable practice. The problem, however, with any reasonable type of practice of this nature is identifying the kind and quality of supporting evidence and testing the practice itself. If there is no evidence for or against a practice; its advocates make up the process as they go along. In the case of barrier drapes, there were individuals who assumed that there were studies that conclusively demonstrated their need, even though they never sought confirmation to that effect. In the process, whether the drapes were cost-effective escaped criticism, and their use survived over the years because of the \"that's the way we've always done it\" syndrome. In a comprehensive examination of draping practices written 60 years ago, a physician discusses the myriad sources of contamination that could contribute to postoperative infection. He concluded that \"to minimize the chances of contamination, all of these sources must be separately and individually studied.\" In terms of the influence of barrier surgical drapes, there remains a need for unbiased, statistically valid, conclusive research. Until such data become available, their use cannot be indisputably defended."

The surgical table was split in thirds: the surgeon's side, the C-arm side of the operative field, and the middle for contamination analysis. Fluorescent powder was used to simulate a contaminant and placed on the C-arm, floor and lower portions of drapes. The C-arm was cycled between PA and Lateral positions. Powder transfer to the field was visualized with a camera under uniform UV light. Photographs were taken to measure fluorescent pixels prior to cycling the C-arm and at 5, 10 and 15 cycles. This protocol was repeated using a split sheet (U-drape) to isolate the C-arm below the operative field.

Telehealth technology to monitor patients, especially those in geographically isolated areas, may reduce post-operative complications and improve health and financial outcomes. The primary objective of this study was to compare outcomes between patients who received TeleHealth Electronic Monitoring (THEM) and those with routine discharge instructions and no monitoring, Standard Of Care (SOC).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This is a prospective randomized study of vascular surgery patients with infrainguinal incisions. THEM patients received a tablet and home monitoring devices that transmitted information to care managers. Monitoring tools included image capture, weight scales, blood pressure cuffs, thermometers, and oxygen saturation monitors. Care managers used the TeleMed 2020 Enform™ platform to review alerts, real-time patient data, and dialogue with the care team.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eighty patients were screened and 30 enrolled, of which 16 (53.3%) were randomized to the THEM group and 14 (46.7%) to the control group.

There were no significant differences in wound or 30-day readmissions (THEM 6.3% vs. SOC 7.1%, P = 1.000).

To be useful for regional or national audit the method must be effective, inexpensive, and acceptable to patients. We assessed the role of telephone calls to patients in PDS of SSI in 3150 patients in 32 Scottish hospitals undergoing groin hernia repair during one year. Overall, 104 (3.3%) patients opted out of the audit by declining to give a contact telephone number, 96 (3.0%) could not provide a personal telephone contact number, and 12 could not be contacted, a compliance rate of 93.3%. Two thousand, nine hundred and thirty-eight patients were contacted at one or all of the call points, i.e. 10, 20, or 30 days postoperatively, from a single call centre by medical records clerks, working to a piloted protocol. Contact data, including contact at all three time points are available on 2665 (84.6%) patients. All patients who believed their wound to be infected were seen by a healthcare worker (HCW) to confirm or refute the diagnosis. Of the 2665 patients in whom complete data are available, 140 (5.3%) patients developed confirmed wound infection and a further 57 (2.1%) thought their wound was infected, but this was not confirmed by the HCW. Patients appeared to welcome the concept of telephone contact. Methods for identifying all patients eligible for surveillance need to be improved.

            "abstract": "Staggering statistics regarding the global burden of disease due to lack of surgical care worldwide has been gaining attention in the global health literature over the last 10 years. The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery reported that 16.9 million lives were lost due to an absence of surgical care in 2010, equivalent to 33% of all deaths worldwide. Although data from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are limited, recent investigations, such as the African Surgical Outcomes Study, highlight that despite operating on low risk patients, there is increased postoperative mortality in LMICs versus higher-resource settings, a majority of which occur secondary to seemingly preventable complications like surgical site infections. We propose that implementing creative, low-cost surgical outcomes monitoring and select quality improvement systems proven effective in high-income countries, such as surgical infection prevention programs and safety checklists, can enhance the delivery of safe surgical care in existing LMIC surgical systems. While efforts to initiate and expand surgical access and capacity continues to deserve attention in the global health community, here we advocate for creative modifications to current service structures, such as promoting a culture of safety, employing technology and mobile health (mHealth) for patient data collection and follow-up, and harnessing partnerships for information sharing, to create a framework for improving morbidity and mortality in responsible, scalable, and sustainable ways."

In the univariate and the multivariate analyses for perioperative risk factors for I-SSI, the use of WP was an independent favorable factor that reduced the incidence of I-SSI (odds ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.55-0.98. P = 0.038). The subgroup forest plot analyses revealed that WP reduced the risk of I-SSI only in patients aged 74 years or younger, males, non-obese patients (body mass index <25 kg/m2), patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 1/2, patients with a previous history of laparotomy, non-smokers, and patients who underwent colon and rectum operations. In patients who underwent colorectal surgery, the postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in patients with WP than those without WP (median 13 vs. 15 days, P = 0.040). In terms of the depth of SSI, WP only prevented superficial I-SSI and did not reduce the incidence of deep I-SSI.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      WP is a useful device for preventing superficial I-SSI in open elective digestive surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration number:\n        \n      \n      UMIN000004723."

Bacteriological study was performed at the Institut Pasteur in Bangui. During the study period, 278 cases were included (207 were male and 71 were female) and 51 SSI (18%) were diagnosed among which 48 cases during hospitalization and only 3 cases after discharge. The infections were superficial in 31 cases (61%) and deep in 20 cases (39%) and often requiring new surgery procedure. The following factors were found to be predictive for a SSI: Altemeier class and a long time of surgery procedure. No difference in the frequency of SSI was noted in patients who received antibioprophylaxy or not. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus was the most frequent species isolated in SSI, followed by Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. A strain of E. cloacae harbouring an extended spectrum beta-Lactamase was also identified. SSI occurs at very high frequency in our practice in the \"Hôpital Communautaire de Bangui\", CAR. The antibioprophylaxy scheme used in our hospital (generally penicillin G), is not adapted to prevent SSI.

The global trend towards reducing length of hospital stay post-surgery and the increase in day case surgery means that surgical site infections (SSI) will increasingly occur after hospital discharge.

Preoperative bathing or showering is widely recommended to reduce the risk of surgical site infections. Evidence of the impact of this measure on surgical site infection rates is mixed, and further prospective trials comparing standardized protocols for showering with plain soap or chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)-containing soap, or bathing with 2% CHG-impregnated cloths are needed to establish the most effective approach. Current evidence favors the use of alcohol-containing solutions, often containing CHG or povidone-iodine, for surgical site preparation of the skin. Preparation of vaginal mucosa prior to gynecologic surgery may be performed using either povidone-iodine or CHG. Surgical hand antisepsis can be performed by scrubbing with an antimicrobial soap or by handrubbing using an alcohol-based handrub. Addition of CHG to alcohol-based handrubs intended for surgical hand antisepsis is not necessary if they meet recommended efficacy criteria. Daily CHG bathing of intensive care unit patients has been shown to reduce a variety of health care-associated infections, most commonly bloodstream infections (BSIs). Achieving and maintaining optimum application protocols may be challenging, suggesting the need for ongoing staff education, monitoring, and feedback. Additional studies are needed to determine the impact of daily CHG bathing of non-intensive care unit patients. Alcoholic CHG is currently the preferred antiseptic for skin preparation prior to insertion of central and arterial intravascular catheters. CHG-impregnated dressings have been shown to reduce catheter-associated BSI. Because of the widespread use of antiseptics, especially CHG, surveillance for emergence of increased tolerance or resistance is warranted. Antiseptics are applied to the skin for a variety of purposes in health care. Common scenarios in which topical antiseptics are used include preoperative bathing, surgical site preparation, surgical hand hygiene, daily bathing of intensive care unit patients, and prevention of intravascular catheter-associated BSI.

Advances in control of infections have not completely eradicated this problem because of development of drug resistance. Antimicrobial resistance can increase complications and costs associated with procedures and treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      A study was carried out on drug sensitivity patterns of bacterial isolates from septic postoperative wounds in Jinja hospital, Uganda. This study was designed to determine the distribution of bacterial pathogens isolated from septic post-operative wounds and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Specimens of pus swabs were collected aseptically and analysed in the laboratory. Colony characteristics and Grams technique were used to differentiate the organisms. Biochemical tests were done to confirm the species of the organisms. Sensitivity testing was done on the isolates using the disk diffusion method.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Pathogenic bacteria were recovered from 58.5% of the specimens. The isolates were: S.aureus (45.1%), Coliforms (16.9%), Proteus mirabilis (11.3%), P.aeruginosa (9.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.0%) and Enterobacter spp (2.82%). Most of the organisms were sensitive to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. There was resistance to ampicillin, amoxycillin and chloramphenicol. Staphylococcus aureus was generally sensitive to gentamicin (87.5%), ciprofloxacin (68.7%) and methicillin (75%), but resistant to erythromycin (56.2%) and ampicillin (97%). Most of the gram-negative bacteria isolated (Coliforms, P.aeruginosa, E.coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin and Ceftazidime but resistant to Ampicillin, Amoxycillin and Chloramphenicol. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains formed 25% of this species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was sensitive to gentamicin (87.5%) and ceftazidime (85.7%) but showed resistance to ciprofloxacin (57.2%). Some organisms e.g. S.aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis exhibited multi-drug resistance to the antibiotics tested.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Since a high proportion of samples had positive cultures, infection control is recommended as a strategy to minimise spread of resistant organisms. It is recommended that gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime be used in preference to ampicillin and amoxycillin for treatment of septic wounds. There is need to develop national surveillance of antibiotic- resistant organisms."

One of the practices to reduce their incidence is preoperative skin antisepsis. Two of the most commonly active components used are chlorhexidine gluconate and povidone iodine. Of 3 reviews conducted between 2010 and 2012 comparing antiseptics, 2 were in favor of chlorhexidine; however, the latest was unable to draw conclusions.\n    \n\n\n          Purpose:\n        \n      \n      To verify whether recent evidence supports the hypothesis that chlorhexidine in preoperative antisepsis is more efficient than other antiseptics in reducing SSI rates.\n    \n\n\n          Procedures:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a systematic review from 2000-2014 in all languages.

These data were combined with resource utilisation estimates derived from a panel of clinicians enabling us to perform decision modelling.

In the UK, managing abscesses and other surgical wounds with CMCD instead of gauze is expected to reduce costs by 30% (574 pounds) and 12% (581 pounds) respectively per patient over eight weeks. The lower cost of managing CMCD-treated patients is due to decreased nursing costs associated with a lower frequency of CMCD changes compared to gauze dressing changes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Dressing surgical wounds healing by secondary intention with CMCD instead of gauze is expected to lead to a reduction in healthcare costs in both the US and UK.

The goal of this study was to analyze patterns in telemedicine use among podiatric physicians during the COVID-19 crisis on a national level. Anonymous responses to a survey of practice metrics as well as subjective impressions of telemedicine efficacy were collected from 246 respondents, representing >1% of practicing podiatrists in the United States. Linear regression was performed to identify variables associated with COVID-19 prevalence and variables associated with higher self-reported likelihood of offering telemedicine visits post-COVID-19. Physicians in areas of lower COVID-19 prevalence were found to dispense durable medical equipment more frequently in-office and conduct more post-op telemedicine visits, with fewer visits for infections and trauma. Podiatrists in these regions also rated telemedicine more effective for medical and musculoskeletal pathologies. Additionally, fewer of their practices had modified office hours, and more of them advertised telemedicine services. Physicians more likely to offer telemedicine post-COVID-19 had significantly higher new patient volume and increased acuity of cases, with patient admission to the hospital after telemedicine visits. These physicians ranked the effectiveness of telemedicine more highly for every pathology surveyed. Of note, American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons region and years in clinical practice were not statistically associated with likelihood of offering telemedicine visits post-COVID-19.

In 19 patients (90%), clinical signs of NI appeared within 7 days of discharge. Assuming that all 5,431 patients who were missed for follow-up did not experience any NI, an attack rate of 0.3 per 100 admissions may be estimated for the whole group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We diagnosed 1% of NIs following discharge from a hospital in a cohort of 2,199 patients, of which 1.3% were seen post-surgery and 0.8% following nonsurgical admissions.

Few data, however, are available on the long-term wound complications resulting from this technique. We conducted a retrospective review of patients to identify the extent of wound complications found during a minimum follow-up period of 2 years after laparoendoscopic single-site adjustable gastric banding. The complications evaluated included infection, hernia rates, and port and tubing complications. All the laparoendoscopic single-site adjustable gastric banding cases were performed at University of Illinois Medical Center by a single surgeon.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-five patients underwent single-site laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding from March 2009 to January 2010, and the data were reviewed retrospectively.

We selected a limited set of readily available, cheap and evidence-based interventions from these new guidelines that are not part of standard practice in the Netherlands and formulated an Enhanced PeriOperative Care and Health bundle (EPOCH). Here, we describe the protocol for an open-label, randomised controlled, parallel-group, superiority trial to test the effect of the EPOCH bundle added to (national) standard care in comparison to standard care alone on the incidence of SSI.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      EPOCH consists of intraoperative high fractional inspired oxygen (0.80); goal-directed fluid therapy; active preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative warming; perioperative glucose control and treatment of severe hyperglycaemia (>10 mmoll-1) and standardised surgical site handling. Patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery with an incision larger than 5 cm are eligible for inclusion. Participants are randomised daily, 1:1 according to variable block sizes, and stratified per participating centre to either EPOCH added to standard care or standard care only. The primary endpoint will be SSI incidence according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition within 30 days as part of routine clinical follow-up. Four additional questionnaires will be sent out over the course of 90 days to capture disability and costs. Other secondary endpoints include anastomotic leakage, incidence of incisional hernia, serious adverse events, hospital readmissions, length of stay and cost effectiveness.

This presents a key opportunity in surgical site infection surveillance. Remote follow up methods have been used via telephone, with photographs and questionnaires for post-operative reviews with varying results. This review therefore aims to comprehensively synthesise available evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of all forms of SSI telemedicine monitoring. The protocol has been established as per both PRISMA-P (S1 Table) and the Cochrane handbook for reviews of diagnostic test accuracy. Medline, Embase, CENTRAL and CINAHL will be searched using a complete search strategy developed with librarian input, in addition to google scholar and hand searching. All study designs with patients over 18 and undergone a primarily closed surgical procedure will be eligible. Index tests will include all forms of telemedicine and a subgroup analysis performed for each of these. Comparative tests must include face to face review, and all reference standards will be included again for sub-group analyses. Search results will be screened by two investigators independently with a third providing consensus review on disagreements. Methodological quality will be assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, first validated by two investigators as per the Cochrane handbook. Exploratory analysis will formulate summary receiver operating characteristic curves and forest plots with estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the included studies. Sources of heterogeneity will be identifying and investigated through further analysis. Potential benefits of telemedicine integration in surgical practice will reduce cost and travel time to patients in addition to avoiding wasted clinic appointments, important considerations in a peri-pandemic era. To avoid missed or further complications, there must be confidence in the ability to diagnose infection. This review will systematically determine whether telemedicine is accurate for surgical site infection diagnosis, which methods are well established and if further research is indicated."

            "abstract": "Kidney transplant recipients who develop symptoms consistent with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are bringing unique challenges to health care professionals. Telemedicine has surged dramatically since the pandemic in effort to maintain patient care and reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure to patients, health care workers, and the public. Herein we present reports of 3 kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 who were managed using telemedicine via synchronous video visits integrated with an electronic medical record system, from home to inpatient settings. We demonstrate how telemedicine helped assess, diagnose, triage, and treat patients with COVID-19 while avoiding a visit to an emergency department or outpatient clinic. While there is limited information about the duration of viral shedding for immunosuppressed patients, our findings underscore the importance of using telemedicine in the follow-up care for kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 who have recovered from symptoms but might have persistently positive nucleic acid tests. Our experience emphasizes the opportunities of telemedicine in the management of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 and in the maintenance of uninterrupted follow-up care for such immunosuppressed patients with prolonged viral shedding. Telemedicine may help increase access to care for kidney transplant recipients during and beyond the pandemic as it offers a prompt, safe, and convenient platform in the delivery of care for these patients. Yet, to advance the practice of telemedicine in the field of kidney transplantation, barriers to increasing the widespread implementation of telemedicine should be removed, and research studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of telemedicine in the care of kidney transplant recipients."

Despite a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage in this population, no multicenter study of antibiotic prophylaxis practices and the rate and microbiological characteristics of surgical site infection (SSI) has been performed in France.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      Retrospective, multicenter cohort study.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-two university and community hospitals in France.\n    \n\n\n          Patients:\n        \n      \n      Each center provided data on 25 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for femoral neck fracture during the first quarter of 2005. Demographic, clinical, and follow-up characteristics were recorded, and most patients had a follow-up office visit or were involved in a telephone survey 1 year after surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      These 22 centers provided data on 541 patients, 396 (73%) of whom were followed up 1 year after surgery. Of 504 (93%) patients for whom antibiotic prophylaxis was recorded, 433 (86%) received a cephalosporin. Twenty-two patients had an SSI, for a rate of 5.6% (95% confidence interval, 3.7-8.0). SSI was reported for 15 (6.9%) of patients who had a prosthesis placed and for 7 (3.9%) who underwent osteosynthesis (P=.27). SSI was diagnosed a median of 30 days after surgery (interquartile range, 21-41 days); 7 (32%) of these SSIs were superficial infections, and 15 (68%) were deep or organ-space infections. MRSA caused 7 SSIs (32%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa caused 5 (23%), other staphylococci caused 4 (18%), and other bacteria caused 2 (9%); the etiologic pathogen was unknown in 4 cases (18%). Reoperation was performed for 14 patients with deep or organ-space SSI, including 6 of 7 patients with MRSA SSI. The mortality rate 1 year after surgery was 20% overall but 50% among patients with SSI. In univariate analysis, only the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System risk index score was significantly associated with SSI (P=.006).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      SSI after surgery for femoral neck fracture is severe, and MRSA is the most frequently encountered etiologic pathogen. A large, multicenter prospective trial is necessary to determine whether the use of antibiotic prophylaxis effective against MRSA would decrease the SSI rate in this population."

            "abstract": "The management of sternal wound infections often requires pedicled flaps. In recent years, the emergence of perforator flaps has changed our management of wounds involving tissue loss. For sternal wounds, the superior epigastric artery perforator (SEAP) flap can be used with the propeller procedure with minimal donor site morbidity. In our practice, this flap has replaced the traditional latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major flaps in the treatment of many sternal wounds. We report our experience with 4 patients with large sternal wound infection after cardiothoracic operations. The SEAP flap appears a safe alternative for low-morbidity coverage of sternal infections. Moreover, muscle flaps remain available in case the SEAP flap fails."

Post-operative hospitalizations have become shorter over time, yet limited resources exist for patients to use at their home to communicate surgical wound problems with their medical providers. This study evaluated the attitudes of patients and providers towards using a remote wound monitoring application. Methods: This formative descriptive qualitative study reports the result of analysis of the interview content of five patients and five providers from a colorectal surgery clinic at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, South Carolina. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted in the clinic setting, were recorded, and professionally transcribed. Two of the authors independently reviewed and coded the transcribed interviews to identify themes across all 10 interviews. After independent coding, authors reviewed findings to reconcile and streamline the primary themes representing attitudes of patients and providers toward remote wound monitoring. Results: Five primary codes were found across our interviews: current barriers, infection types, workflow, interest in surgical site infection (SSI) monitoring, application considerations, and requested application features. We subcoded \"symptom clarification\" and \"positive anticipation\" under \"interest in SSI monitoring,\" as well as \"anticipated issues\" and \"application features\" under \"application considerations.\" From these codes, we synthesized findings into three overarching themes: smartphone app for remote wound monitoring has potential to improve patient-provider communication, specific wound evaluation processes are acceptable to patients and providers, and new collaboration with telehealth service is a welcome addition for interdisciplinary team management. Conclusions: A prospective approach to the development of a remote wound monitoring application enables a user-centric development process. Our analysis shows a readiness from both patients and providers to implement remote wound monitoring for identifying potential SSIs and coordinating surgical wound care within the community."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Prophylactic administration of antibiotics preceding cesarean delivery is the most effective measure taken for preventing postpartum infection. While obese women are at greater risk for infection than non-obese women, evidence-based recommendations for modifying dosing in these women are limited.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this study was to determine whether obese women undergoing cesarean delivery similarly reach adequate cefazolin concentrations within tissue and blood when weighing <120kg and dosed 2g versus weighing ≥120kg and dosed 3g.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      We prospectively studied women ≥18 years old with body mass index ≥30kg/m2 who underwent scheduled cesarean delivery with singleton pregnancy from August 2014 through March 2016. Women were dosed with 2g and 3g of cefazolin for body weights <120kg and ≥120kg, respectively. Samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue (following skin incision and before skin closure), myometrial tissue, fetal cord blood, and maternal blood were collected to assess whether cefazolin concentrations were adequate, i.e., at/above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Concentrations, based on inhibition zones for Streptococcus sanguinis, were calculated per gram of solid tissue and milliliter of blood. For all sample types, log-transformed concentrations were compared between dosage groups. Using a range of published MICs (1-8μg/mL or μg/g), odds ratios, describing differential odds of falling below the MIC between dosage groups, were also computed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Women who received 2g (n=65) versus 3g (n=19) of cefazolin did not significantly differ by maternal or gestational age, race/ethnicity, pre-operative hemoglobin, estimated blood loss, fluid administration, duration of surgery, or timing of sample collections relative to cefazolin administration (Ps>0.05). Dosage groups also did not differ in cefazolin concentration (median [interquartile range]) within adipose tissue following skin incision (5.30μg/g [3.00-9.60] vs. 6.35μg/g [3.90-8.40]; P=0.551), adipose tissue before skin closure (4.45μg/g [2.78-7.25] vs. 6.90μg/g [2.60-10.6]; P=0.342), myometrial tissue (13.1μg/g [8.60-19.6] vs. 15.7μg/g [10.8-21.7]; P=0.116), or maternal blood (41.6μg/mL [26.3-57.0] vs. 45.3μg/mL [36.7-68.3]; P=0.143). However, cord blood concentrations differed significantly (19.5μg/mL [13.7-28.5] vs. 27.9μg/mL [15.8-39.4]; P=0.032), and, in 3 of 5 sample types, group concentrations differed at the dosing cut-point of 120kg (Ps<0.02). Within the range of MICs considered, differences in the odds of concentration inadequacy were not detected between dosage groups for any sample type. Across all patients, inadequate concentrations in one or more solid tissue types were observed in 1.19%, 17.9%, 59.5%, and 86.9% of patients, given the MICs of 1μg/g, 2μg/g, 4μg/g and 8μg/g, respectively. In adipose tissues, specifically, and both dosage groups, mean concentrations were significantly lower than the MIC of 8μg/g (Ps<0.03). Concentrations in one or both blood sample types were inadequate for only 8.33% of patients, given the 8-μg/mL MIC.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Adequate cefazolin concentrations were achieved in blood for the majority of our patients. However, concentration adequacy was not achieved in solid tissue for a nearly equally large proportion of patients. Larger scale studies for determining modified protocols for dosing and applying MICs are warranted."

The epidemiologists of the public health network reported 868 acute posttransfusion hepatitis within this seven years period. The number of the cases decreased year by year, and in accordance with the rapid development of virological diagnostics the rate of cases with uncovered aetiology increased gradually. Nevertheless the aetiology of more than half of the reported cases (466 patients, i.e. 53.6%) remained unknown. The results of the examinations were negative in 167 cases (19.2%), and no etiological examinations were carried out in 299 cases (34.4%). Hepatitis A was reported in 17 cases (2%), hepatitis B in 129 cases (14.9%), whilst non-A, non-B hepatitis was diagnosed in 188 cases based on examinations with an experimental NANB antigen and antibody tests or by exclusion of hepatitis A and B infectious (21.7%); from 1991 67 cases (7.7%) were diagnosed by standard tests as hepatitis C, and Epstein-Barr virus infection was reported in 1 case (0.1%).

Honey has been used since ancient times as a remedy in wound care. Evidence from animal studies and some trials has suggested that honey may accelerate wound healing.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The objective of this review was to assess the effects of honey compared with alternative wound dressings and topical treatments on the of healing of acute (e.g. burns, lacerations) and/or chronic (e.g. venous ulcers) wounds.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      For this update of the review we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 15 October 2014); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 9); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to October Week 1 2014); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 13 October 2014); Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 13 October 2014); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 15 October 2014).\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that evaluated honey as a treatment for any sort of acute or chronic wound were sought. There was no restriction in terms of source, date of publication or language. Wound healing was the primary endpoint.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Data from eligible trials were extracted and summarised by one review author, using a data extraction sheet, and independently verified by a second review author. All data have been subsequently checked by two more authors.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 26 eligible trials (total of 3011 participants). Three trials evaluated the effects of honey in minor acute wounds, 11 trials evaluated honey in burns, 10 trials recruited people with different chronic wounds including two in people with venous leg ulcers, two trials in people with diabetic foot ulcers and single trials in infected post-operative wounds, pressure injuries, cutaneous Leishmaniasis and Fournier's gangrene. Two trials recruited a mixed population of people with acute and chronic wounds. The quality of the evidence varied between different comparisons and outcomes. We mainly downgraded the quality of evidence for risk of bias, imprecision and, in a few cases, inconsistency.There is high quality evidence (2 trials, n=992) that honey dressings heal partial thickness burns more quickly than conventional dressings (WMD -4.68 days, 95%CI -5.09 to -4.28) but it is unclear if there is a difference in rates of adverse events (very low quality evidence) or infection (low quality evidence).There is very low quality evidence (4 trials, n=332) that burns treated with honey heal more quickly than those treated with silver sulfadiazine (SSD) (WMD -5.12 days, 95%CI -9.51 to -0.73) and high quality evidence from 6 trials (n=462) that there is no difference in overall risk of healing within 6 weeks for honey compared with SSD (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02) but a reduction in the overall risk of adverse events with honey relative to SSD. There is low quality evidence (1 trial, n=50) that early excision and grafting heals partial and full thickness burns more quickly than honey followed by grafting as necessary (WMD 13.6 days, 95%CI 9.82 to 17.38).There is low quality evidence (2 trials, different comparators, n=140) that honey heals a mixed population of acute and chronic wounds more quickly than SSD or sugar dressings.Honey healed infected post-operative wounds more quickly than antiseptic washes followed by gauze and was associated with fewer adverse events (1 trial, n=50, moderate quality evidence, RR of healing 1.69, 95%CI 1.10 to 2.61); healed pressure ulcers more quickly than saline soaks (1 trial, n= 40, very low quality evidence, RR 1.41, 95%CI 1.05 to 1.90), and healed Fournier's gangrene more quickly than Eusol soaks (1 trial, n=30, very low quality evidence, WMD -8.00 days, 95%CI -6.08 to -9.92 days).The effects of honey relative to comparators are unclear for: venous leg ulcers (2 trials, n= 476, low quality evidence); minor acute wounds (3 trials, n=213, very low quality evidence); diabetic foot ulcers (2 trials, n=93, low quality evidence); Leishmaniasis (1 trial, n=100, low quality evidence); mixed chronic wounds (2 trials, n=150, low quality evidence).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      It is difficult to draw overall conclusions regarding the effects of honey as a topical treatment for wounds due to the heterogeneous nature of the patient populations and comparators studied and the mostly low quality of the evidence. The quality of the evidence was mainly downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision. Honey appears to heal partial thickness burns more quickly than conventional treatment (which included polyurethane film, paraffin gauze, soframycin-impregnated gauze, sterile linen and leaving the burns exposed) and infected post-operative wounds more quickly than antiseptics and gauze. Beyond these comparisons any evidence for differences in the effects of honey and comparators is of low or very low quality and does not form a robust basis for decision making."

In addition, the results obtained are statistically studied based on various factors, such as the year of publication or the search engine. In this way, we obtain a complete vision of the current state of telemedicine in the field of vascular surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After performing this search and applying selection criteria, 29 articles were obtained for subsequent study and discussion, of which 20 were published in the second half of the decade, representing 70% of the results. In the analysis carried out according to the search criteria used, it can be seen that using the word telemedicine we obtained 69% of the articles while with the criteria mHealth and eHealth we only obtained 22% and 9% of the results, respectively. It can be seen that the filter with the most potential content articles was \"vascular surgery AND telemedicine\". In the analysis performed according to the search engine, it was observed that the Google Scholar database contains 93% of the articles found in the massive search and the relevant articles contained therein represent 52% of the total.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      An upward trend has been observed in recent years, with a clear increase in the number of publications and much lower figures in the first years. One aspect to highlight is that 47.8% of the articles analyzed focus only on postoperative treatment, which may be due to the help provided by telemedicine in detecting surgical site infections by sending images and videos, this being one of the most common postoperative complications. The analyzed works show the importance of telemedicine in vascular surgery and identify possible future lines of research. In the analysis carried out on the origin of the selected relevant papers, an important interest of the US in this topic is demonstrated since more than 50% of the research contains authors from this country, it is also observed that there is no research from Spain, so this research would be an initial step to determine the weaknesses of telemedicine in this field of medicine and a good opportunity to open a research gap in this branch."

The purpose of this study was to identify potential financial implications of continued telehealth use in hand and wrist surgery clinical practice.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Two hundred telehealth visits were randomly selected and matched 1:1 based on primary diagnosis code to in-person visits. Medical and billing records were reviewed to compare visit complexities, total visit charges, work relative value units (wRVUs), and approved insurance reimbursement. Postoperative visits and visits with radiographic evaluation were excluded.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Level 4 visits were more common with in-person encounters compared to telehealth (11% vs 2%, respectively), and level 1 and 2 visits were more common with telehealth compared to in-person encounters (14% vs 6%, respectively). Twenty-seven in-person visits (13%) had at least 1 additional procedure code billed. The mean total visit charge was 26% less in telehealth compared to in-person. Based on the primary procedure code alone, the sum of wRVUs was 15.1 points less in the telehealth cohort compared to in-person (per visit average, 1.1 [telehealth] vs 1.2 [in-person]). The 28 additional services provided during in-person visits accounted for an added 20.7 wRVUs. Unpaid claims were more common among telehealth encounters (8% [telehealth] vs 3% [in-person]).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Higher complexity visits and visits with additional procedural codes billed were more common with in-person visits. This led to a lower number of total wRVUs and lower total visit charges among the included telehealth visits compared to the matched in-person controls.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical relevance:\n        \n      \n      It is important to understand and consider the long-term financial impact of telehealth implementation. Practices must develop strategies to incorporate radiographic evaluation into telehealth visits and effectively stratify those patients that may require procedural interventions for in-person visits. Understanding the economic implications of this changing care delivery paradigm, providers can continue to provide telehealth services while protecting the financial sustainability of hand surgery practices."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Many people undergo surgical operations during their life-time, which result in surgical wounds. After an operation the incision is closed using stiches, staples, steri-strips or an adhesive glue. Usually, towards the end of the surgical procedure and before the patient leaves the operating theatre, the surgeon covers the closed surgical wound using gauze and adhesive tape or an adhesive tape containing a pad (a wound dressing) that covers the surgical wound. There is currently no guidance about when the wound can be made wet by post-operative bathing or showering. Early bathing may encourage early mobilisation of the patient, which is good after most types of operation. Avoiding post-operative bathing or showering for two to three days may result in accumulation of sweat and dirt on the body. Conversely, early washing of the surgical wound may have an adverse effect on healing, for example by irritating or macerating the wound, and disturbing the healing environment.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To compare the benefits (such as potential improvements to quality of life) and harms (potentially increased wound-related morbidity) of early post-operative bathing or showering (i.e. within 48 hours after surgery, the period during which epithelialisation of the wound occurs) compared with delayed post-operative bathing or showering (i.e. no bathing or showering for over 48 hours after surgery) in patients with closed surgical wounds.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (30th June 2015); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; EBSCO CINAHL; the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We considered all randomised trials conducted in patients who had undergone any surgical procedure and had surgical closure of their wounds, irrespective of the location of the wound and whether or not the wound was dressed.

We also excluded quasi-randomised trials, cohort studies and case-control studies.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We extracted data on the characteristics of the patients included in the trials, risk of bias in the trials and outcomes from each trial. For binary outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous variables we planned to calculate the mean difference (MD), or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI. For count data outcomes, we planned to calculate the rate ratio (RaR) with 95% CI. We used RevMan 5 software for performing these calculations.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Only one trial was identified for inclusion in this review. This trial was at a high risk of bias. This trial included 857 patients undergoing minor skin excision surgery in the primary care setting. The wounds were sutured after the excision. Patients were randomised to early post-operative bathing (dressing to be removed after 12 hours and normal bathing resumed) (n = 415) or delayed post-operative bathing (dressing to be retained for at least 48 hours before removal and resumption of normal bathing) (n = 442). The only outcome of interest reported in this trial was surgical site infection (SSI). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who developed SSIs between the two groups (857 patients; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.48). The proportions of patients who developed SSIs were 8.5% in the early bathing group and 8.8% in the delayed bathing group.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is currently no conclusive evidence available from randomised trials regarding the benefits or harms of early versus delayed post-operative showering or bathing for the prevention of wound complications, as the confidence intervals around the point estimate are wide, and, therefore, a clinically significant increase or decrease in SSI by early post-operative bathing cannot be ruled out. We recommend running further randomised controlled trials to compare early versus delayed post-operative showering or bathing."

All enrolled patients were followed-up for 30 days post discharge to fully document the incidence of SSIs.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Median age of patients was 35.5 (25 - 50) years, with 52% female. There were 35.8% emergency and 64.2% elective surgeries. The most common operations were exploratory laparotomy (25%), appendectomy (18.3%), excision, and mastectomy (8%). Antibiotics were given in 73.3% of patients, mainly postoperatively (58.3%). The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were cefotaxime (80.7%), metronidazole (63.5%), cefradine (13.6%) and amoxicillin/clavulanate (11.6%). The incidence of SSI was 9%. The most common organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The rate of SSI is a concern, and may be related to inappropriate antibiotic prophylaxis given post operatively. Interventions are in place to decrease SSI rates to acceptable levels in this leading hospital by improving for instance infection prevention practices including the timing of antibiotic prophylaxis. Research is also ongoing among other hospitals in Botswana to reduce SSI rates building on these findings."

The mean difference between the NHSN and the ACS NSQIP was 8.3% (range, 1.6%-18.8%), with the ACS NSQIP rate always higher. The correlation between the observed to expected ratios for the 2 programs was nonsignificant (Pearson product moment correlation, ρ = 0.4465; P = .08).

It is imperative to reconcile SSI monitoring, develop consistent definitions, and establish one reliable method. The current state hinders hospital improvement efforts by adding unnecessary confusion to the already complex arena of perioperative improvement."

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of several infection-control strategies on post-operative wound complications after open infra-inguinal re-vascularization.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A retrospective cohort study was conducted among all patients who underwent an open infra-inguinal re-vascularization procedure before and after 2014. Since 2014, we have implemented strategies to reduce post-operative wound complications, including: (1) Decreasing the use of incisional skin staples, (2) increasing the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) dressings, and (3) implementing an outpatient elective decontamination protocol for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. \"Pre-era\" is defined as the period between January 2012 and December 2013, before the implementation of infection control strategies; \"Post-era\" is between January 2015 and August 2016, after implementation. The primary outcome of interest is 30-day wound complications (infection or dehiscence). Multi-variable logistic regression analysis was used to identify significant predictors of wound-related complications between the two cohorts. Propensity score adjustment controlled for baseline patient characteristics, peri-operative variables, and surgeon experience.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 338 open infra-inguinal procedures were performed: 175 in the pre-era and 163 in the post-era. Chlorhexidine skin preparation was used in the majority (321 [95%]) of cases. Comparing the periods, the post-era is characterized by a significant decrease in the use of groin staples (118 [67%] vs. 51 [31%], p < 0.001), and an increased application of NPWT dressings (6 [4%] vs. 66 [43%], p < 0.001). Thirty-five (37%) outpatient elective cases received the pre-operative decontamination protocol in the post-era. Compared with the pre-era, there was a decrease in the 30-day rate of wound complications (68 [39%] to 42 [26%], p = 0.011), and infection-related re-admissions (31 [17.7%] to 21 [12.9%], p = 0.220). When adjusting for patient characteristics, operative variables, and surgeon experience, post-era had significantly lower wound complications (odds ratio [OR] 0.33, p = 0.002) and re-operations (OR 0.16, p = 0.007). Among outpatient elective cases, the decontamination protocol was also independently associated with these two outcomes (wound complications: OR 0.05, p = 0.006; re-operations: 0.06, p = 0.002). The use of groin staples was an independent predictor of deep groin infections (OR 248, p < 0.001) and re-operations (OR 8.16, p = 0.032).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Wound complications after open infra-inguinal re-vascularization have decreased significantly after the implementation of several infection-control strategies.

Phase B - from 4 March 2016 to 30 November 2016, we approached 862 patients for the pilot RCT; 81.1% were eligible, 59.4% consented and 394 were randomised (simple, n = 133; glue, n = 129; no dressing, n = 132); non-adherence was 3 out of 133, 8 out of 129 and 20 out of 132, respectively. SSI occurred in 51 out of 281 participants. We interviewed 55 participants. All dressing strategies were acceptable to stakeholders, with no indication that adherence was problematic. Adherence aids and patients' understanding of their allocated dressing appeared to be key. The SSI questionnaire response rate overall was 67.2%. Items in the SSI questionnaire fitted a single scale, which had good reliability (test-retest and Cronbach's alpha of > 0.7) and diagnostic accuracy (c-statistic = 0.906). The key cost drivers were hospital appointments, dressings and redressings, use of new medicines and primary care appointments.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      Multiple activities, often in parallel, were challenging to co-ordinate. An amendment took 4 months, restricting recruitment to the pilot RCT. Only 67% of participants completed the SSI questionnaire. We could not implement photography in theatres.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A main RCT of dressing strategies is feasible and would be valuable to the NHS. The SSI questionnaire is sufficiently accurate to be used as the primary outcome. A main trial with three groups (as in the pilot) would be valuable to the NHS, using a primary outcome of SSI at discharge and patient-reported SSI symptoms at 4-8 weeks.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Phase A - Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN06792113; Phase B - Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN49328913.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 23, No. 39.

Although commonly encountered in practice, its ideal treatment is controversial. One of the most validated treatments is video-assisted surgery. In this context, very similar endoscopic techniques have been published under different names. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the differences among these proposed techniques and their outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed during all stages of this systematic review. A systematic search of the English literature was performed on multiple databases from 1 January 2014 to 3 April 2022. The primary outcome measure was the IDEAL framework stage of innovation. The key secondary outcome measures were the adherence to the IDEAL reporting guidelines, the Blencowe framework and the core outcome set (COS) for studies evaluating the introduction and evaluation of novel surgical techniques, the qualitative assessment using appropriate tools, the procedural variations and outcomes of each technique.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 38 articles were included reporting a very similar technique under eight different acronyms. The number of patients varied from 9 to 250. Mean follow-up ranged from 1 to 60 months. There was only one published study of IDEAL 3. The majority (58%) were IDEAL 2a studies. Reporting of domains in the IDEAL reporting guidelines and Blencowe framework was poor, with most studies not reporting the component steps of procedures or efforts to standardize them. Half of COS domains were markedly underreported. The quality of the evidence was categorized as having a risk of bias from moderate to critical level in all nine comparative non-randomized series. Postoperative complications occurred in 0%-6% of cases, including surgical site infection, poor or failed wound healing bleeding, granuloma, haematoma, and pain requiring intervention. The recurrence rate varied from 0% to 22%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The study demonstrates that reporting on technical aspects of interventions for PD is poor, thus warranting a better-quality control of surgical techniques. It is advisable to group all endoscopic procedures under the umbrella term of 'endoscopic sinusectomy', thus embracing the two main principles of this technique, that is, video assistance and PD ablation."

            "abstract": "A 56-year-old man was on the transplant list with end-stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C when a donor liver became available at a location 545 km away. The procurement team, consisting of a senior and junior fellow, went on the retrieval, while the staff surgeon remained in the hospital with the recipient. At the time of organ procurement, a suspicious lesion was identified in the left lateral lobe. The transplant fellows took intraoperative pictures of the lesion with a smart phone and sent them to the staff surgeon for advice. A teleconsultation, facilitated by images sent from the smart phone, took place over the next 22 min. The decision was made to proceed with the transplant, as it was felt that the lesion could be resected from the liver allograft. Had the fellows not been able to interact with the staff surgeon in real-time during the surgery, there is a high likelihood that the organ would have been rejected by the staff surgeon due to the unexpected finding. The patient's postoperative course was relatively uneventful with no evidence of infection. The patient was discharged from hospital and continues to do well. We expect that the role of smart phones in remote consultation will continue to expand in future."

            "abstract": "With the increasing global presence of and reliance on smartphones, featuring high-resolution digital photography and wireless, high-speed Internet, patients with wounds and point-of-care wound professionals are increasingly engaged in remote wound management and surveillance. Twenty years ago, home wound care professionals, advised by remote experts using telemedicine, were achieving sterling chronic wound outcomes. Mobile technology has sharply reduced transportation costs compared with clinic visits. Registered nurses using smartphones to access a web-based surgical infection site (SIS) surveillance algorithm based on validated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, extended reliable, valid SIS surveillance into the first month of home care as recommended in the guidelines. This improved timely SIS identification and management while generating a registry that motivated patients and caregivers. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic accelerated needs for evidence-based care delivered by telemedicine, empowering wound care professionals to deliver quality care while limiting risks associated with patient contact. This installment of Evidence Corner reviews 2 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that used telehealth in varying ways to improve health care delivery and outcomes. One reported use of a telehealth application is to improve patient knowledge and outcomes of diabetic foot care. The second compared clinical and economic outcomes for patients with complex wounds whose local clinicians delivered home care guided by remote experts using telemedicine with those of similar patients managed without expert advice in the home or patients who attended wound clinics."

            "abstract": "COVID-19 has changed the nature of medical consultations, emphasizing virtual patient counselling, with relevance for patients with diabetes insipidus (DI) or hyponatraemia. The main complication of desmopressin treatment in DI is dilutional hyponatraemia. Since plasma sodium monitoring is not always possible in times of COVID-19, we recommend to delay the desmopressin dose once a week until aquaresis occurs allowing excess retained water to be excreted. Patients should measure their body weight daily. Patients with DI admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 have a high risk for mortality due to volume depletion. Specialists must supervise fluid replacement and dosing of desmopressin. Patients after pituitary surgery should drink to thirst and measure their body weight daily to early recognize the development of postoperative SIAD. They should know hyponatraemia symptoms. Hyponatraemia in COVID-19 is common with a prevalence of 20-30% and is mostly due to SIAD or hypovolaemia. It mirrors disease severity and is an early predictor of mortality. Hypernatraemia may also develop in COVID-19 patients, with a prevalence of 3-5%, especially in ICU, and derives from different multifactorial reasons, for example, due to insensible water losses from pyrexia, increased respiration rate and use of diuretics. Hypernatraemic dehydration may contribute to the high risk of acute kidney injury in COVID-19. IV fluid replacement should be administered with caution in severe cases of COVID-19 because of the risk of pulmonary oedema."

The remote physician then read the clinical data and viewed the digital images on a 38 cm colour display monitor, at a resolution of 800x600 pixels, in 16-bit colour, using standard software. Three elderly inpatients with pressure sores or leg ulcers had both bedside and remote examinations, by different physicians. The diagnosis and therapeutic recommendations proposed after each of the two examinations were compared qualitatively. There was reasonable agreement between the two physicians in the assessment of wound size, anatomical classification, wound bed and status of infection. However, the lack of palpation represented a major limitation to remote wound assessment, despite the use of probes to delineate the depth of any opening in the wound bed."

The quality of patient care with telemedicine in orthopedic oncology has not been assessed. Between March and June 2020, a telephone survey of 64 patients was conducted in an academic orthopedic oncology practice. Patient satisfaction was assessed with a Likert scale metric, open-ended feedback, and direct comparisons between telemedicine and in-office visits. Billing and collection financial data of the telemedicine cohort and of a separate cohort of in-office visits during the same time period were compared. The clinical competency of telemedicine visits was measured by delayed or missed diagnoses and surgical site infections that may be attributable to lack of an in-person physical examination. Overall, patients were largely satisfied with their telemedicine experience. More than 90% of patients described telemedicine as equal to or better than in-office visits regarding convenience, time, privacy, and overall quality. Patients reported that better assessment of their physical condition may be indicated, particularly in early postoperative and early sarcoma surveillance visits. Two of 64 patients had adverse events (both local recurrences) potentially attributable to lack of an in-person physical examination. Institutional financial reimbursement of telemedicine visits was comparable to that of in-office visits. These findings have supported continued use of telemedicine in our practice, particularly for patients traveling significant distance and those returning for sarcoma surveillance. However, the limitations of lack of an in-person physical examination should be considered on a case-by-case basis. [Orthopedics. 2021;44(5):274-279.]."

            "abstract": "Background: Surgical research is potentially invasive, high-risk, and costly. Research that advances medical dogma must justify both its ends and its means. Although ethical questions do not always have simple answers, it is critically important for the clinician, researcher, and patient to approach these dilemmas and surgical research in a thoughtful, conscientious manner. Methods: We present four ethical issues in surgical research and discuss the opposing viewpoints. These topics were presented and discussed at the 39th Annual Meeting of the Surgical Infection Society as pro-con debates. The presenters of each opinion developed a succinct summary of their respective reviews for this publication. Results: The key subjects for these pro-con debates were: (1) Should patients be enrolled for time-sensitive surgical infection research using an opt-out or an opt-in strategy? (2) Should patients who are being enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing surgery with a non-operative intervention pay the costs of their treatment arm? (3) Should the scientific community embrace open access journals as the future of scientific publishing? (4) Should the majority of funding go to clinical or basic science research? Important points were illustrated in each of the pro-con presentations and illustrated the difficulties that are facing the performance and payment of infection research in the future. Conclusions: Surgical research is ethically complex, with conflicting demands between individual patients, society, and healthcare economics. At present, there are no clear answers to these and the many other ethical issues facing research in the future. Answers will only come from continued robust dialogue among all stakeholders in surgical research."

Mean (SD) operative time was significantly longer in the minimally invasive treatment group (42.9 [9.8] minutes) vs the conventional treatment group (26.5 [8.7] minutes), P < .001. Although the overall complication rate was similar in both groups, there were fewer infections (1 [1.3%] vs 5 [7.2%]; P = .10) recorded in the minimally invasive treatment group. Similarly, patients enrolled in the minimally invasive treatment group expressed significantly less pain and higher satisfaction.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      In the new era of minimally invasive treatment surgery, pilonidal sinus could become a disease treated with an endoscopic approach. Although additional studies are needed to provide a definitive conclusion, our results encourage considering the adoption of this treatment as the most effective way to treat pilonidal sinus.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01963273."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      A wide range of prophylactic antibiotic regimens are used for patients undergoing open-heart cardiac surgery. This reflects clinical equipoise in choice and duration of antibiotic agents. Although individual-level randomized control trials (RCT) are considered the gold standard when evaluating the efficacy of an intervention, this approach is highly resource intensive and a cluster RCT can be more appropriate for testing clinical effectiveness in a real-world setting.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      We are conducting a factorial cluster-randomized crossover pilot trial in cardiac surgery patients to evaluate the feasibility of this design for a definite trial to evaluate the optimal duration and choice of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Specifically, we will evaluate: (a) the non-inferiority of a single preoperative dose compared to prolonged prophylaxis and (b) the potential superiority of adding vancomycin to routine cefazolin in terms of preventing deep and organ/space sternal surgical site infections (s-SSIs). There are four strategies: (i) short-term cefazolin, (ii) long-term cefazolin, (iii) short-term cefazolin + vancomycin, and (iv) long-term cefazolin + vancomycin. These strategies are delivered in a different order in each health-care center participating in the trial. The centers are randomized to an order, and the current strategy becomes the standard operating procedure in that center during the study. The three feasibility outcomes include: (1) the proportion of patients receiving preoperative, intra-operative, and postoperative antibiotics according to the study protocol, (2) the proportion of completed follow-up assessments, and (3) a full and final assessment of the incidence of s-SSIs by the outcome adjudication committee.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      We believe that a cluster-randomized factorial crossover trial is an effective and feasible design for these research questions, allowing an evaluation of the clinical effectiveness in a real-world setting.

The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of BMI on implant survival and the rate of complications after shoulder arthroplasty.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using an institutional total joint registry, 4,567 consecutive shoulder arthroplasty cases from 1970 to 2013 were studied. The mean BMI was 29.7 kg/m (range, 14 to 66 kg/m), with 1,622 patients (36%) with a BMI of 30 to 40 kg/m and 297 patients (7%) with a BMI of >40 kg/m. There were 2,493 female patients (55%). BMI was dichotomized after examination of the smoothing spline curve. The associations of factors and complications were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Increasing BMI was associated with an increased risk of a revision surgical procedure, reoperation, revision for mechanical failure, and superficial infection, and it was negatively associated with risk of a periprosthetic fracture. The risk of a revision surgical procedure increased in a linear fashion with increasing BMI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05, or a 5% increased risk per 1 unit of BMI; p = 0.03). Increased BMI was also associated with an increased risk of revision for mechanical failure (HR, 1.05; p = 0.004). In a multivariate model, the association of BMI and risk of a revision for any reason, revision for mechanical failure, and reoperation maintained significance (p ≤ 0.02). The most marked association between increasing BMI and any complication in shoulder arthroplasty was its association with superficial wound infection (HR, 1.09; p = 0.03).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Increasing BMI is strongly associated with increased rates of revision surgical procedures and postoperative complications after shoulder arthroplasty.

However, most of the existing SSI risk prediction models are built on static risk factors such as comorbidities and operative factors. In this paper, we investigate the use of the dynamic wound data for SSI risk prediction. There have been emerging mobile health (mHealth) tools that can closely monitor the patients and generate continuous measurements of many wound-related variables and other evolving clinical variables. Since existing prediction models of SSI have quite limited capacity to utilize the evolving clinical data, we develop the corresponding solution to equip these mHealth tools with decision-making capabilities for SSI prediction with a seamless assembly of several machine learning models to tackle the analytic challenges arising from the spatial-temporal data. The basic idea is to exploit the low-rank property of the spatial-temporal data via the bilinear formulation, and further enhance it with automatic missing data imputation by the matrix completion technique. We derive efficient optimization algorithms to implement these models and demonstrate the superior performances of our new predictive model on a real-world dataset of SSI, compared to a range of state-of-the-art methods."

Mean defect area-eTEP is 71 cm2 with no statistical difference, compared to IPOM-76 cm2. Operative time in eTEP is significantly longer with mean time of 186 min and 90 min in IPOM patients. Mean length of stay did not differ between the groups, with 2.9 days after eTEP and 3.4 after IPOM. Median pain score from the intraoperative (the day of surgery) to the seventh postoperative day is lower in the eTEP group. No surgical site infections and/or mesh infections were present. There was one readmission in the IPOM group with ASBO, and it was managed conservatively.

            "abstract": "Prevention of deep periprosthetic infection requires appreciation of the contributing factors to this phenomenon. The concept of an interdependent relationship between the bacteria, wound and host is most useful when considering the prevention of infections. Establishment of infection depends on the number and virulence of the bacteria, the host's ability to eliminate those bacteria and the status of the wound. Multiple variables contribute to the deposition and proliferation of bacteria into the wound environment which enhance the infectious process, such as the presence of a prosthetic implant or medical conditions and medications which impair the patient's defense. Prevention must address optimization of the wound environment, minimizing the number of bacteria into the wound and augmenting the host defenses. Administration of prophylactic antimicrobials prior to skin incision reduces the incidence of wound infections. The optimal antimicrobial agent should have excellent in vitro activity against staphylococci and streptococci, a long serum half-life, good tissue penetration, be non-toxic and inexpensive."

There is an urgent need for chronic infection models to aid in the investigation of wound pathogenesis and the development of new therapies against this pathogen. Here, we describe a protocol that uses delayed inoculation 24 hours after full-thickness excisional wounding. The infection of the provisional wound matrix present at this time forestalls either rapid clearance or dissemination of infection and instead establishes chronic infection lasting 7-10 days without the need for implantation of foreign materials or immune suppression. This protocol mimics a typical temporal course of post-operative infection in humans. The use of a luminescent P. aeruginosa strain (PAO1:lux) allows for quantitative daily assessment of bacterial burden for P. aeruginosa wound infections. This novel model may be a useful tool in the investigation of bacterial pathogenesis and the development of new therapies for chronic P. aeruginosa wound infections."

The cohort was then reviewed for unplanned readmissions and unplanned reoperations within 30 days of POP surgery. Patient and procedural factors associated with readmission or reoperation were compared using χ analyses and Student t test. Multivariable logistic regression determined independent risk factors for both readmission and reoperation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 23,419 patients underwent surgery for POP. Of these, there were 435 (1.9%) readmissions and 341 (1.5%) reoperations within 30 days. Median numbers of days from index procedure to readmission or reoperation were 9 and 8 days, respectively. Those who were readmitted had higher American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) scores, longer operative times, and longer lengths of stay than those who were not readmitted (all P < 0.001). Patients who underwent unplanned reoperation also had higher ASA scores, longer operative times, and longer lengths of stay than those who did not undergo reoperation (all P < 0.01). The most common reasons for readmission were surgical site infection (SSI) (19.3%) and non-SSI (15.9%). The most common reason for reoperation was urologic (27.6%) such as cystoscopy or stent placement.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Readmission and reoperation rates are relatively low for patients undergoing surgery for POP. Infection, both SSI and non-SSI, accounted for 35.2% of readmissions. Identification of ASA score of 3 or higher, longer total operating time, and increased length of stay is associated with unplanned readmission and reoperation."

El análisis de componentes principales identificó compuestos de elementos de paquete correlacionados. El análisis de coincidencia identificó combinaciones de elementos del haz o compuestos de componentes principales asociados con la ausencia de infección del sitio quirúrgico.RESULTADOS:Entre 2722 pacientes, 192 (7,1%) desarrollaron una infección del sitio quirúrgico. Las infecciones fueron menos probables cuando se administraron antibióticos orales (OR 0,63 (IC 95% 0,41-0,97)), protectores de heridas (OR 0,55 (IC 95% 0,37-0,81)) y vendajes oclusivos (OR 0.71 (IC 95% 0,51-1,00]) fueron usados.

            "abstract": "The risk of surgical site infection in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been reduced with the use of prophylactic antibiotics. First or second generation cephalosporins are still recommended as the primary prophylactic choice, but with the rise in the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, evidence has emerged in favor of using dual antibiotics including vancomycin. However, it is unclear whether these combinations of antibiotic regimens further reduce postoperative infection rates. As a result, the objective of this review is to summarize the current literature concerning the use of dual prophylactic antibiotics in TKA. The most common dual prophylactic antibiotic combination is cefazolin (C) and vancomycin (V). In general, when comparing the effectiveness of single versus dual antibiotics, conflicting results have been reported. Three studies demonstrated no substantial decrease in overall postoperative infection rates with the use of dual antibiotics when compared with cefazolin alone. One found a significant decrease only in MRSA infection rates when using cefazolin and vancomycin (CV) (0.8% C alone vs. 0.08% CV, p < 0.05). Another investigation evaluated revision TKA patients who had combined cefazolin and vancomycin prophylaxis and showed a significant decline in both overall infection (7.89% [C] vs. 3.13% [CV]) and MRSA infection rates (4.21% [C] vs. 0.89% [CV]; p < 0.05). Concerning the safety profile of dual antibiotics, particular precautions must be adopted with the use of vancomycin because of the risk of acute kidney injury. Instead of vancomycin, an alternate less nephrotoxic antibiotic option might be teicoplanin. Unfortunately, this latter agent is only available outside of the United States. In conclusion, the value of dual antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of periprosthetic knee infections remains unclear primarily because all comparative studies performed between dual and single antibiotics have been of low evidence with retrospective designs. Larger multicenter randomized controlled trials are warranted."

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought about unprecedented challenges in how we take care of our patients. At Vanderbilt University Medical Center, we have gone to great lengths to implement expeditiously a telemedicine platform for safely and securely evaluating our patients during the pandemic. Since implementing live videoconference appointments in late March, 840 patients received ophthalmic care during a 12-week period among all subspecialties at the Vanderbilt Eye Institute. Of these, the majority (79.6%) were either return or postoperative visits. Live telehealth visits were more amenable to certain ophthalmic subspecialties, with paediatrics, neuro-ophthalmology and oculoplastics encounters making up 80.5% of all telemedicine visits.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the worldwide incidence of SSI and identify associated factors in adult general surgical patients.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review was undertaken using MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), EMBASE (Elsevier) and the Cochrane Library to identify cross-sectional, cohort and observational studies reporting SSI incidence or prevalence. Studies of less than 50 participants were excluded. Data extraction and quality appraisal were undertaken independently by two review authors. The primary outcome was cumulative incidence of SSI occurring up to 30 days postoperative. The secondary outcome was the severity/depth of SSI. The I2 statistic was used to explore heterogeneity. Random effects models were used in the presence of substantial heterogeneity. Subgroup, meta-regression sensitivity analyses were used to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed using Hunter's plots and Egger's regression test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 2091 publications retrieved, 62 studies were included. Of these, 57 were included in the meta-analysis across six anatomical locations with 488,594 patients. The pooled 30-day cumulative incidence of SSI was 11% (95% CI 10%-13%). No prevalence data were identified. SSI rates varied across anatomical location, surgical approach, and priority (i.e., planned, emergency). Multivariable meta-regression showed SSI is significantly associated with duration of surgery (estimate 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, P = .014).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      and Relevance: 11 out of 100 general surgical patients are likely to develop an infection 30 days after surgery. Given the imperative to reduce the burden of harm caused by SSI, high-quality studies are warranted to better understand the patient and related risk factors associated with SSI."

The best therapeutic measure has to be evaluated individually by a differentiated diagnostic procedure. The health condition of the patient, type and localization of the infection, bacteriology and resistance of the microbes as well as the biomechanical condition of the artificial hip joint and the trophic quality of bone and soft tissue play an important role. The different therapeutic concepts we can dispose of should take these factors into account, so that a successful healing may be expected in 80 to 90% of the cases."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Implants are often used to improve the cosmetic appearance of horses after enucleation of the eye. When surgical site infection (SSI) occurs, the implant will almost always be lost. The aim of this study is to collect data on the risk factors for SSIs and report long-term follow-up (cosmetic results and return to work) after transpalpebral enucleations. In this retrospective study, records of horses undergoing transpalpebral enucleation were reviewed (2007-2014) and telephone interviews were used to obtain long term follow-up. The potential risk factors for SSIs (indication for enucleation, use of an implant, standing procedures, duration of surgery, opening of the conjunctival sac and prolonged use of antimicrobials) were analysed for their association with the outcome measure 'SSI' vs 'no SSI' by multivariable binary logistic regression testing. Indications for enucleation were grouped as follows: Group 1 (clean) included equine recurrent uveitis, too small or too large globes, and intraocular tumours, Group 2 (non-clean) included corneal perforation/rupture and infected ulcers and Group 3 (tumour) included extraocular tumours.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One hundred and seven cases of enucleation were evaluated. An implant was used in 49 horses. The overall number of SSIs was 8 (7.5%). Multivariable logistic regression testing showed implants (OR 7.5, P = 0.04) and standing procedures (OR 12.1; P = 0.03) were significantly associated with the percentage of SSIs and increased the risk of SSI. The eyes of horses in Groups 2 and 3 trended towards a larger risk for developing SSIs (OR 4.9; P = 0.09 and OR 5.9; P = 0.1, respectively). Prolonged use of antimicrobials, long surgery times and the opening of the conjunctival sac during dissection did not show significant associations with SSI risk.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The risk of SSI after enucleation is low in clean eyes and when no implant is used. Placing an implant or performing a standing enucleation significantly increases the risk of SSIs. Although implants can be used for eyes that fall into Groups 2 and 3, 17% of the horses in these two groups developed an SSI leading to loss of the implant."

Although the World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention do not recommend additional AMP after closure, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists and the Musculoskeletal Infection Society permit the use of postoperative AMP, but recommend discontinuation within 24 h. Similarly, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and the Japan Society for Surgical Infection also permit AMP within 24-48 h after various orthopaedic procedures. In these guidelines, recommendations regarding AMP duration were weak due to a relative lack of evidence, and currently, there is no high-quality evidence comparing AMP use within 24 h versus 24-48 h regarding orthopaedic procedures. Urinary tract infection (UTI) and respiratory tract infection (RTI) are also important health care-associated infections (HAIs) faced after surgery. Although AMP duration may affect these HAIs, its effects have not been well evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We have organized a multicenter, prospective, cluster pseudo-randomized controlled trial to examine the non-inferiority of shorter AMP duration (within 24 h) against longer duration (24-48 h) in preventing postoperative HAIs. Participating facilities will be divided into two groups. In Group 24, AMP will be discontinued within 24 h after surgery. In Group 48, AMP will be discontinued within 24-48 h after surgery. The group allocation will be switched every 2 months until the targeted recruitment (500 participants per group) is met. The primary outcome will be the cumulative incidence of all HAIs (SSI, UTI, RTI, and other infectious diseases), which require antibiotic therapies within 30 days after surgery. In addition to mortality and cardiovascular events, prolonged hospitalization (> 30 days) and the rate of antibiotic resistance rate of SSI pathogens will also be evaluated.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Obesity is a significant risk factor for surgical site infections (SSIs), for poorly understood reasons. SSIs are a major cause of morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and increased health care cost. Drug disposition in general is frequently altered in the obese. Preoperative antibiotic administration, achieving adequate tissue concentrations at the time of incision, is an essential strategy to prevent SSIs. Nonetheless, there is little information regarding antibiotic concentrations in obese surgical patients. This investigation tested the hypothesis that the prophylactic antibiotic cefoxitin may have delayed and/or diminished tissue penetration in the obese.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Plasma and tissue concentrations of cefoxitin were determined in obese patients undergoing abdominal and pelvic surgery (body mass index 43 ± 10 kg/m(2), n = 14, 2 g cefoxitin) and in normal-weight patients and healthy volunteers (body mass index 20 ± 2 kg/m(2), n = 13, 1 g cefoxitin).

Dose-normalized concentrations were higher, although AUCs were not significantly different. Measured and dose-normalized subcutaneous cefoxitin concentrations and AUCs in the obese patients were significantly lower than in the normal-weight subjects. There was an inverse relationship between cefoxitin tissue penetration (AUC(tissue)/AUC(plasma) ratio) and body mass index. Tissue penetration was substantially lower in the obese patients (0.08 ± 0.07 vs 0.37 ± 0.26, P < 0.05). Adipose tissue cefoxitin concentrations in obese patients were only 7.8 ± 7.3 and 2.7 ± 1.4 μg/g, respectively, at incision and closure, below the minimum inhibitory concentration of 8 and 16 μg/mL, respectively, for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Obese surgical patients have impaired tissue penetration of the prophylactic antibiotic cefoxitin, and inadequate tissue concentrations despite increased clinical dose (2 g).

A prior retrospective cohort of our burn center's admissions revealed worse outcomes among diabetic patients, that is, increased infection rates, grafting and graft complications, and increased length of hospital stay. Therefore, a prospective study has been designed to carefully assess wound repair and recovery of diabetic and nondiabetic burn patients. Our long-term aim is to determine the characteristics of the wound milieu along with global responses to injury that may predict poor outcome among diabetic patients. This is an initial phase of a larger observational study of in-hospital diabetic (types 1 and 2) and nondiabetic patients, prospectively matched for age (18-70 and >70 years) and burn size (<5, 5-15, and 16-25%). Time (days) to complete index wound closure, documented through serial photography, is the main outcome measure. Secondary measures compare delays in presentation, prevalence of infections, graft rates, wound and graft complications, adverse events, and length of hospital stay. Detailed history, physical, and baseline hemoglobin A1C are elicited from all subjects who are assessed daily over the initial 72 hours poststudy entry, then weekly until complete index wound closure, and finally monthly through 3 months. Forty subjects are presented herein, 24 diabetic and 16 nondiabetic patients. Time to index wound closure was significantly prolonged in diabetic patients, despite increased grafting. These findings suggest that excision and grafting in diabetic patients may not alone be sufficient to ensure rapid closure, as graft complications may contribute to protracted closure. Evaluating graft need may be more complex among diabetic patients, suggesting the need for alternative management strategies. The current prospective study confirms our previous retrospective analysis, notably manifested by significant delays in index wound closure. Our efforts continue in identifying the most important predictors of outcome, especially modifiable factors that would create a basis of intervention to improve care."

Forty-two patients (6.9%) experienced 49 postoperative infections, with no significant difference between treatment groups. The most common infections unrelated to neurosurgery were urinary tract infections (17 cases) and pneumonia (seven cases). Fifteen neurosurgical infections occurred, comprising 11 wound infections, two shunt infections and two cerebral abscesses. Neurosurgical infection rates were similar in the cefotaxime group (2.5%) and the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group (2.3%).

It is important to understand how therapists are currently affected and how things have changed since the onset of the pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Follow-up on a previous survey and investigate the current status of hand therapy practice 10 months into the pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      Web-based survey.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A 38-item survey was electronically delivered to American Society of Hand Therapists members between December 9, 2020 and January 6, 2021. Stress, safety measures, changes in practice patterns and telehealth were focus areas in the survey. Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient was used to analyze nonparametric correlations, Chi-Square analysis examined relationships between categorical values and unpaired t-tests were utilized for the comparison of means.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 378 respondents, 85% reported higher stress levels compared to pre-pandemic times. Younger therapists expressed more stress over childcare concerns (rs = 0.38;P = .000) and job security (rs = 0.21; P = .000), while older therapists expressed more stress over eldercare concerns (rs= -.13;P = .018). Descriptively, hours spent on direct clinical care were near prepandemic levels. Telehealth is currently used by 29% of respondents and did not correlate to age or years of practice. Postoperative cases (t(423) = 4.18;P = .0001) and people age 50-64-years (t(423) = 3.01;P = .002) were most frequently seen for in person visits. Nontraumatic, nonoperative cases (t(423) = 4.52;P = .0001) as well as those 65 years and older (t(423) = 3.71; P = .0002) were more likely to be seen via telehealth.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Hand therapists are adapting as reflected by the return to near normal work hours and less utilization of telehealth. Respondents still report higher levels of stress compared to prior to the pandemic, and this stress appears to be multifactorial in nature. Weariness with the precautionary measures such as mask wearing, social distancing and sanitizing was expressed through open-ended responses."

            "abstract": "The reconstruction of complex defects of the chest wall after infection of the sternotomy wound presents a great challenge. Various options have been described for these reconstructions using muscle and omental flaps to fill the space and cover the defect. A case of reconstruction of a large defect of the chest cage and abdominal wall in a 62-year-old patient is presented. After surgery for revascularization of the myocardium, the patient developed mediastinitis, osteomyelitis, and necrosis of the sternum. The pectoralis major muscle was utilized for the reconstruction, but total loss of the flap occurred. After débridement, an omental flap obtained by laparoscopy was employed based on the left gastroepiploic artery. The omentum was transposed without complications through the abdominal wall defect. An overlay skin graft with the omentum as receptor bed completed the closure. There are advantages in using minimally invasive videolaparoscopy compared with laparotomy in obtaining the omentum, with the same result regarding reconstruction of the defect."

            "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The \"Guideline for Prevention of Surgical Site Infection, 1999\" presents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s recommendations for the prevention of surgical site infections (SSIs), formerly called surgical wound infections. This two-part guideline updates and replaces previous guidelines.1,2 Part I, \"Surgical Site Infection: An Overview,\" describes the epidemiology, definitions, microbiology, pathogenesis, and surveillance of SSIs. Included is a detailed discussion of the pre-, intra-, and postoperative issues relevant to SSI genesis. Part II, \"Recommendations for Prevention of Surgical Site Infection,\" represents the consensus of the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) regarding strategies for the prevention of SSIs.3 Whenever possible, the recommendations in Part II are based on data from well-designed scientific studies. However, there are a limited number of studies that clearly validate risk factors and prevention measures for SSI. By necessity, available studies have often been conducted in narrowly defined patient populations or for specific kinds of operations, making generalization of their findings to all specialties and types of operations potentially problematic. This is especially true regarding the implementation of SSI prevention measures. Finally, some of the infection control practices routinely used by surgical teams cannot be rigorously studied for ethical or logistical reasons (e.g., wearing vs not wearing gloves). Thus, some of the recommendations in Part II are based on a strong theoretical rationale and suggestive evidence in the absence of confirmatory scientific knowledge.It has been estimated that approximately 75% of all operations in the United States will be performed in \"ambulatory,\" \"same-day,\" or \"outpatient\" operating rooms by the turn of the century.4 In recommending various SSI prevention methods, this document makes no distinction between surgical care delivered in such settings and that provided in conventional inpatient operating rooms. This document is primarily intended for use by surgeons, operating room nurses, postoperative inpatient and clinic nurses, infection control professionals, anesthesiologists, healthcare epidemiologists, and other personnel directly responsible for the prevention of nosocomial infections. This document does not: Specifically address issues unique to burns, trauma, transplant procedures, or transmission of bloodborne pathogens from healthcare worker to patient, nor does it specifically address details of SSI prevention in pediatric surgical practice. It has been recently shown in a multicenter study of pediatric surgical patients that characteristics related to the operations are more important than those related to the physiologic status of the patients.5 In general, all SSI prevention measures effective in adult surgical care are indicated in pediatric surgical care. Specifically address procedures performed outside of the operating room (e.g., endoscopic procedures), nor does it provide guidance for infection prevention for invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterization or interventional radiology. Nonetheless, it is likely that many SSI prevention strategies also could be applied or adapted to reduce infectious complications associated with these procedures. Specifically recommend SSI prevention methods unique to minimally invasive operations (i.e., laparoscopic surgery). Available SSI surveillance data indicate that laparoscopic operations generally have a lower or comparable SSI risk when contrasted to open operations.6-11 SSI prevention measures applicable in open operations (e.g., open cholecystectomy) are indicated for their laparoscopic counterparts (e.g., laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Recommend specific antiseptic agents for patient preoperative skin preparations or for healthcare worker hand/forearm antisepsis.

The primary outcome was the incidence of SSI within 30 days after colorectal surgery. The secondary outcomes were mortality within 30 days postoperatively, length of ICU stays and postoperative hospital stays, and cost of hospitalization. Patients were divided into the SSI group and non-SSI group based on the occurrence of SSI. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to analyze risk factors of SSI after colorectal surgery, and subgroup analysis was conducted for open and laparoscopic surgery. Results: The incidence of SSI after colorectal surgery was 5.6% (119/2122), including 47 cases (47/119, 39.5%) with superficial incisional infections, 24 cases (24/119, 20.2%) with deep incisional infections, and 48 cases (48/119, 40.3%) with organ/space infections. The occurrence of SSI significantly increased mortality [2.5% (3/119) vs. 0.1%(3/2003), χ2=22.400, P=0.003], the length of ICU stay [0 (1) day vs. 0(0) day, U=131 339, P<0.001], postoperative hospital stay [18.5 (12.8) days vs. 9.0 (6.0) days, U=167 902, P<0.001], and medical expenses [75 000 (49 000) yuan vs. 60 000 (31 000) yuan, U=126 189, P<0.001] (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that hypertension (OR=1.782, 95%CI: 1.173-2.709, P=0.007), preoperative albumin level (OR=1.680, 95%CI: 1.089-2.592, P=0.019), a contaminated or infected incision (OR= 1.993, 95%CI: 1.076-3.689, P=0.028), emergency surgery (OR=2.067, 95%CI: 1.076-3.972, P=0.029), open surgery (OR=2.132, 95%CI: 1.396-3.255, P<0.001), and surgical duration (OR=1.804, 95%CI: 1.188-2.740, P=0.006) were risk factors for SSI, while preoperative skin preparation (OR=0.478, 95%CI: 0.310-0.737, P=0.001) was a protective factor for SSI. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients undergoing open or laparoscopic surgery. The incidence of SSI in the open surgery group was 10.2%, which was significantly higher than that in the laparoscopic or robotic group (3.5%, χ2=39.816, P<0.001). Subgroup analysis identified that a contaminated or infected incision (OR=2.168, 95%CI: 1.042-4.510, P=0.038) and surgical duration (OR=2.072, 95%CI: 1.171-3.664, P=0.012) were risk factors for SSI after open surgery, while mechanical bowel preparation (OR=0.428, 95%CI: 0.227-0.807, P=0.009) and preoperative skin preparation (OR=0.356, 95%CI: 0.199-0.634, P<0.001) were protective factors for SSI after open surgery. In laparoscopic surgery, diabetes mellitus (OR= 2.292, 95%CI: 1.138-4.617, P=0.020) and hypertension (OR=2.265, 95%CI: 1.234-4.159, P=0.008) were risk factors for SSI. Conclusions: The incidence of SSI after colorectal surgery is 5.6%. Minimally invasive surgery should be selected to reduce the occurrence of postoperative SSI. To prevent the occurrence of SSI after open surgery, skin preparation and mechanical bowel preparation should be performed before the operation, and the duration of the operation should be shortened as much as possible. In the perioperative period, care of patients with hypertension, diabetes, and contaminated or infected incisions should be given particular attention."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Cesarean section (CS) is one of the most common surgical procedures performed worldwide. Surgical-site-infection (SSI) occurs in approximately 5-10% of CS. The benefit of prophylactic antibiotics for prevention of SSI has been demonstrated in the literature. The optimal timing of antibiotic prophylaxis (prior to surgical incision versus after cord clamping) was investigated in recent studies. In January 2014, the Israeli Ministry of Health introduced a national quality measure which monitors the administration of prophylactic antibiotics in CS. The custom clinical practice in our medical center was to administer prophylactic antibiotics immediately after cord clamping. Upon introduction of the national quality measurement program, the practice was changed to administration of antibiotics prior to surgical incision. Our objective was to examine the effect of timing of prophylactic antibiotics administration on the incidence of SSI following CS, in a single medical center that performs a large volume of deliveries, with a low rate of CS.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      Taking advantage of a discrete change in clinical practice, we used retrospective data and applied difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of the timing of prophylactic antibiotics administration on SSI rates.

            "abstract": "Background: Intra-abdominal infections (IAI) remain a substantial cause of worldwide morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost burden. The World Surgical Infection Society (WSIS) was organized to help improve global outcomes from surgical infections. An initial project for the WSIS was to assess how surgeons treat common IAI in their regions. Methods: A 10-item questionnaire was distributed to members of four surgical societies dedicated to the study of surgical infections. Questions were related to common treatment decisions in the management of IAI, with the intention of identifying differences and potential controversies in patient care. Responses were analyzed by comparing percentages with 95% confidence intervals. Results: Globally, management was relatively similar for peritoneal irrigation (most commonly with saline or other crystalloid: China, 83.2% ± 5.8%; North America, 93.2% ± 6.4%; Europe, 85.7% ± 25.9%; and Latin America, 71.8% ± 6.9%). More varied responses were seen for the management of specific disease states; for instance, for cholangitis, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatic interventions were more common in North America (83.1% ± 9.6%) and less common in China (28.1% ± 7.0%). For appendiceal abscesses, percutaneous drainage and antibiotic treatment was most common in North America (93.2% ± 6.4%) and least common in Latin America (19.6% ± 6.1%). Additionally, the management of fascial and wound closures were different by region. Vacuum-assisted wound closure after fascial closure was utilized commonly in North America (32.2% ± 11.9%), Europe (28.6% ± 33.5%), and Latin America (27.6% ± 6.9%), however, was less commonly utilized in China (9.9% ± 4.4%), where there was higher rate of primary skin closure (85.7% ± 5.4%). Conclusion: Through its partnership with other surgical infection societies, the WSIS aims to develop evidence-based guidelines for more consistent pattern of IAI management globally. Delving further into why their practices differ may help improve worldwide outcomes."

Telemedicine (TM) facilitates interprofessional collaboration and patient education and enables specialist bedside consults for clients without adding to their transfer and travel risks. Evidence supports improved postoperative monitoring, access to experts, and cost savings for TM-managed patients with acute or chronic wounds in a variety of settings. Despite its limitations, including likely overdiagnosis and dependence on functioning technology, TM has been validated for surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance, reducing post vascular surgery SSI-related readmissions, and was at least as safe and effective as in-person consults during postoperative wound care in general.

            "title": "What is the value of preventing postoperative infections?",
            "abstract": "The importance of postoperative infections depends on the frequency with which infection occurs as well as on the additional cost per patient with infection. For example, in our hospital the additional cost per patient with infection after hernia repair was $600, compared with $2,106 per patient with infection after colonic surgery. However, the total excess cost per year was similar for hernia surgery ($44,800) and colon surgery ($48,440). The reason is that hernia surgery is much more common than colon surgery. It is a general principle of clinical audit that the importance of problems should be defined by their frequency as well as their individual severity. A third important consideration is the likelihood that the problem can be corrected. Undue attention has been given to the health resource costs of postoperative infection at the expense of information about the intangible costs to the patient (these are nonfinancial costs such as pain and disability). Health resource costs are very dependent on medical practice variation, and comparative studies between countries reveal marked differences in the way that apparently similar infections are managed. Moreover, comprehensive audit of infection-control management often reveals wasteful practice, e.g, antibiotic treatment of patients who do not in fact have infection. Audit of postoperative infection should focus on eliminating wasteful practice (e.g., prophylactic antibiotics continuing > 24 hrs after surgery) as well as on reducing postoperative infection rates."

This study covered the years 2008 to 2015 and included 72 equids. Enteroliths were removed from the ascending or descending colon through 1 or more enterotomies. Complications were defined as surgical site infection and/or incisional hernia formation. Follow-up by telephone questionnaire or medical records determined that 10/72 (13.9%) equids experienced complications, with 6/72 (8.3%) developing a surgical site infection and 5/72 (6.9%) a hernia. Seven of ten were presented for chronic abdominal discomfort (> 24 hours), and 8/10 had right dorsal colon and pelvic flexure enterotomies. All equids that developed an incisional hernia and 4 with surgical site infection had enteroliths > 15 cm diameter removed from the right dorsal colon. Antimicrobial powder applied to the ventral midline incision during closure significantly reduced incisional complications. Removal of > 15 cm diameter enteroliths from the right dorsal colon may predispose to postoperative incisional complications."

The knowledge of risk factor for surgical site infection after craniotomy will allow the authority to implement specific preventive measures to reduce the infection rate. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to determine the incidence and the risk factors of surgical site infection after craniotomy.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      This study highlights an observational prospective study on adult patients who has undergone neurosurgical procedures in Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) over a period of 2 years (June 2007 to June 2009). The neurosurgical procedures are craniectomy, craniotomy, cranioplasty and burrhole. A total of 390 cases fulfilled the requirements of inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study. Every patient in the study population was prospectively evaluated for development and risk factors for SSI. The follow-up cases were done by direct observation of the wound during their post-operative stay and ideally up to and including day 30 post-operatively, either as in-patients or through post discharge surveillance i.e. follow-up in the clinic 30 days post-operatively. SSIs were defined according to the Center for Disease Control definitions. Incidence was calculated per patient. Univariate Simple Logistic Regression analysis was used to analyse the association of the risk factors and SSI.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 30 post craniotomy surgical site infections (SSI) has been identified among 390 cases included in the study, resulting in an overall infection rate of 7.7%. This included 19 with superficial wound infection (63.3%), 9 with bone flap osteitis (30%) and 2 with organ/space infection (6.7%). Most of SSIs were detected during in patient cases accounting for 20 cases. The mean time between surgery and the onset of infection was 11.8 +/- 21.8 days (median 10 days). The predominantly isolated organism in patients with SSIs were Staphylococcus aureus (11 or 36%) followed by MRSA (4 or 13%), and Acinetobacter spp (3 or 10%). Independent risk factors for SSI were surgeries that were performed by specialist (OR, 76.90 CI, 1.22-39.04.9; P 0.029) and senior medical officer (OR, 8.69 CI, 1.39-54.29.04.9; P 0.021) and surgery that was done for infective causes (OR, 4.44 CI, 1.33-14.81; P 0.015).

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \nStaphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the most common cause of surgical site infections, and the nose is the most common site for S. aureus colonization. Pre-surgical (in the days prior to surgery) nasal decolonization of S. aureus may reduce the bacterial load and prevent the organisms from being transferred to the surgical site, thus reducing the risk of surgical site infection. We conducted a health technology assessment of nasal decolonization of S. aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains) with or without topical antiseptic body wash to prevent surgical site infection in patients undergoing scheduled surgery, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding nasal decolonization of S. aureus, and patient preferences and values.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence to retrieve systematic reviews and selected and reported results from one review that was recent, of high quality, and relevant to our research question. We complemented the chosen systematic review with a literature search to identify randomized controlled trials published since the systematic review was published in 2019. We used the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool to assess the risk of bias of each included systematic review and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized controlled trials to assess the risk of bias of each included primary study. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature search and conducted both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses using a decision-tree model with a 1-year time horizon from the perspective of Ontario's Ministry of Health. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding nasal decolonization of S. aureus in pre-surgical patients in Ontario. To contextualize the potential value of nasal decolonization, we spoke with people who had recently undergone surgery, some of whom had received nasal decolonization, and one family member of a person who had recently had surgery. We also engaged participants through an online survey.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We included one systematic review and three randomized controlled trials in the clinical evidence review. In universal decolonization, compared with placebo or no intervention, nasal mupirocin alone may result in little to no difference in the incidence of overall and S. aureus-related surgical site infections in pre-surgical patients undergoing orthopaedic, cardiothoracic, general, oncologic, gynaecologic, neurologic, or abdominal digestive surgeries, regardless of S. aureus carrier status (GRADE: Moderate to Very low). Compared with placebo, nasal mupirocin alone may result in little to no difference in the incidence of overall and S. aureus-related surgical site infections in pre-surgical patients who are S. aureus carriers undergoing cardiothoracic, vascular, orthopaedic, gastrointestinal, general, oncologic, gynaecologic, or neurologic surgery (GRADE: Moderate to Very low). In targeted decolonization, compared with placebo, nasal mupirocin combined with chlorhexidine body wash lowers the incidence of S. aureus-related surgical site infection (risk ratio: 0.32 [95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.62]) in pre-surgical patients who are S. aureus carriers undergoing cardiothoracic, vascular, orthopaedic, gastrointestinal, or general surgery (GRADE: High). Compared with no intervention, nasal mupirocin combined with chlorhexidine body wash in pre-surgical patients who are not S. aureus carriers undergoing orthopaedic surgery may have little to no effect on overall surgical site infection, but the evidence is very uncertain (GRADE: Very low). Most included studies did not separate methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus. No significant antimicrobial resistance was identified in the evidence reviewed; however, the existing literature was not adequately powered and did not have sufficient follow-up time to evaluate antimicrobial resistance.Our economic evaluation found that universal nasal decolonization using mupirocin combined with chlorhexidine body wash is less costly and more effective than both targeted and no nasal decolonization. Compared with no nasal decolonization treatment, universal and targeted nasal decolonization using mupirocin combined with chlorhexidine body wash would prevent 32 and 22 S. aureus-related surgical site infections, respectively, per 10,000 patients. Universal nasal decolonization would lead to cost savings, whereas targeted nasal decolonization would increase the overall cost for the health care system since patients must first be screened for S. aureus carrier status before receiving nasal decolonization with mupirocin. The annual budget impact of publicly funding universal nasal decolonization in Ontario over the next 5 years ranges from a savings of $2.98 million in year 1 to a savings of $15.09 million in year 5. The annual budget impact of publicly funding targeted nasal decolonization ranges from an additional cost of $0.08 million in year 1 to an additional cost of $0.39 million in year 5.Our interview and survey respondents felt strongly about the value of preventing surgical site infections, and most favoured a universal approach.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Based on the best evidence available, decolonization of S. aureus using nasal mupirocin combined with chlorhexidine body wash prior to cardiothoracic, vascular, orthopaedic, gastrointestinal, or general surgery lowers the incidence of surgical site infection caused by S. aureus in patients who are S. aureus carriers (including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains) (i.e., targeted decolonization). However, nasal mupirocin alone may result in little to no difference in overall surgical site infections and S. aureus-related surgical site infections in pre-surgical patients prior to orthopaedic, cardiothoracic, general, oncologic, gynaecologic, neurologic, or abdominal digestive surgeries, regardless of their S. aureus carrier status (i.e., universal decolonization). No significant antimicrobial resistance was identified in the evidence reviewed.Compared with no nasal decolonization treatment, universal nasal decolonization with mupirocin combined with chlorhexidine body wash may reduce S. aureus-related surgical site infections and lead to cost savings. Targeted nasal decolonization with mupirocin combined with chlorhexidine body wash may also reduce S. aureus-related surgical site infections but increase the overall cost of treatment for the health care system. We estimate that publicly funding universal nasal decolonization using mupirocin combined with chlorhexidine body wash would result in a total cost savings of $45.08 million over the next 5 years, whereas publicly funding targeted nasal decolonization using mupirocin combined with chlorhexidine body wash would incur an additional cost of $1.17 million over the next 5 years.People undergoing surgery value treatments aimed at preventing surgical site infections."

One of the lions was aged, overweight, and considered an anesthetic risk. The animals were anesthetized, intubated, catheterized intravenously, and placed in dorsal recumbency with the head lower (Trendelenburg position). Ventilation was assisted mechanically. Following abdominal insufflation, a surgical trocar was placed in the abdominal cavity. Two additional 12-mm surgical trocars were placed under direct visualization using a videoscope. The ovaries and uterus were removed endoscopically, and the abdominal cavity was inspected for hemorrhage under decreased insufflation pressure before closure. The surgery was complicated by obesity, by uterine enlargement from cystic endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial polyps, and by ovarian enlargement and fragility because of bilateral cystic rete ovarii. The procedure and anesthetic recovery were uneventful. Postsurgical recovery time and convalescence lasted less than 3 days, and the animals were reintroduced to an exhibit mate and placed on exhibit within 8 days. The technique is appropriate for use in lions, even those with pathologic reproductive changes, in zoos."

Materials and Methods: In April and May 2020, an online survey comprised of questions regarding past and current VH practices, as well as plans for future use was distributed among eye care providers nationwide. Results: Of the 117 eye care providers who completed the survey, 96.6% were not using VH before the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, 77.4% reported using VH during the pandemic. The majority of visits were for red eye (64.4%, n = 56) and ocular surface complaints (58.6%, n = 51). Examination components tested virtually varied, but most respondents felt these were at least \"somewhat reliable.\" Almost half of respondents (45%) felt it was \"very easy\" or \"somewhat easy\" to implement VH and the majority (53.8%, n = 43) were able to get it up and running in under a week. The majority felt the transition to VH was positive (57.5%), however, only 50.4% (n = 53) of those providers planned to use VH regularly once able to see patients safely in clinic again. Conclusions: While the majority of U.S. eye care providers who responded were not using VH before the COVID-19 pandemic, just months into the U.S. outbreak, 77.4% were using VH in their daily practice. In general, providers used these platforms for urgent examinations, adnexal disease, and postoperative care most often. The majority felt the transition was a positive one, however, only half planned to continue regular use of VH once the pandemic ended."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      High body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased rates of complications after total knee arthroplasty. To date, to our knowledge, studies have examined risk as a dichotomous variable using specific BMI thresholds. The purpose of this investigation was to quantify implant survival and the risk of common complications after total knee arthroplasty using BMI as a continuous variable.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using prospectively collected data from our institutional total joint registry, we analyzed 22,289 consecutive knees, in 16,136 patients, treated with primary total knee arthroplasty from 1985 to 2012. The mean BMI of these patients at the time of the surgical procedure was 31.3 kg/m (range, 11 to 69 kg/m). The Kaplan-Meier survival method was used to estimate survivorship, reoperations, and common complications, with associations of outcomes assessed using a Cox regression model.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Utilizing smoothing spline parameterization, we found that reoperation (p < 0.001) and implant revision or removal rates (p < 0.001) increased with increasing BMI after total knee arthroplasty. Increasing BMI also was associated with increased rates of wound infection (hazard ratio [HR], 1.07; p < 0.001) and deep infection (HR, 1.08; p < 0.001) per unit of BMI over 35 kg/m. A BMI of 35 to 40 kg/m was associated with a higher rate of implant revision for aseptic loosening (p < 0.001) and for polyethylene wear (p < 0.001) compared with a BMI of 18 to 24.99 kg/m. There was no correlation between BMI and risk of venous thromboembolism, tibiofemoral instability, or need for knee manipulation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The rates of reoperation, implant revision or removal, and many common complications after total knee arthroplasty were strongly associated with BMI.\n    \n\n\n          Level of evidence:\n        \n      \n      Prognostic Level IV.

Several mechanisms of antibiotic resistance are reviewed for both gram-negative and gram-positive nosocomial pathogens. These adaptive resistance mechanisms allow organisms to survive in an environment of extensive antibiotic use and result in clinically significant infections. Mobile genetic elements have facilitated the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance within and among species. The clinical challenge faced by many practitioners is to understand these mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and to develop strategies for successfully treating infection caused by resistant pathogens. Nosocomial outbreaks caused by resistant organisms are described, and an approach to empiric therapy based on presumed pathogens, site of infection, and local resistance patterns is discussed."

The objective of antibiotic prophylaxis is to reduce the risk of postoperative local and systemic infections. Burn surgery is associated with a high incidence of bacteremia, postoperative infections, and sepsis. However, antibiotic prophylaxis exposes patients to the risk of selecting drug-resistant pathogens as well as to the adverse effects of antibiotics (i.e., Clostridium difficile colitis). The lack of data precludes any strong international recommendations regarding perioperative prophylaxis using systemic antibiotics in this setting.

The second aim is to suggest reasons why some recent studies have failed to demonstrate that ultraclean air (UCA) systems reduce deep joint infection after TJA. It demonstrates that if a UCA system establishes average airborne concentrations of microbe-carrying particles (MCPs) <10/m3, and preferably <1/m3, then deep joint infection after TJA will be lower than in conventionally ventilated operating theatres."

            "title": "Use of digital health kits to reduce readmission after cardiac surgery.",
            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Unintended rehospitalizations after surgical procedures represent a large percentage of readmissions and have been associated with increased morbidity and cost of care. Beginning in 2017, Medicare will expand diagnostic categories subject to financial penalties for excess postoperative readmissions to include coronary revascularization procedures. Arrhythmias and pulmonary complications comprise the largest categories for readmission after cardiac surgery. Technologic advances in remote monitoring have led to the use of web-based digital health kits (DHK) aimed at reducing readmissions and improving postoperative outcomes. The present study was performed to determine the added benefit of incorporating DHK's into a formal readmissions reduction program (RRP) in preventing 30-d readmissions and to evaluate patient and provider satisfaction with the use of these devices.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a prospective study of all adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution from March 2014 to June 2015. During the study period, 443 adult patients (mean age, 65 ± 14, 33% female) were identified and participated in the formal RRP, 27 of whom also received a DHK after discharge (416 control group). In addition to providing a live video link to a provider specializing in cardiac surgery, the DHK also allowed for automatic daily transmission of weight, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure. Patients also completed a daily health survey targeting symptoms concerning for heart failure, poor wound healing, poor ambulation, and nonadherence to medications. Abnormal vitals or survey responses triggered automatic notifications to the healthcare team. Satisfaction surveys were administered to participants and members of the healthcare team. Pearson χ(2) test and the Welch's t-test were used to assess statistical differences in baseline characteristics and outcome variables.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      During the study period, the readmission rate for the DHK and control groups were similar (7.4% versus 9.9%, P = 0.65). The use of DHKs led to 1649 alerts and 144 interventions, with the highest number of alerts occurring during d 5-9. The majority of alerts (64%) were prompted by abnormal biometric measurements, and a significant correlation was noted between abnormal biometrics and required intervention (r = 0.62, P < 0.001). No correlation was seen between alerts because of health survey responses (r = 0.07, P = 0.71) or missed check-ins (r = 0.06, P = 0.76) and required interventions. Poststudy satisfaction surveys showed an overall satisfaction rating of 4.9 ± 0.5 for DHK patients and 4.9 ± 0.2 for members of the care team (scale 1-5, 5 = agree).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In our study, adding DHKs to a formal RRP was not associated with a significant decrease in 30-d readmission rates. We also found that notifications because of abnormal biometric measures were significantly correlated with required interventions. In contrast, notifications due to abnormal health survey responses were not associated with increased interventions. Both patients and members of the healthcare team were highly satisfied with this technology. DHKs appear to extend care beyond the inpatient period and provide a portal for telemonitoring of surgical patients. However, this modality is highly resource intensive and may not significantly reduce readmissions. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of such kits in reducing readmissions and costs of care."

            "abstract": "Post-discharge surgical wound infection surveillance is an important part of many infection control programs. It is frequently undertaken by patient self-assessment, prompted either by a telephone or postal questionnaire. To assess the reliability of this method, 290 patients were followed for six weeks postoperatively. Their wounds were photographed and also covertly assessed for signs of infection by two experienced infection control nurses (ICNs). Patients also responded to a postal questionnaire seeking evidence of infection at both week four and week six post-surgery. Correlation between the patient's assessment of their wound and the ICNs diagnosis was poor (r = 0.37) with a low positive predictive value (28.7%), although negative predictive value was high (98.2%). Assessment of photos for signs of infection by two experienced clinicians also correlated poorly with the ICNs diagnosis of infection (r = 0.54). The patient's recall of prescription of an antibiotic by their general practitioner (GP) for wound infection during the postoperative period correlated best with the ICNs diagnosis (r = 0.76). This latter measure, particularly when confirmed by the GP in those patients reporting an infection, appears to provide the most valid and resource efficient marker of post-discharge surgical wound infection."

For surgical care, a unique opportunity exists to capture patient-generated health data (PGHD) including photographs. As part of a broader initiative to evaluate PGHD for surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance, we sought evidence regarding patient involvement and experience with PGHD for SSI monitoring and surveillance. Methods: Through a scoping review of the literature and semi-structured stakeholder interviews we gathered evidence on what is currently known about patient perspectives of and experiences with mobile health (mHealth) interventions for post-operative recovery. We presented findings to and discussed with the ASSIST PGHD Stakeholder Advisory Group (PSAG) to generate priorities for further examination. Results: Our scoping review yielded 34 studies that addressed post-discharge use of PGHD for monitoring and surveillance of SSI. Of these, 16 studies addressed at least one outcome regarding patient experience; the most commonly measured outcome was patient satisfaction. Only three studies reported on patient involvement in the development of PGHD tools and interventions. We conducted interviews (n = 24) representing a range of stakeholder perspectives. Interviewees stressed the importance of patient involvement in tool and program design, noting patient involvement ensures the \"work\" that patients do in their daily lives to manage their health and healthcare is recognized. Discussion of evidence with the ASSIST PSAG resulted in formal recommendations for direct involvement of patients and caregivers for future work. Conclusions: While mHealth initiatives to advance post-operative management offer the ability to improve patient engagement, work is needed to ensure the patient voice is reflected. Active engagement with patients and caregivers in the development of new technology, the design of new workflows, and the conduct of research and evaluation ensures that the patient experiences and values are incorporated."

Modest to substantial clinical improvements after DBS surgery were observed in some but not all patients, whereas stimulation-related side effects were reported by 2 patients and included reversible sleep and mood problems, headache, and a sensation of heat.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      DBS telemedicine seems to offer a feasible, safe, and efficient strategy for maintaining the delivery of medical care to psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. The authors propose that implementation of a comprehensive DBS telemedicine system, which combines DBS teleprogramming with psychological counseling, medical consultations, and medication prescriptions and delivery, could be an efficient and effective approach to manage the mental health and quality of life of patients with psychiatric disorders during future local or global public health crises."

            "abstract": "Background: Patients increasingly use mobile devices to send text messages and photographic data to surgeons. There is potential to harness this patient-generated health data (PGHD) for clinical and public health surveillance of surgical site infection (SSI). Leveraging PGHD collected via remote monitoring in the post-operative period has the potential to produce important benefits for patients, surgeons, care teams, and infection surveillance and prevention. Methods: We conducted a health technology assessment (HTA), drawing heavily on stakeholder engagement to better understand current and potential uses of PGHD in post-operative care. Stakeholder engagement activities included assembling an advisory board composed of stakeholder experts, interviewing key informants, and seeking out stakeholder guidance to synthesize evidence from interviews, literature review, and technical app review in order to develop recommendations on the use of PGHD in SSI surveillance. Results: We conducted a review of the published literature, a technical/market scan of available apps for capturing post-operative PGHD, and two rounds of key informant interviews with stakeholders. In addition, we held a day-long workshop to solicit stakeholder feedback on initial findings of the project and to guide additional work. These activities culminated in an HTA report that provides guidance and recommendations on the use of PGHD in SSI surveillance, including practice, research, and public health surveillance, and identifies open issues on post-operative use of PGHD for which additional evidence and experience are needed to optimize application of those data for clinical and public health purposes. Conclusion: Stakeholders, individuals with direct experience, or interest in a given topic are critical to the HTA process. They provide insight to guide the work conducted, ensure that the topics addressed are relevant and important, and that products of the work are accessible and meaningful to the individuals who will be most impacted."

            "abstract": "Although wound care has been practiced for centuries, telewound care is a relatively new concept. Currently, only a few pilot programs are in existence. Telewound care has yet to achieve the popularity and recognition of its other telemedicine predecessors amongst members of the health care industry and public alike. The tremendous potential of incorporating the technology of telemedicine into wound care needs to be realized. Wound care is a representation of the care of chronic and debilitating conditions that require long-term specialized care. We have seen the positive effects of improved living conditions and advances in health care globally. The result: people are now living longer. Every day a small piece is added to the pie: the percentage of world's elderly and those with chronic medical conditions that would require medical attention is rising. With the escalating costs of health care, and the push of the industry towards outpatient care, this is a part of the health care crisis that is demanding our immediate attention. We have seen positive outcomes in the care of other chronic medial conditions using telemedicine such as home telecare programs. In addition, the effectiveness of several programs using available advances in technology such as the field of radiology has been established. Wound care can build on success created in these fields to create an effective and useful method of care. The aim of this chapter is to recognize the impact of this problem, to introduce several pilot programs in several different aspects of wound care and to build on current resources in order to achieve a novel method of wound care. The goal would be to create a technologically advanced, cost-effective and user-friendly program, and be able to bridge the gap between the sick and available specialized care. Both store-and-forward technology and televideo have a role to play in telewound care, the latter greater in the role of home telecare and teleconsultation, and the former in post-operative patients and the follow-up of chronic wounds. Either way, both have been underutilized and underdeveloped. With the advances in the field of telecommunications in connecting people across distances at a fraction of the time and costs, improved outcomes reported in other fields of telemedicine and positive legislative changes, there is an enormous potential in this field. We now have the ability, knowledge and resources to develop telewound care programs, which can provide high quality patient care in a more concise and cost-effective way. It is certainly a welcoming relief to a field that has traditionally been known to pose an emotional, physical and financial drain to all those involved."

The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis undergoing nonhepatic surgery. We studied 135 patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing nonhepatic procedures and 86 controls matched by age, sex, and preoperative diagnosis. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables associated with 30-day mortality and morbidity were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients with cirrhosis showed higher blood transfusion requirements, longer length of hospital stay, and a higher number of complications than controls. The mortality rate was 16.3% in cirrhotics and 3.5% in controls. By univariate analysis, the need for transfusions, prothrombin time, and Child-Pugh score were significantly associated with postoperative liver decompensation, whereas duration of surgery, prothrombin time, Child-Pugh score, cirrhosis-related complications, and general complications were significantly associated with mortality. In the multivariate analysis, Child-Pugh score (odds ratio [OR] 24.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.5 to 106); duration of surgery (OR 5; 95% CI 1.2 to 15.6), and postoperative general complications (OR 3.7; 95% CI 3.4 to 6.4) were independent predictors of mortality.

            "abstract": "Surgical wound infections (SWIs) after coronary artery by-pass graft (CABG) within 30 and 60 days of operation were registered. Already known risk factors and possible risk factors for wound infection were studied. SWIs of sternal and/or leg wounds have been reported to occur in 2-20% of patients after CABG. Deep sternal infection, mediastinitis, occurs after 0.5-5% of CABG procedures. The duration and methods of follow-up, as well as definitions of SWI, vary in different studies. Previously known and possible new risk factors were registered for 374 patients. Patients were contacted by telephone 30 and 60 days after surgery and interviewed in accordance with a questionnaire about symptoms and signs of wound infections. Our definition of SWI was based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition. SWIs were diagnosed in 114 of 374 (30.5%) of the patients. In total SWI were diagnosed in 120 surgical-site incisions. Almost all SWIs of the sternum (93.3%) were diagnosed within 30 days of surgery. Most of the SWIs of the leg (73%) were diagnosed within 30 days of surgery and 27% were diagnosed within 31 to 60 days of surgery. Being female was the most important risk factor for SWI of the leg. Low preoperative haemoglobin concentrations were the most important risk factor for superficial SWI on the sternum. Patients with mediastinitis had higher BMI and had more often received erythrocyte transfusions on postoperative day two or later than those without infections."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Wound infections following spinal surgery for deformity place a high toll on patients, providers, and the health care system. The prophylactic application of intraoperative vancomycin powder has been shown to lower the infection risk after thoracolumbar decompression and fusion for deformity correction. The purpose of this study was to assess the microbiological patterns of postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs) after prophylactic use of vancomycin powder in adult patients undergoing spinal deformity surgery. METHODS All cases involving adult patients who underwent spinal deformity reconstruction at Duke University Medical Center between 2011 and 2013 with a minimum of 3 months of clinical follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. In all cases included in the study, crystalline vancomycin powder was applied to the surgical bed for infection prophylaxis. Baseline characteristics, operative details, rates of wound infection, and microbiological data for each case were gathered by direct medical record review. RESULTS A total of 1200 consecutive spine operations were performed for deformity between 2011 and 2013. Review of the associated records demonstrated 34 cases of SSI, yielding an SSI rate of 2.83%. The patients' mean age (± SD) was 62.08 ± 14.76 years. The patients' mean body mass index was 30.86 ± 7.15 kg/m2, and 29.41% had a history of diabetes. The average dose of vancomycin powder was 1.41 ± 2.77 g (range 1-7 g). Subfascial drains were placed in 88% of patients. All SSIs occurred within 30 days of surgery, with deep wound infections accounting for 50%. In 74% of the SSIs cultures were positive, with about half the organisms being gram negative, such as Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morgani, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There were no adverse clinical outcomes related to the local application of vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that in the setting of prophylactic vancomycin powder use, the preponderance of SSIs are caused by gram-negative organisms or are polymicrobial. Further randomized control trials of prophylactic adjunctive measures are warranted to help guide the choice of empirical antibiotic therapy while awaiting culture data."

            "abstract": "Vascular infections typically include those of surgical sites, prosthetic grafts, and vascular ulcers, including some diabetic foot ulcers. Each of these infections represents a serious health concern, particularly among individuals with comorbid conditions who are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Surgical site infections occur primarily as a result of contamination by skin organisms during surgery, whereas prosthetic graft infections result typically from a progressive wound infection. Diabetic foot ulcers and infections are especially complicated and difficult to treat. They occur in individuals with systemic illness that has compromising effects on the nervous, vascular, musculoskeletal, and immunologic systems. Vascular infections, like those elsewhere in the body, reflect an imbalance between the host and bacteria. Efforts to limit or prevent the likelihood of patients developing these infections centre on reducing the bacterial inoculum by means of asepsis and antisepsis. As well as size of the bacterial inoculum, the bacterial properties of pathogenicity and resulting virulence are also significant. The most frequent pathogenic bacteria encountered in surgical patients are Gram-positive cocci (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci). Strains with multiple antibiotic resistance (e.g. meticillin resistant S. aureus [MRSA], S. epidermidis, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE]) can cause significant surgical site infection problems. Local resistance patterns and surveillance efforts are essential to ensure appropriate empiric antibiotic selection for prophylaxis or treatment."

There are few studies describing surgical outcomes in Africa.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We did a 7-day, international, prospective, observational cohort study of patients aged 18 years and older undergoing any inpatient surgery in 25 countries in Africa (the African Surgical Outcomes Study). We aimed to recruit as many hospitals as possible using a convenience sampling survey, and required data from at least ten hospitals per country (or half the surgical centres if there were fewer than ten hospitals) and data for at least 90% of eligible patients from each site. Each country selected one recruitment week between February and May, 2016. The primary outcome was in-hospital postoperative complications, assessed according to predefined criteria and graded as mild, moderate, or severe. Data were presented as median (IQR), mean (SD), or n (%), and compared using t tests. This study is registered on the South African National Health Research Database (KZ_2015RP7_22) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03044899).\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      We recruited 11 422 patients (median 29 [IQR 10-70]) from 247 hospitals during the national cohort weeks. Hospitals served a median population of 810 000 people (IQR 200 000-2 000 000), with a combined number of specialist surgeons, obstetricians, and anaesthetists totalling 0·7 (0·2-1·9) per 100 000 population. Hospitals did a median of 212 (IQR 65-578) surgical procedures per 100 000 population each year. Patients were younger (mean age 38·5 years [SD 16·1]), with a lower risk profile (American Society of Anesthesiologists median score 1 [IQR 1-2]) than reported in high-income countries. 1253 (11%) patients were infected with HIV, 6504 procedures (57%) were urgent or emergent, and the most common procedure was caesarean delivery (3792 patients, 33%). Postoperative complications occurred in 1977 (18·2%, 95% CI 17·4-18·9]) of 10 885 patients. 239 (2·1%) of 11 193 patients died, 225 (94·1%) after the day of surgery. Infection was the most common complication (1156 [10·2%] of 10 970 patients), of whom 112 (9·7%) died.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Despite a low-risk profile and few postoperative complications, patients in Africa were twice as likely to die after surgery when compared with the global average for postoperative deaths. Initiatives to increase access to surgical treatments in Africa therefore should be coupled with improved surveillance for deteriorating physiology in patients who develop postoperative complications, and the resources necessary to achieve this objective.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      Medical Research Council of South Africa."

            "abstract": "The use of antibiotic prophylaxis in head and neck oncologic surgery has greatly reduced the risk of postoperative wound infection and the corresponding increase in morbidity and health care costs. Conversely, inappropriate perioperative use of antibiotics increases costs and risk to patients. Antibiotic prophylaxis is beneficial only in clean-contaminated head and neck surgery; targets are the bacterial flora that commonly inhabit the skin and upper aerodigestive tract, with antibiotics effective against gram-positive aerobic organisms and anaerobic organisms providing the best coverage. Maximum efficacy is achieved with immediate preoperative and short-term (less than 48 hours) postoperative antimicrobial administration in adequate doses. Optimum benefit from prophylaxis in head and neck oncologic surgery depends on appropriate selection and administration of antibiotics in combination with sound, established surgical principles."

Although robotic surgery has become widely used in oncologic surgery, analysis of safety is lacking in comparison to traditional techniques. Standardized assessment of robotic surgical outcomes and adverse events following oncologic surgery is necessary for quality improvement with innovative technology. Between 2003 and 2016, 10,013 unique robotic operations were performed in 9,858 patients. Our prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed for hospital readmissions and Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ 2 complications within 30 days. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of surgical complications and hospital readmissions. Cases were stratified by discipline: genitourinary (n = 8240), gynecologic (n = 857), thoracic (n = 457), gastrointestinal (n = 322), hepatobiliary (n = 60), ear/nose/throat (n = 44) and general (n = 33). Intraoperative complications occurred in 42 surgeries (0.4%). Postoperative complications occurred in 946 patients [9.4%, highest grade 2 (n = 574), 3 (n = 288), 4 (n = 72), 5 (n = 10)]. Most frequent complications were ileus (154, 16.3%), anemia (91, 9.6%), cardiac arrhythmia (62, 6.6%), deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolus (47, 5.0%), wound infection (45, 4.8%) and urinary leak (43, 4.5%). 405 patients (4.0%) required readmission. Most common causes for hospital readmission were ileus (44, 10.9%), urinary leak (23, 5.7%), urinary tract infection (23, 5.7%), intra-abdominal abscess/fluid collection (23, 5.7%), and small bowel obstruction (19, 4.7%). On multivariable analysis, longer operative time and older age predicted complications and readmissions (p ≤ 0.02). Robotic-assisted surgery appears a safe for oncologic surgery with acceptable hospital readmission and complication rates. Older age and longer operative time were associated with complications and readmission."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Most of surgical site infections (SSI) are caused by commensal and pathogenic agents from the patient's microbiota, which may include antibiotic resistant strains. Pre-surgical asepsis of the skin is one of the preventive measures performed to reduce SSI incidence and also antibiotic resistance dissemination. However, in veterinary medicine there is no agreement on which biocide is the most effective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of two pre-surgical skin asepsis protocols in dogs. A total of 46 animals were randomly assigned for an asepsis protocol with an aqueous solution of 7.5% povidone-iodine or with an alcoholic solution of 2% chlorhexidine. For each dog, two skin swab samples were collected at pre-asepsis and post-asepsis, for bacterial quantification by conventional techniques and isolation of methicillin-resistant species.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Most samples collected at the post-asepsis did not present bacterial growth, both for the animals subjected to the povidone-iodine (74%) or to the chlorhexidine (70%) protocols. In only 9% of the cases a significant bacterial logarithmic reduction was not observed, indicating possible resistance to these agents. Also, the logarithmic reduction of the bacterial quantification from pre- and post-asepsis time, was not statistically different for povidone-iodine (6.51 ± 1.94 log10) and chlorhexidine (6.46 ± 2.62 log10) protocol. From the 39% pre-asepsis swabs which showed bacterial growth in MRSA modified chromogenic agar medium, only one isolate was identified as Staphylococcus aureus and one as S. epidermidis. False positives were mainly other staphylococci species, as well as Enterobacteriaceae.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Pre-surgical skin asepsis protocols with povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine showed similar efficacy in the elimination of methicillin resistant bacteria and preventing surgical site infections in dogs undergoing surgery."

The study involved review of medical records including radiology, office visits, and telephone contacts for six patients, referred for postoperative HBO therapy in 2003-2005. Infection control and healing without removal of implants or major revision surgery with a minimum of 2-year follow-up after index surgery were considered to represent success. All infections were resolved. Median time for wound healing, normalisation of blood tests and antibiotic weaning were 3 months. Radiological bony fusion, intact implants without any signs of radiolucent zones were seen in all cases at a mean follow-up of 54 months (37-72). Side effects of HBO treatment were minor. HBO is a safe and potentially useful adjuvance in the treatment of early deep postoperative infections in complex situations with spinal implants in high risk paediatric patients."

Seventeen prospective participants were invited to be members of the Delphi Panel of which 13 agreed to be involved. The panel suggested that an ideal wound dressing would conform easily to the wound, be easy to apply and remove, allow for swelling and minimise pain on removal. Participants were in agreement that the primary wound dressing should be left in situ for as long as possible, providing there was no excessive oozing or signs of infection. The authors recognise that the Delphi Panel was relatively compact; however, the study arguably provides some useful data that can be used to identify the consequences of wound blistering and important factors that need to be considered when choosing a wound dressing to prevent blistering."

The move to surgical podiatrists in the National Health Service within the United Kingdom will shift the surgical workload away from orthopaedic surgeons. A devastating complication of foot and ankle surgery is postoperative infection. While postoperative infection is multifactorial in etiology, concomitant diabetes mellitus increases the general risk of trauma and orthopaedic surgical site infections up to 8-fold. We therefore undertook a prospective study of our unit antibiotic prophylaxis regimes. Fifty patients participated. Swabs were obtained using aseptic technique from the plantar aspect of the feet, between the toes, and subsequently cultured on agar plates. Specimens were then incubated for 48 hours before being exposed to antibiotic plates. Cultured organisms were classified as susceptible to an antibiotic regimen if susceptibility to cefuroxime, or susceptibility to either drug of the flucloxacillin/gentamicin combination, was demonstrated. Statistical analysis e was performed. A P value <.05 was considered significant. Fifty patients were recruited, 26 (52%) were male. Mean age of 53 ± 19.4 years. The cohort included 15 diabetic, of which 11 (73.3%) insulin-dependent, and 35 nondiabetic patients. Comparing flucloxacillin/gentamicin against cefuroxime overall, susceptibility was noted in 84% and 70%, respectively (P = .096). Resistance to cefuroxime was significantly higher in diabetics than in nondiabetics (53% vs 25%, P = .046). The same pattern was observed for the flucloxacillin/gentamicin regimen (33% vs 9%, P = .049). While both regimens are active against colonizing organisms in this prospective observational study, flucloxacillin and gentamicin provide greater coverage overall.

A decision analytic model was developed from UK National Health Service perspective using data from a single-centre trial. 220 patients were randomized to treatment with either single-use negative pressure wound therapy or standard care i.e., film dressings of clinician choice and followed for 6 weeks. Outcomes included dressing changes, length of stay, surgical site complications, cost and quality adjusted life years. The randomized controlled trial reported a reduction in dressing changes (p = 0.002), SSC (p = 0.06) and LOS (p = 0.07) in favor of single-use negative pressure wound therapy compared with standard care. The model estimated 0.116 and 0.115 QALY gained, 0.98 and 0.92 complications avoided for single-use negative pressure wound therapy and standard care, respectively. The cost/patient was £5,602 ($7,954) and £6,713 ($9,559) for single-use negative pressure wound therapy and standard care respectively resulting in cost-saving of £1,132 ($1,607) in favor of single-use negative pressure wound therapy. Greater savings were observed in subgroups of higher risk patients with BMI ≥ 35 and ASA ≥ 3 i.e., £7,955 ($11,296) and £7,248 ($10,293), respectively. The findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. In conclusion, single-use negative pressure wound therapy can be considered a cost saving intervention to reduce surgical site complications following primary hip and knee replacements compared with standard care.

Post-discharge surveillance has important cost implications for both primary and acute areas of the NHS and it is therefore important to establish a robust method to obtain these data. This study used an automated telephony system to gain information on SSI developing post-discharge. The patients included were those who had inpatient surveillance carried out following hip and knee replacements, and cardiac surgery. A recorded message was used to ask the patient questions concerning the state of their wound. These questions were answered by pressing numbers on their phone. The study population was 104 and there were 18 patients who thought they had a wound infection but after clarification only nine patients suffered a post-discharge SSI. The number of patients who responded with at least one call to the system was 62. Although this pilot study was carried out with small numbers, it was felt that with certain refinements it should continue to be used for post-discharge surgical site surveillance of infection."

            "abstract": "Background:A major byproduct of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been the accelerated adoption of telemedicine within orthopedic practices.Introduction:The purpose of the study is to evaluate satisfaction associated with telemedicine and to determine how telemedicine is used by orthopedic surgeons in response to social distancing efforts necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods:We developed a survey to evaluate surgeon's perception of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey consisted of four major sections focusing on (1) surgeon characteristics and current use of telemedicine, (2) telemedicine for new patients, (3) telemedicine for routine follow-up patients, and (4) telemedicine for postoperative patients.Results:We collected 268 survey responses. Overall, 84.8% of surgeons were using telemedicine, but only 20.5% of surgeons were using it before the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall satisfaction with telemedicine was 70.3% ± 20.9%. Of those who use telemedicine, 75% currently use it for new patients, 86.6% currently use it for routine follow-up patients, and 80.8% currently use it for postoperative patients (p = 0.01). Surgeons had higher satisfaction with building rapport and performing physical examination maneuvers for either routine follow-up or postoperative patients than for new patients (p < 0.0001 for both). However, satisfaction with obtaining imaging did not differ among the cohorts (p = 0.36). Surgeons felt they are more likely to continue to use telemedicine after the COVID-19 pandemic for either routine follow-up or postoperative patients than for new patients (p < 0.0001).Discussion:Owing to challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine use has increased substantially among orthopedic surgeons in recent months.Conclusions:Our study established that physician implementation of telemedicine has increased significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the majority of surgeons satisfied with its use in their practice, and plan on incorporating telemedicine in their practices beyond the pandemic."

Elimination of redundant images resulted in 104 image encounters, with 76 discrete encounters in 41 patients related to the surgical wound. Most showed normal wound appearance; patients were reassured and urgent visits were avoided. At scheduled in-person follow-up, none of these patients demonstrated unrecognized wound complications. Seventeen image encounters in 7 patients showed possible wound abnormalities. These prompted in-person follow-up on average less than 1 day later for 4 issues deemed urgent (2 patients received surgical treatment) and 5 days later for issues deemed nonurgent. Photos were also used to monitor abnormal wounds over time and to send information unrelated to wounds.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Utilization of an online physician-patient messaging platform can prevent unnecessary visits for normal appearing wounds, while facilitating rapid in-person treatment of wound complications."

Without post-discharge surveillance (PDS) data, the rate and burden of surgical site infections (SSIs) are underestimated. PDS data for colorectal surgery in the UK remains to be published. This is an important specialty to study since it is considered to have the highest SSI rate and is among the most expensive to treat. This study of colorectal SSI used a 30 day surveillance programme with telephone interviews and home visits. Each additional healthcare resource used by patients with SSI was documented and costed. Of the 105 patients who met the inclusion criteria and completed the 30 day follow-up, 29 (27%) developed SSI, of which 12 were diagnosed after discharge. The mean number of days to presentation of SSI was 13. Multivariable logistic analysis identified body mass index as the only significant risk factor. The additional cost of treating each infected patient was pound sterling 10,523, although 15% of these additional costs were met by primary care. The 5 month surveillance programme cost pound sterling 5,200 to run. An analysis of the surveillance nurse's workload showed that the nurse could be replaced by a healthcare assistant. PDS to detect SSI after colorectal surgery is necessary to provide complete data with accurate additional costs."

Pre-discharge wound surveillance was performed by clinical assessment by an independent researcher on the fifth (or later) postoperative day. Post-discharge wound surveillance was performed by a mail out of questionnaires completed independently by patients and surgeons.\n## RESULTS\nOverall, 138 wound infections were diagnosed (incidence 10.1%), of which fewer than one-third (n = 44) were diagnosed before discharge (average 10.4 days postoperatively) and the remainder (n = 94) after discharge (average 20.6 days postoperatively). Seven hundred and eighty-two (57.5%) post-discharge survey forms were returned by patients and 680 (50.0%) by surgeons. When forms were returned by both surgeons and patients for the same wound (641 cases), there was substantial agreement in diagnosing infection or no infection (kappa = 0.73).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe majority of nosocomial surgical wound infections develop after the patients' discharge from hospital. A post-discharge surveillance programme including self-reporting of infections by patients and return of questionnaires by patients and surgeons is feasible in an Australian hospital setting. However, such a programme is labour and resource intensive and strategies to increase return of questionnaires are required.\n"

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Surgical site infection rates in the month following surgery vary from 1% to 5%. Due to the large number of surgical procedures conducted annually, the costs of these surgical site infections (SSIs) can be considerable in financial and social terms. Nasal decontamination using antibiotics or antiseptics is performed to reduce the risk of SSIs by preventing organisms from the nasal cavity being transferred to the skin where a surgical incision will be made. Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus) colonises the nasal cavity and skin of carriers and can cause infection in open or unhealed surgical wounds. S aureus is the leading nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pathogen in hospitals worldwide. The potential effectiveness of nasal decontamination of S aureus is thought to be dependent on both the antibiotic/antiseptic used and the dose of application; however, it is unclear whether nasal decontamination actually reduces postoperative wound infection in S aureus carriers.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effects of nasal decontamination on preventing surgical site infections (SSIs) in people who are S aureus carriers undergoing surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      In September 2016 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched three clinical trial registries and the references of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. There were no restrictions based on language, date of publication or study setting.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which enrolled S aureus carriers with any type of surgery and assessed the use of nasal decontamination with antiseptic/antibiotic properties were included in the review.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and GRADE assessment.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We located two studies (291 participants) for inclusion in this review. The trials were clinically heterogeneous with differences in duration of follow-up, and nasal decontamination regimens. One study compared mupirocin (2% contained in a base of polyethylene glycol 400 and polyethylene glycol 3350) with a placebo in elective cardiac surgery patients; and one study compared Anerdian (iodine 0.45% to 0.57% (W/V), chlorhexidine acetate 0.09% to 0.11% (W/V)) with no treatment also in cardiac surgery patients. The trials reported limited outcome data on SSI, adverse events and secondary outcomes (e.g. S aureus SSI, mortality). Mupirocin compared with placeboThis study found no clear difference in SSI risk following use of mupirocin compared with placebo (1 trial, 257 participants); risk ratio (RR) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 3.25 based on 18/130 events in the mupirocin group and 11/127 in the control group; low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice due to imprecision). Anerdian compared with no treatmentIt is uncertain whether there is a difference in SSI risk following treatment with Anerdian compared with no treatment (1 trial, 34 participants); RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.08 based on 1/18 events in the Anerdian group and 1/16 in the control group; very low certainty evidence (downgraded twice due to imprecision and once due to risk of bias).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is currently limited rigorous RCT evidence available regarding the clinical effectiveness of nasal decontamination in the prevention of SSI. This limitation is specific to the focused question our review addresses, looking at nasal decontamination as a single intervention in participants undergoing surgery who are known S aureus carriers. We were only able to identify two studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review and one of these was very small and poorly reported. The potential benefits and harms of using decontamination for the prevention of SSI in this group of people remain uncertain."

            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to study the delivery of orthopaedic care via a telemedicine network. This study is a descriptive analysis of orthopaedic teleconsultations done during a 2-year period by three orthopaedic surgeons. Four hundred ten teleconsultations were done during the study period from February 1, 1995, to December 31, 1996. Orthopaedic surgeons engaged in 91 teleconsultations (22% of all teleconsultations). Reasons for orthopaedic teleconsultations were: evaluation and treatment of fracture care (39 cases; 43%); evaluation and treatment of ligamentous injury, joint swelling and infection (32 cases; 35%); postoperative evaluation (16 cases; 18%); and evaluation and treatment of dislocations (four cases; 4%). Sixty-two (68%) of the patients remained in the rural community. Twenty-one (23%) of the orthopaedic teleconsultations were classified as emergent (done immediately). Thirty-five (38%) were urgent (done within 1 to 2 hours of provider request), and 35 (38%) were scheduled. The mean duration of time for teleconsultations was 12.8 minutes. Eighty-seven (96%) of the teleconsultations occurred Monday through Friday. Outcome data were collected on all patients involved in teleconsultations. No adverse patient outcomes occurred. This study suggests telemedicine may be an avenue for the delivery of orthopaedic care to patients residing in areas where orthopaedic specialists are not available."

The aim of this study was to identify the germs involved in SSIs in patients from the Clinical Emergency County Hospital of Craiova (SCJUC) and to assess their resistance to antimicrobials, with comparisons between surgical wards and the intensive care unit (ICU). The biological samples were subjected to classical bacteriological diagnostics. Antibiotic resistance was tested by disc diffusion. We used hierarchical clustering as a method to group the isolates based upon the antibiotic resistance profile. The most prevalent bacterial species isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus; 50.72%), followed by Escherichia coli (E. coli; 17.22%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 10.05%). In addition, at lower percentages, we isolated glucose-non-fermenting, Gram-negative bacteria and other Enterobacteriaceae. The antibiotic resistance varied greatly between species; the most resistant were the non-fermenting Gram‑negative rods. E. coli exhibited lower resistance to third generation cephalosporins, quinolones and carbapenems. By contrast, Klebsiella was resistant to many cephalosporins and penicillins, and to a certain extent to carbapenems due to carbapenemase production. The non-fermenting bacteria were highly resistant to antibiotics, but were generally sensitive to colistin. S. aureus was resistant to ceftriaxone (100%), penicillin (91.36%), amoxicillin/clavulanate (87.50%), amikacin (80.00%) and was sensitive to levofloxacin, doxycycline, gentamycin, tigecycline and teicoplanin. The Enterobacteriaceae resistance was only slightly higher in the ICU, particularly to carbapenems (imipenem, 31.20% in the ICU vs. 14.30% in the surgical wards; risk ratio = 2.182). As regards Staphylococcus species, but for non-fermenting bacteria, even if the median was almost the same, the antibiotic resistance index values were confined to the upper limit in the ICU. The data gathered from this study may help infection control teams to establish effective guidelines for antibiotic therapies in various surgical procedures, in order to minimize the risk of developing SSIs by the efficient application of the anti-infection armamentarium."

            "abstract": "The incidence of infectious diseases in the United States has been increasing since 1980. Re-emergent conditions, multidrug-resistant bacteria, newly identified infections, and bioterrorism have prompted public health surveillance and control initiatives, including the use of telehealth technology. Infectious diseases, such as West Nile Virus, pose a particular threat to rural areas, where access to infectious disease specialists (IDS) is limited. Initial, in-patient IDS consultations are reimbursed by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for in-person and for telehealth services. Follow-up consultation and subsequent care visits are reimbursed when delivered via in-person care, but not reimbursed when delivered via telehealth. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of telehealth technology (interactive videoconferencing) in providing timely, efficient, and prudent infectious disease care for rural patients. We conducted a retrospective, comparative review of medical records (n = 107) from inpatients at a metropolitan hospital (n = 59) in a rural state who received in-person IDS treatment, with records from inpatients at nonmetropolitan, rural, and frontier hospitals (n = 48) in the same state who received telehealth IDS treatment. Outcome measures, including number of days hospitalized, number of days receiving intravenous antibiotic, survival, and transfer to another hospital, were compared for three commonly occurring infectious diseases: neutropenic fever, bacterial pneumonia, or bacterial wound infection. Patients treated via telehealth had fewer days on antibiotics and fewer days hospitalized than patients treated via in-person intervention. Survival rates did not differ significantly between groups, but were lower for telehealth patients. Fewer in-person patients required transfer to hospitals offering a higher level of care. Ninety percent of telehealth patients were able to remain at their local hospital for treatment. Results were statistically significant only for selected outcomes and conditions. IDS treatment for the conditions studied is equally effective when delivered via telehealth as when delivered via in-person methods."

The purpose of this study is to determine access to and, ability to use telemedicine technology in an adult hip preservation patient population, as well as determine associations with patient characteristics. Additionally, we seek to understand patients' perceived benefits, risks and preferences of telemedicine.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed a cross-sectional survey administered on patients scheduled to undergo joint preservation surgery by one of three surgeons at a single academic institution. Both preoperative and postoperative established patients were included and called for a telephone administered survey if a date of surgery was scheduled between October 1, 2019 and March 30, 2020 and were 18 years or older. The survey had seven sections with 45 questions relating to demographics, technology access, videoconferencing capability, confidence using technology, telehealth experiences, perceptions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      101 patients completed the survey (48% response rate, 101/212). Overall, 99% of participants reported using the internet, 94% reporting owning a device capable of videoconferencing, and 86% of patients had participated in a video call in the past year. When asked for their preferred method for a physician visit: 79% ranked in-person as their first choice and 16% ranked a videoconference visit as their first choice. Perceived benefits of telemedicine visits included reduced travel to appointments (97% agree) and reduced cost of attending appointments (69% agree). However, patients were concerned that they would not establish the same patient-physician connection (51% agree) and would not receive the same level of care (38% agree) through telemedicine visits versus in person visits.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The majority of hip preservation patients have access to and are capable of using the technology required for telemedicine visits. However, patients still prefer to have in person visits over concerns that they will not establish the same patient-physician connection and will not receive the same level of care. Telemedicine visits in hip preservation patients may be most attractive to return patients with an established doctor-patient relationship, particularly those with concerns for long distances of travel and associated costs.Level of Evidence: III."

Antibiotic prophylaxis might reduce wound infection incidence after an episiotomy, particularly in situations associated with a higher risk of postpartum perineal infection, such as midline episiotomy, extension of the incision, or in settings where the baseline risk of infection after vaginal birth is high. However, available evidence is unclear concerning the role of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing infections after an episiotomy.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess whether routine antibiotic prophylaxis before or immediately after incision or repair of episiotomy for women with an uncomplicated vaginal birth, compared with either placebo or no antibiotic prophylaxis, prevents maternal infectious morbidities and improves outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 24 July 2017, and screened reference lists of retrieved studies.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We considered randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised trials, and cluster-randomised trials that compared the use of routine antibiotic prophylaxis for incision or repair of an episiotomy for women with otherwise normal vaginal births, compared with either placebo or no antibiotic prophylaxis.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy.

The trial, which was conducted in a public hospital in Brazil, compared oral chloramphenicol 500 mg four times daily for 72 hours after episiotomy repair (N = 34) and no treatment (N = 39). We assessed most of the domains at high risk of bias because women were randomised according to even and odd numbers, allocation concealment was based on protocol number, there was no treatment or placebo administered in the control group, we were unclear about the blinding of outcome assessments, and outcomes were incompletely reported. We considered the other domains to be at low risk of bias. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for very serious design limitations (related to lack of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding) and imprecision of effect estimates (small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals (CI) of effect estimates).We found very low-quality evidence, from one trial of 73 women, that there was no clear indication that prophylactic antibiotics reduced the incidence of episiotomy wound dehiscence with infection (risk ratio (RR) 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.28), or without infection (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.34). No cases of other puerperal infections (e.g. endometritis) were reported in either the antibiotic or control group.The trial did not report on any of the secondary outcomes of interest for this review, including severe maternal infectious morbidity, discomfort or pain at the episiotomy wound site, sexual function postpartum, adverse effects of antibiotics, costs of care, women's satisfaction with care, and individual antimicrobial resistance.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There was insufficient evidence to assess the clinical benefits or harms of routine antibiotic prophylaxis for episiotomy repair after normal birth. The only trial included in this review had several methodological limitations, with very serious limitations in design, and imprecision of effect estimates. In addition, the trial tested an antibiotic with limited application in current clinical practice. There is a need for a careful and rigorous assessment of the comparative benefits and harms of prophylactic antibiotics on infection morbidity after episiotomy, in well-designed randomised controlled trials, using common antibiotics and regimens in current obstetric practice."

Questionnaires regarding the occurrence of an SSI were sent to the same patients and their surgeons. One hundred thirty-two SSIs were documented, of which 84% occurred after hospital discharge and 63% were managed outside the surgical facility. Postdischarge SSIs led to an average of 4.6 additional ambulatory encounters. Patient and surgeon questionnaires had a sensitivity of 28% and 15%, respectively.

The present study was conducted to determine the frequency of surgical wound infections in a day surgery population. We randomly selected during a 6-month period 635 (25%) of 2540 patients undergoing a day surgery procedure in which a skin incision was made. The patients were telephoned 1 month after their procedure by an infection control practitioner. Infection was diagnosed if the patient reported that (1) their physician had made a diagnosis of a wound infection or (2) pus was or had been issuing from the wound. Of the 515 patients contacted, 72% had undergone a clean and 28% a clean-contaminated procedure. Patient risk factors for infection were almost completely absent in our day surgery patients. Twenty-six wound infections were diagnosed, 19 of which were identified by physicians' diagnosis and 7 by patient description, for a rate of 5.05%. Two patients required hospitalization for their infections, and 14 were treated with antibiotics. The clean wound infection rates were 4.62%, less than half the infection rate seen in our patients undergoing inpatient surgery at 1 month follow-up by the same surveillance technique. We conclude that day surgery infection rates are much lower than inpatient surgery infection rates at our facility, probably because of a relative absence of risk factors in the day surgery patients."

Methods: We review our experience with patient-generated health data in surgical site infection, draw parallels with similar work in other domains, and identify principles we have found useful. Results: Health information system implementations require substantial changes in provider workflow. Shared expectations between the patient and the surgical team, an incremental approach to change in clinical processes, and an emphasis on clinical utility all support successful implementation. Conclusions: The data collection and rapid information exchange afforded by monitoring post-operative, post-discharge patients using mobile technologies can support the expectations of both patients and providers and may provide a novel data source for public health surveillance of surgical site infection.

Contact was initiated with the burn unit of a single municipal hospital in Lviv, Ukraine. Patients with burn injuries were screened and selected patients were comanaged over a 3-year period by American and Ukrainian physicians. This comanagement included repeated evaluation both by telemedicine conferencing as well as annual trips with physicians from Boston, Massachusetts, traveling to Ukraine to assess patients in an outreach clinic and perform surgical procedures. In our first trip in 2011 we assessed 22 patients and operated on 5. In 2012, 38 patients were evaluated and 12 had combined surgical intervention. In our 2013 trip, 63 patients were evaluated and we operated on 22 of these patients. Multiple clinical research projects related to burn prevention and improving perioperative care have been initiated, presented at national meetings, and submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. Our outreach program in Lviv, Ukraine, strives to improve overall burn care by a multilayered approach. These elements can serve as a possible template for additional international burn outreach plans as they can be customized for both large and small interventions."

As hospitals took measures to increase their capacity to manage COVID-19 patients, plastic surgeons have also had to modify their routine to continue serving their vital role within the hospital environment. In an effort to reduce exposure to COVID-19 and conserve hospital resources, many plastic surgery programs drastically modified call schedules, restructured inpatient teams, triaged operative cases, and expanded telemedicine encounters. Plastic surgery programs focused on craniofacial procedures were impacted by precautionary preventative protocol and shifts in case load made to protect both the healthcare teams and the patients. At academic centers, plastic surgery trainees of all domains felt the impact of these changes. Recognizing the implications on future craniofacial surgical practice, the pandemic has made, the goal of the authors' study is to measure initial impacts of COVID-19 on plastic surgery trainees using a nationwide survey. The authors' results present the first quantitative analysis of plastic surgery trainees' exposure to COVID-19, deployment to other medical specialties, usage of personal protective equipment, and implementation of telemedicine during the pandemic.

In the months following pandemic onset, telemedicine has become a mainstay in healthcare, trainees have adapted and become integrated in patient care in novel ways, and visits unable to transition to telemedical settings received substantial attention to ensure patient and provider safety.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An institutional review board-approved anonymous, multiple-choice and short-answer, Qualtrics survey regarding plastic surgery resident experiences with COVID-19 exposure. It was sent to all US plastic surgery program directors and program coordinators on April 23, 2020 with the request to distribute the survey to their residents. Residents were given the option to participate in a raffle for a $50 gift card. Outcomes measured included demographics, exposure to COVID-19, availability of resources, and adjustments to residency training practices.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Sixty-nine plastic surgery residents throughout all years of training from 18 states responded. Gender, year of training, and location did not significantly impact these reports.Sixteen percent of residents reported covering a COVID-19 team. Twelve percent reported covering a shift not within their scope of practice. From these reports, residents mostly worked in the intensive care unit (50%) and the emergency department (29%).Half of the residents believe they were exposed to high-risk patients. This was reported in a variety of settings: the emergency department for plastic surgery consults (34%), caring for plastic surgery inpatients (16%), performing trauma reconstruction surgery (16%), cancer reconstruction surgery (12%), elective surgery (6%), and intraoperative consults (6%).Seventy-two percent of residents reported adequate access to personal protective equipment. Equipment type varied by patient exposure. When attending to a non-COVID-19 inpatient, most residents used a standard mask (62%) rather than an N95 mask (21%). N95 masks were generally used in patients with unknown COVID-19 status. Residents reported using eye and face shields when attending to non-COVID-19 ICU patients (17%), patients with unknown COVID-19 status (27%), and in the operating room (34%).Forty percent of residents implemented telemedicine to see patients for new consults, follow-up visits, postop checks, and wound checks. Eighty-five percent of residents report that they would continue to incorporate telemedicine in the future. Most significant reported barrier to using telemedicine is the limited ability to perform a physical examination (33%) followed by limited patient access to telemedicine (21%). Other challenges included poor ease of use for patients or providers, billing questions, and lack of interpersonal connection with patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This study, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the first to quantitatively investigate how plastic surgery residents have been affected by the widespread impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. It reports resident exposure to COVID-19 and their associated concerns, resident access to and perceived adequacy of personal protective equipment, as well as changes to clinical practice."

After pectoralis major muscle flap reconstruction in 32 patients, 25% complained of upper extremity weakness, and 56% complained of chest contour deformity. Delayed septic costochondritis or osteomyelitis occurred in 8%. Despite these unfavorable consequences, 72% and 83% of patients were satisfied with the cosmesis of the operation and the overall result, respectively. Furthermore, after hospital discharge, these patients seem to enjoy satisfactory longevity.

Paradoxically, these are the very patients that, because of their chronic comorbidities, are at greatest risk for COVID-related morbidity and mortality. Disinfected Phaenicia (Lucilia) sericata (Medical Maggots; Monarch Labs, Irvine, California) were applied in a standardised fashion by a home-health nurse with direct monitoring, guidance, and collaboration of the attending surgeon. A family member was able to change the outer dressing daily based on normal wound exudate. The inner maggot debridement therapy (MDT) dressing was changed at 2 days showing dramatic reduction in necrotic tissue, elimination of profound malodor, and no evidence of local or advancing infection. The entire initial telehealth-guided application took approximately 20 minutes. The first telehealth-guided MDT dressing change took 14 minutes. We used an artificial-intelligence-based algorithm to measure changes in wound characteristics. At day 0, 46% of the total surface area was covered in malodorous black, necrotic tissue. The first dressing change saw an elimination in assessed malodor with necrotic tissue constituting 14% of total surface area. The second dressing change at 5 days showed a greater than 99% reduction in necrotic tissue. This manuscript constitutes what we believe to be the first telehealth-guided MDT conducted during a resource-limited peri-pandemic period. We believe that MDT, which is an extension of efforts regularly performed in clinic and hospital, may have the potential to reduce resource usage while potentially improving care and quality of life for people with limb and life-threatening complications of diabetes and other chronic diseases."

At Salisbury Foundation Trust (SFT), during phase one of the NHS response to Covid-19, the decision to treat upper limb trauma patients in-person or remotely was made using clinical screening criteria. For many patients, audio-visual appointments offered a practical, time efficient way of accessing their reconstructive team for assessment, advice and post-operative care. However, a subset of patients was identified by the team as requiring at least one in-person consultation to minimize perceived clinical risk and to optimize quality outcomes. In order to understand more fully the challenges and successes of technology-enabled care to date, a national survey of practice across hand units in the UK was conducted. We present here some of our key findings and propose the need to develop nationally agreed screening criteria to determine how and when technology enabled outpatient care can be used in the management of acute upper limb trauma. The results of this survey forms part of a series of projects currently underway looking at the efficacy of audio-visual care in upper limb trauma, including a multicentre observational study."

Finally, the panel had consensus that video visits could be appropriate for a variety of visit types including early, midterm, longer term postoperative follow-up, follow-up for imaging review, and follow-up after an intervention (i.e., physical therapy, injection).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Although telemedicine was initially introduced out of necessity, this technology most likely will remain due to evidence of high patient satisfaction and significant cost savings. This study was able to provide a framework for appropriate telemedicine utilization in spine surgery from a panel of experts. However, several questions remain for future research, such as whether or not an in-person consultation is necessary prior to surgery and which physical exam maneuvers are appropriate for telemedicine.Level of Evidence: 4."

We determined the population attributable fraction (PAF) to quantify the contribution of each major complication towards adverse outcomes. PAF represents the burden of adverse outcomes that could be eliminated if the corresponding complication was prevented.

The rates of increased resource utilization were as follows; prolonged hospitalization in 23.7%, non-home discharge in 10.7% and unplanned readmission in 14.8% of women. AL was the largest contributor to prolonged hospitalizations [PAF = 75.7% (95%CI: 51.4%-90.0%)] and readmissions [PAF = 17.1% (95%CI: 11.5%-22.6%)]; while transfusion was the largest contributor to non-home discharge [PAF = 22.8% (95%CI: 0.7%-42.4%)].

Increased adoption of telemedicine has emerged as an alternative to in-person contact for patient-physician interactions. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of telemedicine on workflow and care delivery from January 2019 to December 2021 in a neurosurgical department at a quaternary care center.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Prospectively captured data on clinic appointment utilization, duration, and outcomes were queried. Visits were divided into in-person visits and telemedicine appointments, categorized as follow-up visits of previously surgically treated patients, internal consultations, new patient visits, and early postoperative returns after surgery. Appointment volume was compared pre- and postpandemic using March 2020 as the pandemic onset. Clinical efficiency was measured by time to appointment, rate of on-time appointments, proportion of appointments resulting in surgical intervention (surgical yield), and patient-reported satisfaction, the latter measured as the proportion of patients indicating \"high likelihood to recommend practice.\"\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 54,562 visits occurred, most commonly for follow-up for previously operated patients (51.8%), internal new patient referrals (24.5%), and external new patient referrals (19.8%). Total visit volume was stable pre- to postpandemic (1521.3 vs 1512, p = 0.917). However, in-person visits significantly decreased (1517/month vs 1220/month, p < 0.001), with a nadir in April 2020, while telemedicine appointment utilization increased significantly (0.3% vs 19.1% of all visits). Telemedicine utilization remained stable throughout the 1st calendar year following the pandemic. Telemedicine appointments were associated with shorter time to appointment than in-person visits both before and after the pandemic onset (0-5 days from appointment request: 60% vs 33% vs 29.8%, p < 0.001). Patients had on-time appointments in 87% of telemedicine encounters. Notably, telemedicine appointments resulted in surgery in 31.8% of internal consultations or new patient visits, a significantly lower rate than that for in-person visits (51.8%). After the widespread integration of telemedicine, patient satisfaction for all visits was higher than before the pandemic onset (85.9% vs 88.5%, p = 0.027).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Telemedicine use significantly increased following the pandemic onset, compensating for observed decreases in face-to-face visits. Utilization rates have remained stable, suggesting effective integration, and delays between referrals and appointments were lower than for in-person visits. Importantly, telemedicine integration was not associated with a decrease in overall patient satisfaction, although telemedicine appointments had a lower surgical yield. These data suggest that telemedicine smoothened the impact of the pandemic on clinical workflow and helped to maintain continuity and quality of outpatient care."

Recent studies suggest that pre-biopsy screening for fluoroquinolone-resistant (FQ-R) pathogens may be useful in reducing post-biopsy infections. We sought to determine the baseline prevalence of fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance in rectal flora and to investigate the relationship between pre-biopsy carriage of FQ-R pathogens and the risk of post-TRUSPB infection. Electronic databases were searched for related literature. Studies were assessed for methodological quality and comparable outcomes prior to meta-analysis (using quality- and random-effects models). Nine studies, representing 2541 patients, were included. The prevalence of FQ resistance was higher (20.4%, 95% CI 18.2-22.6%) in rectal cultures obtained following FQ-based prophylaxis compared with those obtained before (12.8%, 95% CI 10.7-15.0%). Overall infection rates in patients using empirical prophylaxis were higher (3.3%, 95% CI 2.6-4.2%) than in those using altered (targeted/protocol) regimens (0.3%, 95% CI 0-0.9%). Higher infection rates were seen in men with FQ-R rectal cultures (7.1%, 95% CI 4.0-10.5%) than in those with FQ-sensitive (FQ-S) rectal cultures (1.1%, 95% CI 0.5-1.8%). For every 14 men with FQ-R rectal cultures, one additional infection was observed compared with men with FQ-S rectal cultures. Prior FQ use and prior genitourinary infection were significant risk factors for FQ-R colonisation. FQ resistance in rectal flora is a significant predictor of post-TRUSPB infection and may require re-assessment of empirical antimicrobial prophylaxis methods. Altered prophylaxis based on rectal culturing prior to TRUSPB may reduce morbidity and potentially provide economic benefits to health services."

Here, the low population density, the low educational and income level as well as an aging population have to be mentioned. Faced with the task of ensuring equal access to healthcare for all its inhabitants, the regional health authorities created the telemedicine program. From 1998 until 2000, the program developed in an experimental fashion, with teleconsultations involving a number of providers: primary health care centers, regional hospitals, and central hospitals. Between 2000 and 2010, there were a total of 135,000 telemedicine acts including teleconsultations, teleradiology (computerised tomography and x-rays), ultrasound telemedicine and telepathology. Presently, the network comprises 20 health centers and 6 hospitals, covering 4 districts. The platform is composed of high resolution videoconferencing equipment, software with patients' clinical records, an image archive, and a number of peripherals, such as electronic dermatoscopes and phonendoscopes. Teleconsultations are provided by fifteen medical specialties, across 3 district hospitals, ranging from neurology to pediatric surgery. In 2008, health authorities started the telelearning program, initially using point to point videoconferencing, and by the end of 2010, 848 healthcare professionals, across 52 locations, had participated in remote learning sessions, covering topics from chronic wound treatment, to infection control, to medical error. As of 2011, point to multipoint telelearning is also in operation. This paper provides an overview of the telemedicine program in Alentejo, including both infrastructure and operations. Preliminary results of an ongoing evaluation of the impact of teleconsultations on key indicators of the regional healthcare system are also presented (including current utilization and plans for future expansion). This article builds on the experience acquired throughout a decade of using telemedicine on an everyday basis, in a context of remarkable challenges in the delivery of accessible, equitable and quality healthcare services."

            "title": "Obesity in Neurosurgery: A Narrative Review of the Literature.",
            "abstract": "Obesity is an important consideration in neurosurgical practice. Of Australian adults, 28.3% are obese and it is estimated that more than two thirds of Australia's population will be overweight or obese by 2025. This review of the effects of obesity on neurosurgical procedures shows that, in patients undergoing spinal surgery, an increased body mass index is a significant risk factor for surgical site infection, venous thromboembolism, major medical complications, prolonged length of surgery, and increased financial cost. Although outcome scores and levels of patient satisfaction are generally lower after spinal surgery in obese patients, obesity is not a barrier to deriving benefit from surgery and, when the natural history of conservative management is taken into account, the long-term benefits of surgery may be equivalent or even greater in obese patients than in nonobese patients. In cranial surgery, the impact of obesity on outcome and complication rates is generally lower. Specific exceptions are higher rates of distal catheter migration after shunt surgery and cerebrospinal fluid leak after posterior fossa surgery. Minimally invasive approaches show promise in mitigating some of the adverse effects of obesity in patients undergoing spine surgery but further studies are needed to develop strategies to reduce obesity-related surgical complications."

Honey has been used since ancient times as a remedy in wound care. Evidence from animal studies and some trials has suggested that honey may accelerate wound healing.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The objective was to determine whether honey increases the rate of healing in acute wounds (e.g. burns, lacerations) and chronic wounds (e.g. skin ulcers, infected surgical wounds).\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      For this first update of the review we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 13 June 2012); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE (2008 to May Week 5 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 12 June 2012); Ovid EMBASE (2008 to 2012 Week 23); and EBSCO CINAHL (2008 to 8 June 2012).\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that evaluated honey as a treatment for any sort of acute or chronic wound were sought. There was no restriction in terms of source, date of publication or language. Wound healing was the primary endpoint.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Data from eligible trials were extracted and summarised by one review author, using a data extraction sheet, and independently verified by a second review author.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 25 trials (with a total of 2987 participants) that met the inclusion criteria, including six new trials that were added to this update. In acute wounds, three trials evaluated the effect of honey in acute lacerations, abrasions or minor surgical wounds and 12 trials evaluated the effect of honey in burns. In chronic wounds, two trials evaluated the effect of honey in venous leg ulcers, and single trials investigated its effect in infected post-operative wounds, pressure injuries, cutaneous Lieshmaniasis, diabetic foot ulcers and Fournier's gangrene. Three trials recruited people into mixed groups of chronic or acute wounds. Most trials were at high or unclear risk of bias. In acute wounds, specifically partial-thickness burns, honey might reduce time to healing compared with some conventional dressings (WMD -4.68 days, 95%CI -4.28 to -5.09 days), but, when compared with early excision and grafting, honey delays healing in partial- and full-thickness burns (WMD 13.6 days, 95% CI 10.02 to 17.18 days). In chronic wounds, honey does not significantly increase healing in venous leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.38), and may delay healing in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used as an adjuvant to meglumine antimoniate compared to meglumine antimoniate alone (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Honey dressings do not increase rates of healing significantly in venous leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression. Honey may delay healing in partial- and full-thickness burns in comparison to early excision and grafting, and in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used as an adjuvant with meglumine antimoniate. Honey might be superior to some conventional dressing materials, but there is considerable uncertainty about the replicability and applicability of this evidence. There is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice in other types of wounds, and purchasers should refrain from providing honey dressings for routine use until sufficient evidence of effect is available."

            "abstract": "Optimizing antibiotic prescribing across the surgical pathway (before, during, and after surgery) is a key aspect of tackling important drivers of antimicrobial resistance and simultaneously decreasing the burden of infection at the global level. In the UK alone, 10 million patients undergo surgery every year, which is equivalent to 60% of the annual hospital admissions having a surgical intervention. The overwhelming majority of surgical procedures require effectively limited delivery of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infections. Evidence from around the world indicates that antibiotics for surgical prophylaxis are administered ineffectively, or are extended for an inappropriate duration of time postoperatively. Ineffective antibiotic prophylaxis can contribute to the development of surgical site infections (SSIs), which represent a significant global burden of disease. The World Health Organization estimates SSI rates of up to 50% in postoperative surgical patients (depending on the type of surgery), with a particular problem in low- and middle-income countries, where SSIs are the most frequently reported healthcare-associated infections. Across European hospitals, SSIs alone comprise 19.6% of all healthcare-acquired infections. Much of the scientific research in infection management in surgery is related to infection prevention and control in the operating room, surgical prophylaxis, and the management of SSIs, with many studies focusing on infection within the 30-day postoperative period. However it is important to note that SSIs represent only one of the many types of infection that can occur postoperatively. This article provides an overview of the surgical pathway and considers infection management and antibiotic prescribing at each step of the pathway. The aim was to identify the implications for research and opportunities for system improvement."

            "abstract": "This study describes a novel approach to solve the surgical site infection (SSI) classification problem. Feature engineering has traditionally been one of the most important steps in solving complex classification problems, especially in cases with temporal data. The described novel approach is based on abstraction of temporal data recorded in three temporal windows. Maximum likelihood L1-norm (lasso) regularization was used in penalized logistic regression to predict the onset of surgical site infection occurrence based on available patient blood testing results up to the day of surgery. Prior knowledge of predictors (blood tests) was integrated in the modelling by introduction of penalty factors depending on blood test prices and an early stopping parameter limiting the maximum number of selected features used in predictive modelling. Finally, solutions resulting in higher interpretability and cost-effectiveness were demonstrated. Using repeated holdout cross-validation, the baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) classifier achieved a mean AUC of 0.801, whereas our best full lasso model achieved a mean AUC of 0.956. Best model testing results were achieved for full lasso model with maximum number of features limited at 20 features with an AUC of 0.967. Presented models showed the potential to not only support domain experts in their decision making but could also prove invaluable for improvement in prediction of SSI occurrence, which may even help setting new guidelines in the field of preoperative SSI prevention and surveillance."

National healthcare services have to manage unexpected shortage of healthcare resources that have to be reallocated according to the principles of fair and ethical prioritisation, in order to maintain the highest levels of care to all patients, ensure the safety of patients and healthcare workers and save as many lives as possible. Beyond that, cancer care services have to pursue restructuring, following the same evidence-based dispositions. In this article, we propose guidance to the management of colorectal cancer during the pandemic, prioritised according to a three-tiered framework, based on expert clinical judgement and magnitude of benefit expected from specific interventions. Since the availability of resources for diagnostic procedures, surgery and postoperative care, systemic therapy and radiotherapy may differ, authors did separate prioritisation analyses. The impact of postponing or abrogating cancer interventions on outcomes according to a high, medium or low priority scale, is outlined and discussed. The implementation of healthcare services using telemedicine is explored: it reveals itself as functional and effective for limiting patients' need to travel to centres and thereby has the potential to reduce diffusion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Colorectal cancer demands a considerable amount of medical resources. Therefore, the redefinition of its diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms with a rigorous method is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality of continuum of care in the broader context of the pandemic and the challenged healthcare systems."

            "abstract": "A surgical helmet system (SHS) is either a loose-fitting hood or a hood combined with an integral gown (called a toga system). SHSs are used during orthopedic procedures to decrease the patient's risk of deep wound infection by keeping skin and other particles from the surgeon's face from falling into the open surgical site. They are also used to protect surgical staff from infectious blood splashes and potentially infectious aerosols generated by power tools during orthopedic procedures - and it is this aspect of SHS use that has attracted particular attention, given the intensified interest in healthcare worker (HCW) protection (e.g., against human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], tuberculosis [TB], and hepatitis C virus [HCV]) in hospitals today. Ironically, the very factors that have led to SHSs' recent popularity may limit the need for their use, inasmuch as facilities have instituted so many other effective infection control methods against bloodborne and airborne pathogens. Although SHSs do provide splash protection against bloodborne pathogens, institutions may already by adequately protecting their staff against this hazard. In addition, they may be using SHSs to provide other types of patient and HCW protection that are already being provided by existing infection control measures. SHSs are available in a wide variety of configurations. We evaluated a total of six SHSs: one hood and one toga system each from three manufacturers. The units we tested were among each manufacturer's bestselling systems. We examined how well they would protect patients against deep wound infections and HCWs against splashes and aerosolized particles. We also evaluated their comfort and ease of use for wearers. We found that all of the SHSs provided sufficient patient protection against particles shed by the surgeon. We also found that the hood-only units and the hood components of the toga units provided sufficient HCW splash protection. (The gown portion of the toga systems failed our fluid-resistance criterion. However, we did not test the separate surgical gowns that are used with the hood-only units, and we do not know if they provide any greater level of protection than the toga fabric does). We rated all hood-only units Acceptable. We rated all toga units Acceptable-Not Recommended because the level of patient and HCW protection provided by the toga systems did not justify their significantly higher cost. We did find differences in the level of HCW respiratory protection these systems provided against aerosols. However, we do not believe that this should be a significant selection consideration because there is no established need for respiratory protection during orthopedic procedures. (Respiratory protection is needed against TB aerosols, but hip and knee arthroplasty procedures are usually elective and would be delayed on any active or suspected TB patient until the patient is noninfectious). To establish the context for this study, we first present a Guidance Section, \"Do You Need Surgical Helmet Systems for Orthopedic Procedures?\" In this section, we discuss the infection risks present during orthopedic procedures. We also outline the protective measures that institutions may already have in place to reduce these risks. We then discuss how SHSs fit into the infection control picture. Supplementary material in this section includes a discussion of the respiratory protection needed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a table of factors affecting the choice among SHSs, respirator masks, and surgical masks for patient and HCW protection. Ultimately, the choice to use SHSs may be dictated by the training and preference of the surgical staff.

Postoperative empyema (PE) is a rare but potentially fatal complication of pulmonary resections and proper management is essential. Appropriate antibiotics and surgical treatment is necessary to cure the PE. PE is often associated with bronchopleural fistula, which makes the management of PE difficult. The treatment of empyema has the basic way of thinking, but there are various cures, closed tube thoracostomy, video-assisted thoracoscopy, emergency open window thoracostomy, and Endoscopic conservative treatment may necessary."

            "abstract": "## IMPORTANCE\nFollowing surgery to treat major trauma-related fractures, deep wound infection rates are high. It is not known if negative pressure wound therapy can reduce infection rates in this setting.\n## OBJECTIVE\nTo assess outcomes in patients who have incisions resulting from surgery for lower limb fractures related to major trauma and were treated with either incisional negative pressure wound therapy or standard wound dressing.\n## DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nA randomized clinical trial conducted at 24 trauma hospitals representing the UK Major Trauma Network that included 1548 patients aged 16 years or older who underwent surgery for a lower limb fracture caused by major trauma from July 7, 2016, through April 17, 2018, with follow-up to December 11, 2018.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nIncisional negative pressure wound therapy (n = 785), which involved a specialized dressing used to create negative pressure over the wound, vs standard wound dressing not involving negative pressure (n = 763).\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome measure was deep surgical site infection at 30 days diagnosed according to the criteria from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A preplanned secondary analysis of the primary outcome was performed at 90 days. The secondary outcomes were patient-reported disability (Disability Rating Index), health-related quality of life (EuroQol 5-level EQ-5D), surgical scar assessment (Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale), and chronic pain (Douleur Neuropathique Questionnaire) at 3 and 6 months, as well as other local wound healing complications at 30 days.\n## RESULTS\nAmong 1548 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 49.8 [20.3] years; 561 [36%] were aged ≤40 years; 583 [38%] women; and 881 [57%] had multiple injuries), 1519 (98%) had data available for the primary outcome. At 30 days, deep surgical site infection occurred in 5.84% (45 of 770 patients) of the incisional negative pressure wound therapy group and in 6.68% (50 of 749 patients) of the standard wound dressing group (odds ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.57 to 1.33]; absolute risk difference, -0.77% [95% CI, -3.19% to 1.66%]; P = .52). There was no significant difference in the deep surgical site infection rate at 90 days (11.4% [72 of 629 patients] in the incisional negative pressure wound therapy group vs 13.2% [78 of 590 patients] in the standard wound dressing group; odds ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.59 to 1.19]; absolute risk difference, -1.76% [95% CI, -5.41% to 1.90%]; P = .32). For the 5 prespecified secondary outcomes reported, there were no significant differences at any time point.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAmong patients who underwent surgery for major trauma-related lower limb fractures, use of incisional negative pressure wound therapy, compared with standard wound dressing, resulted in no significant difference in the rate of deep surgical site infection. The findings do not support the use of incisional negative pressure wound therapy in this setting, although the event rate at 30 days was lower than expected.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nisrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN12702354.\n"

The reporting of wound classification in patients undergoing hepato-pancreatico-biliary (HPB) surgery and the impact of inconsistencies on quality metrics were investigated.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The 2005-2011 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) participant use file was interrogated to identify patients undergoing HPB resections. The effect of wound classification on post-operative surgical site infection (SSI) rates was determined through logistic regression. The impact of variations in wound classification reporting on perceived outcomes was modelled by simulating observed-to-expected (O/E) ratios for SSI.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 27,376 patients were identified with significant heterogeneity in wound classification. In spite of clear guidelines prompting at least 'clean-contaminated' designation for HPB resections, 8% of all cases were coded as 'clean'. Contaminated [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.39, P = 0.001] and dirty (AOR: 1.42, P = 0.02] cases were associated with higher odds of SSI, whereas clean-contaminated were not (P = 0.99).

            "abstract": "Implant-associated surgical-site infections can have significant clinical consequences. Previously we reported a method for prophylactically disinfecting implant surfaces in surgical pockets, where an antibiotic solution containing minocycline (M) and rifampin (R) was applied as a solid film in a crosslinked biopolymer matrix that partially liquefied in situ to provide extended prophylaxis. Here we studied the effect of adding sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate (MeSNA) on durability of prophylaxis in an in vitro model of implant-associated surgical-site infection. Adding MeSNA to the M/R biopolymer, antimicrobial film extended the duration for which biofilm formation by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA) was prevented on silicone surfaces in the model. M/R films with and without MeSNA were effective in preventing colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Independent experiments revealed that MeSNA directly inhibited proteolytic digestion of the biopolymer film and synergistically enhanced antimicrobial potency of M/R against MDR-PA. Incubation of the MeSNA containing films with L929 fibroblasts revealed no impairment of cellular metabolic activity or viability."

We evaluated the impact of a six-year surveillance system based on data from INCISO, a network of volunteer surgical wards from hospitals in Northern France. Each year surgical patients were enrolled consecutively and surveyed during their in- and out-hospital stay until 30 days following surgery. A standardised form was completed for each patient including SSI diagnosis according to standard criteria and several risk factors such as wound class, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, operation duration, elective/emergency, videoscopy and type of surgery. A dashboard was displayed at the end of each annual survey, so that participants could compare with other surgery adjusted for National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance system (NNIS) risk index and standardised incidence ratio (SIR). Over the six years, 3661 SSI were identified in 150 440 surgical patients (crude incidence: 2.4%) from 548 surgery wards. The crude SSI incidence decreased from 3.8 to 1.7% (P for trend <0.0001, relative reduction: -55%) and the NNIS-0 adjusted SSI incidence from 2.0 to 1% (P for trend <0.0001; relative reduction: -50%). An active surveillance system striving for benchmark through a network is an effective strategy to reduce SSI incidence.

Novel dressings, designed specifically for postoperative wounds, can help to reduce the risk of SSI and other complications such as blistering. This study compared the use of a new polyurethane film surgical dressing (Opsite Post-Op Visible, Smith & Nephew, Hull, UK) with gauze and tape in the management of postoperative wounds. The results show that the polyurethane film dressing results in a significant reduction in SSI (1·4% versus 6·6%, P = 0·006) as well as a reduction in other postoperative wound complications (e.g. blistering and erythema). Economic analysis conducted alongside the study suggests that these improved outcomes can be achieved at a lower treatment cost than gauze and tape dressings.

The safety profile of this device was investigated by testing air quality using 0.5- and 5-µm particle counts as well as airborne bacterial counts on an operating table simulating a wound in a thoracic operation in a busy theatre environment. Particle and bacterial counts were obtained with both an empty and full theatre, with and without the 'bladeless fan'. The use of the 'bladeless fan' within the operating theatre during the simulated operation led to a minor, not statistically significant, lowering of both the particle and bacterial counts. In conclusion, the 'bladeless fan' is a safe, effective, low-cost and low-energy consumption solution for personnel cooling in a theatre environment that maintains the clean room conditions of the operating theatre."

We observed no significant difference in pulmonary complications between those that had a rigid versus flexible chest wall reconstruction (p = 0.401; OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.83-2.43). The odds of pulmonary complications increased with each additional resected rib (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.2-1.71). Multivariable analysis identified the number of resected ribs (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.00-1.59) and concomitant lobectomy (OR, 3.59; 95% CI, 1.62-7.92) as variables associated with perioperative pulmonary morbidity.

Patients were then categorised according to the World Health Organisation obesity classification. Demographics, comorbidities, and perioperative risk factors were identified among the NSQIP variables. Data was then analysed for surgical complications, wound complications, and medical complications within 30 days of surgery. In total, 4545 patients were identified; 54.4% of patients were obese (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)), of which 1308 (28.8%) were Class I (BMI = 30-34.9 kg/m(2)), 686 (15.1%) were Class II (BMI = 35-39.9 kg/m(2)), and 439 (9.7%) were Class III (BMI > 40 kg/m(2)). The presence of comorbid conditions increased across obesity classifications (p < 0.001), with significant differences noted in all cohort comparisons except when comparing class I to class II (p = 0.12). Early complications were rare (6.1%), with superficial skin and soft tissue infections accounting for 45.8% of complications. Examining any complication, a significant increase was noted with increasing obesity class (p < 0.001). This was further isolated when comparing morbidly obese patients to non-obese (p < 0.001), class I (p < 0.001), and class II (p = 0.01) patients. This population-wide analysis - the largest and most heterogeneous study to date - has demonstrated that increasing obesity class is associated with increased early postoperative complications. Morbidly obese patients are at the highest risk, with complications occurring in nearly 12% of this cohort."

            "abstract": "Cost-effectiveness analysis is primarily a decision-making aid for budget holders. The first questions that must be answered are: Costs to whom? Effects on whom? Ideally cost-effectiveness analysis should address these questions separately from the perspective of the hospital, the community health services, the patient, and society in general. However, it may not always be practical to perform such a wide-ranging study. Moreover, if the decision maker is primarily concerned with the hospital budget, it is tempting to confine the detailed analysis to items that affect that budget. A good analysis should acknowledge these inevitable limitations and explicitly state whose perspective is being used. Even if a detailed study of community health services is not possible, the analysis should include some evidence about the likely impact of the program on others outside the immediate sphere of the budget holder. Two situations commonly arise in applying cost-effectiveness analysis to surgical prophylaxis: (a) The prophylaxis is more expensive than current practice and its costs must be justified, e.g., the use of a more expensive drug for a recognized indication or the introduction of prophylaxis for a new indication. (b) The prophylaxis is cheaper than current practice and must be shown to be as cost-effective, e.g., the use of a single-dose prophylaxis instead of multiple-dose regimens or the administration of an oral dose instead of an intravenous dose. We believe that cost-effectiveness analysis adds a useful extra dimension to the evaluation of surgical prophylaxis."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Inguinal or femoral hernia is a tissue protrusion in the groin region and has a cumulative incidence of 27% in adult men and of 3% in adult women. As most hernias become symptomatic over time, groin hernia repair is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures worldwide. This type of surgery is considered 'clean' surgery with wound infection rates expected to be lower than 5%. For clean surgical procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis is not generally recommended. However after the introduction of mesh-based hernia repair and the publication of studies that have high wound infection rates the debate as to whether antibiotic prophylaxis is required to prevent postoperative wound infections started again.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing postoperative (superficial and deep) wound infections in elective open inguinal and femoral hernia repair.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched several electronic databases: Cochrane Registry of Studies Online, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Scopus and Science Citation Index (search performed on 12 November 2019). We also searched two trial registers and the reference list of included studies.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials comparing any type of antibiotic prophylaxis versus placebo or no treatment for preventing postoperative wound infections in adults undergoing inguinal or femoral open hernia repair surgery (tissue repair and mesh repair).\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We separately analysed results for two different surgical methods (herniorrhaphy and hernioplasty). Several studies revealed infection rates that were higher than the expected 5% for clean surgery and we therefore divided studies into two subgroups: high infection risk environments (≥ 5% infection rate); and low infection risk environments (< 5% infection rate). We performed meta-analyses with random-effects models. We analysed three outcomes: superficial surgical site infections (SSSI); deep surgical site infections (DSSI); and all postoperative wound infections (SSSI + DSSI).\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      In this review update we identified and included 10 new studies. In total, we included 27 studies with 8308 participants in this review. It is uncertain whether antibiotic prophylaxis as compared to placebo (or no treatment) prevents all types of postoperative wound infections after herniorrhaphy surgery (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 1.33; 5 studies, 1865 participants; very low quality evidence). Subgroup analysis did not change these results. We could not perform meta-analyses for SSSI or DSSI as these outcomes were not reported separately. Twenty-two studies related to hernioplasty surgery (total of 6443 participants) and we analysed three outcomes: SSSI; DSSI; SSSI + DSSI. Within the low infection risk environment subgroup, antibiotic prophylaxis as compared to placebo probably makes little or no difference for the outcomes 'prevention of all wound infections' (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.14; moderate-quality evidence) and 'prevention of SSSI' (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.17, moderate-quality evidence). Within the high infection risk environment subgroup it is uncertain whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduces all types of wound infections (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77, very low quality evidence) or SSSI (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.77, very low quality evidence). When combining participants from both subgroups, antibiotic prophylaxis as compared to placebo probably reduces the risk of all types of wound infections (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.78) and SSSI (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78; moderate-quality evidence). Antibiotic prophylaxis as compared to placebo probably makes little or no difference in reducing the risk of postoperative DSSI (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.65; moderate-quality evidence), both in a low infection risk environment (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11 to 4.13; moderate-quality evidence) and in the high infection risk environment (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.89; low-quality evidence).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Evidence of very low quality shows that it is uncertain whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the risk of postoperative wound infections after herniorrhaphy surgery. Evidence of moderate quality shows that antibiotic prophylaxis probably makes little or no difference in preventing wound infections (i.e. all wound infections, SSSI or DSSI) after hernioplasty surgery in a low infection risk environment. Evidence of low quality shows that antibiotic prophylaxis in a high-risk environment may reduce the risk of all wound infections and SSSI, while evidence of very low quality shows that it is uncertain whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduces DSSI after hernioplasty surgery."

The bundle consisted of four elements: antibiotic prophylaxis according to local guidelines, no hair removal, normothermia and 'hygiene discipline' in the operating room (i.e. number of door movements). Dutch hospitals were advised to implement the bundle and to measure the outcome. This study's goal was to assess how effective the bundle was in reducing SSI risk.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Hospitals assessed whether their staff complied with each of the bundle elements and voluntary reported compliance data to the national SSI surveillance network (PREZIES). From PREZIES data, we selected data from 2009 to 2014 relating to 13 types of surgical procedures. We excluded surgeries with missing (non)compliance data, and calculated for each remaining surgery with reported (non)compliance data the level of compliance with the bundle (that is, being compliant with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 of the elements). Subsequently, we used this level of compliance to assess the effect of bundle compliance on the SSI risk, using multilevel logistic regression techniques.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      217 489 surgeries were included, of which 62 486 surgeries (29%) had complete bundle reporting. Within this group, the SSI risk was significantly lower for surgeries with complete bundle compliance compared to surgeries with lower compliance levels. Odds ratios ranged from 0.63 to 0.86 (risk reduction of 14% to 37%), while a 13% risk reduction was demonstrated for each point increase in compliance-level. Sensitivity analysis indicated that due to analysing reported bundles only, we probably underestimated the total effect of implementing the bundle.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study demonstrated that adhering to a surgical care bundle significantly reduced the risk of SSIs.

However, SSI is not uncommon, occurring in 1 in 13 patients. Although the majority of patients experience complete symptom resolution, a significant proportion do not. In our experience, routine outpatient follow-up is not required. Nevertheless, the lack of formal follow-up may prove a missed learning opportunity, potentially resulting in inappropriate patient selection for surgery."

            "abstract": "A global outbreak of invasive Mycobacterium chimaera infections has been associated with exposure to certain heater-cooler devices (HCDs) used during cardiopulmonary bypass. Outbreak investigations have shown that these HCDs harbor M. chimaera in water circuits and generate bio-aerosols in the operating room, leading to airborne transmission to patients during surgery. Whole genome sequencing data support a common-source outbreak originating at an HCD manufacturing facility. Most clinical infections are associated with implanted devices, diagnosis is often delayed, and treatment requires device removal and prolonged antibiotic therapy. Because it is nearly impossible to eradicate M. chimaera from HCDs using existing disinfection approaches, strict separation of HCD exhaust from operating room air is necessary to prevent patient exposure. Lessons learned from this outbreak include: 1) medical device risks are difficult to predict, requiring improved expert review before approval, and 2) advances in genomics provide powerful tools for outbreak investigation and public health surveillance."

            "abstract": "Total hip or knee arthroplasty is a highly effective intervention for treating the symptoms of degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis (OA), often an unwelcome consequence of obesity. A safe and common surgical procedure, hip and knee arthroplasty procedures are not immune to the occurrence of postoperative complications such as surgical site infection (SSI) or surgical wound dehiscence (SWD). While published rates of SSI following hip or knee arthroplasty are low, 1% to 2% in some cases, it is the resulting wound complication and its clinical management and the impact on patient well-being and return to daily life for the 1% to 2% that is of concern. Postoperative complications such as SSI are a major cost driver to the health care system following arthroplasty and often result in extended lengths of stay, readmission for further surgery, primary and community nursing visits, and are a costly burden to health care settings. Early identification of a wound complication through post-discharge surveillance using a fully transparent dressing and smartphone technology and patient education may ameliorate contributing factors or reduce the likelihood of a complication occurring in the first instance. This clinical trial is a non-randomised pragmatic convenience sample carried out in 200 participants of both sexes receiving either a TKA or THA. There will be equal allocation to two groups (100 hips and 100 knees), with 50 in each allocation receiving the interventional dressing and 50 as control. The dressing will be applied prior to discharge and participants will be provided with education on postoperative wound care, when to contact home care nursing for a potential wound problem, and use of their smartphone to capture and send images of their incision site to the study nurses. Participants will also be followed up by home care nursing services at day 14 for suture removal and wound assessment. Participants will complete a patient-reported outcomes survey on day 14 and followed up on day 30 after surgery for wound assessment. The results of this trial may provide a novel pathway using a fully transparent dressing and digital technologies for the prevention of acute readmissions because of wound complications through early detection and intervention."

The infections that develop after surgery are a major problem throughout the world leading to, increased morbidity and mortality. This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of bacterial pathogens causing wound infection in the surgical wards and to determine the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the isolated bacteria. A total of 250 wound samples were collected over a period of 6 months from July-December, 2016. The pathogenic bacteria were isolated, identified and their antibiotic susceptibility was determined through disc diffusion method. Among 250 cases, 210 (84%) were culture positive for bacterial pathogens, while 40 (16%) were bacteriologically sterile (Negative). Rate of infection was high in males (55.6%) than females (44.4%). The predominant isolates were E.coli 55 (26.19%), followed by S.aureus 51 (24.28%), Pseudomonas spp. 43(20.47%), S.aureus MRSA 21 (10%), Proteus Marbillis 15 (7.14%), E.coli ESBL producer was 8 (3.81%), Acinetobacter 7 (3.33%) Proteus valgaris 5 (2.38%), b-Streptococci 3 (1.43%) and Klebsella pneumonia were the least, 2 (0.95%). Linezolid, Vancomycin, Amoxycillin, Cefoperazone and Meropenem are the most effective antibiotics for treating post-surgical wound infections."

            "abstract": "Surgical-site infections (SSIs) account for 20% of all healthcare-associated infections, are the most common nosocomial infection among surgical patients, and are a focus of quality improvement initiatives. Despite implementation of many quality care measures (e.g. prophylactic antibiotics), SSIs remain a significant cause of morbidity, mortality, and economic burden, particularly in the field of neurosurgery. Topical vancomycin is increasingly utilized in instrumented spinal and cardiothoracic procedures, where it has been shown to reduce the risk of SSIs. However, a randomized controlled trial assessing its efficacy in the general neurosurgical population has yet to be done. The principle aim of \"Topical Vancomycin for Neurosurgery Wound Prophylaxis\" (NCT02284126) is to determine whether prophylactic, topical vancomycin reduces the risk of SSIs in the adult neurosurgical population. This prospective, multicenter, patient-blinded, randomized controlled trial will enroll patients to receive the standard of care plus topical vancomycin, or the standard of care alone. The primary endpoint of this study is a SSI by postoperative day (POD) 30. Patients must be over 18years of age. Patients are excluded for renal insufficiency, vancomycin allergy, and some ineligible procedures. Univariate analysis and logistic regression will determine the effect of topical vancomycin on SSIs at 30days. A randomized controlled trial is needed to determine the efficacy of this treatment. Results of this trial are expected to directly influence the standard of care and prevention of SSIs in neurosurgical patients."

The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review of the literature on those treatments, with the exception of antibiotic ointments applied to closed skin, which are adequately assessed elsewhere, and a meta-analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Only randomized trials of patients having only colorectal surgery were included in this review. Studies were sought in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, Clinical Trials.gov, and the World Health Organization Internet clinical trials register portal. In addition, reference lists of included studies and other published reviews were screened. Meta-analysis was performed for all included studies and subgroup analyses done for each individual intervention. Risk of bias was assessed for each included study, paying particular attention to the preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis used in each study. Sensitivity analyses were done to investigate heterogeneity of the analyses, excluding those studies with a significant risk of bias issues. Absolute risk reduction (RR) was calculated. The overall quality of the evidence for each individual intervention was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, and was classified as high, moderate, low or very low.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 30 studies are included in this review with 5511 patients, 665 of whom had SSI. The interventions included: 10 studies of gentamicin impregnated sponge or beads wound inlays, 4 studies of chlorhexidine impregnated suture, 11 studies of direct wound lavage or powder application or injection of antibiotics before closure, 4 studies of ionized silver dressing applied to the closed skin, and 1 study of vitamin E oil applied to the open wound. All but one study used preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in addition to topical procedures, although, in some studies, the systemic antibiotic prophylaxis was not the same between groups or varied significantly from the recommended guidelines. Use of gentamycin sponge did not decrease SSI (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.75-1.16; low-quality evidence) even after including only the studies of abdominal wounds (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.80-1.30; low-quality evidence). However, sensitivity analysis excluding studies at high risk of bias decreased the heterogeneity and increased the effect of the prophylaxis for all wounds (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.33-0.78; low-quality evidence) and for abdominal wounds only (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20-0.72; moderate-quality evidence). Chlorhexidine impregnated suture showed no effect on SSI (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56-1.10; low-quality evidence) and an increased efficacy after sensitivity analysis (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.79; low-quality evidence). Antibiotic lavage showed a significant decrease in SSI (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.79; low-quality evidence) which increased after sensitivity analysis (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15-0.72; moderate-quality evidence). Application of silver dressing to the closed wound resulted in a decrease of SSI (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35-0.85; moderate-quality evidence). The one study of topical vitamin E oil applied to the open wound showed a significant risk reduction (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05-0.98; low-quality evidence).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Each of these interventions appears to be effective in decreasing SSI, but the number of studies for each is small and the quality of evidence is very low to moderate. Within the various outcomes of GRADE assessment, even a moderate classification suggests that further studies may well have very different results.. No randomized trials exist of combinations of two or more of the above interventions to see if there is a combined effect. Future studies should make sure that the antibiotic used preoperatively is uniform within a study and is consistent with the current guidelines. Deviation from this leads to a significant heterogeneity and risk of bias."

A total of 150 consecutive patients (50 at each department) hospitalized since January 2012 were included into the retrospective observation (period I). In order to perform prospective evaluation of CPM, a total of 66 consecutive patients (randomized 1:1) hospitalized since December 2012 (period II) were followed up at each of the departments. Antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) with IV amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.2 g) was planned for all patients from period II. The study group (group 1) included patients with surgical wound closure with triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 and additionally with a skin 2-octylcyanoacrylate-based adhesive. The control group (group 2) included patients with surgical wound closure with non-triclosan-coated polyglactin 910. Each patient from the period II was assigned to an \"Individual SSI Prevention Package\" (IPP), which included an antibiotic, sutures, skin adhesive (only in a package for CPM) and label \"AP\" for patients' medical records. Patients' medical records were reviewed by one expert. Exclusion criteria were: age <14 years; transition to midline laparotomy; drainage of the abdominal cavity through the surgical wound; simultaneous interventions; secondary appendicitis; refusal to use of sutures from the IPP. In order to determine signs of SSI presence/absence within 30 days after surgery, attempts to contact with patients by phone were made. The data obtained was recorded into case report forms and then entered into the study database.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 322 patients were included into the final analysis (mean age: 34.8±17.1 years).

The AP during the periods I and II was performed in 56.1% (83/148) and 97.7% (170/174) of patients, respectively (p<0.00001). Cephalosporins I-IV were the most frequently used antibiotics during the period I (85.6%). During the period II, amoxicillin/clavulanate from IPP was used in 98.2% of patients. Percentage of IV antibiotic administration in different time periods was 57.3% and 98.2%, respectively (p<0.0001); frequency of the first administration before skin incision was 53.6% and 97.1%, respectively (p<0.0001). The telephone contact with patient was successful in 74.8% (both periods), 56.8% (period I) and 90.2% (period II) of cases, respectively. SSI was recorded only once per patient with the following priority: SSI was documented in the patient's medical record; patient developed SSI that was not documented (in the expert's opinion) in the patient's medical record; SSI signs were determined during the telephone contact or reported by the patient. The incidence of SSI in both study periods, period I and period II was 14.9%, 15.5% and 14.4%, respectively (p>0.05 for all comparisons). In the patient subgroup with successful telephone contact, the incidence of SSI in both study periods, period I and period II was 17.4%, 21.4% and 15.3%, respectively; the incidence of SSI in group 1 and group 2 of the period II was 12.0% and 18.9%, respectively (p>0.05 for all comparisons).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      SSI after an open appendectomy remains an important problem.

In multivariate analyses, a postoperative catheterization longer than 2 days was associated with an increased likelihood of in-hospital urinary tract infection (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.41) and 30-day mortality (parameter estimate, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.37-0.72) as well as a decreased likelihood of discharge to home (parameter estimate, - 0.57; 95% CI, - 0.64 to - 1.51).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Indwelling urinary catheters are routinely in place longer than 2 days postoperatively and may result in excess nosocomial infections.

The primary outcomes of the models were infections prevented and health care costs. We modelled the cost-effectiveness of decolonization in a hypothetical cohort of adult patients undergoing hip and knee replacement in Alberta, Canada. Information on the incidence of complex surgical site infections (SSIs), as well as the cost of care for patients with and without SSIs was taken from a provincial infection control database, and health administrative data.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Use of the decolonization bundle was cost saving compared to usual care ($153/person), and resulted in 16 complex Staphylococcus aureus SSIs annually as opposed to 32 (with approximately 8000 hip or knee arthroplasties performed). The probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the majority (84%) of the time the decolonization bundle was cost saving. The model was robust to one-way sensitivity analyses conducted within plausible ranges. There were small upfront costs associated with using a decolonization protocol, however, this model demonstrated cost savings over one year. In a Markov model that considered the impact of a decolonization bundle over a lifetime as it pertained to the need for subsequent joint replacements and patient quality of life, the bundle still resulted in cost savings ($161/person).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Decolonization for Staphylococcus aureus prior to hip and knee replacements resulted in cost savings and fewer SSIs, and should be considered prior to these procedures."

            "abstract": "Peri/post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis (POABP) has become standard practice for preventing surgical site infections (SSI) in head and neck cancer patients undergoing microvascular reconstruction, but few data exist on optimal POABP regimens. Current surgical prophylaxis guideline recommendations fail to account for the complexity of microvascular reconstruction relative to other head and neck procedures, specifically regarding wound classification and antibiotic duration. Selection of POABP spectrum is also controversial, and must balance the choice between too narrow, risking subsequent infection, or too broad, and possible unwanted effects (e.g. antibiotic resistance, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea). POABP regimens should retain activity against bacteria expected to colonize the upper respiratory/salivary tracts, which include Gram-positive organisms and facultative anaerobes. However, Gram-negative bacilli also contribute to SSI in this setting. POABP doses should be optimized in order to achieve therapeutic tissue concentrations at the surgical site. Antibiotics targeted towards methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa are not warranted for all patients. Prolonged POABP durations have shown no differences in SSI when compared to short POABP durations, but prolonged durations provide unnecessarily antibiotic exposure and risk for adverse effects. Given the lack of standardization behind antibiotic POABP in this setting and the potential for poor patient outcomes, this practice necessitates an additional focus of surgeons and antimicrobial stewardship programs. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of POABP evidence and discuss pertinent clinical implications of appropriate use."

With a focus on procedures in which Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) are the main pathogens causing SSI, this review summarizes the evidence and describes how SAP must evolve in response to carriage of MDR GNB among surgical patients. Randomized controlled trials of SAP for carriers of resistant GNB require prohibitively large sample sizes. No professional guidelines address the topic of adapting SAP for known carriers of resistant GNB. For patients whose carrier status is unknown, the effects of different SAP strategies have been studied for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy and colorectal surgery. The four possible strategies for SAP in the era of antibiotic resistance are: no SAP; universal standard SAP; pre-surgical screening for carriage of antibiotic-resistant pathogens before surgery and targeted SAP (i.e. broad-spectrum antibiotics only for those who screen positive); and universal broad-spectrum SAP. The prevalence of carriage determines the efficiency of each strategy. Decolonization is a potential adjunct to SAP."

Machine learning algorithms were developed using images collected as part of a clinical study that included 530 women in rural Rwanda who underwent cesarean section surgery. Thermal images were collected approximately 10 days after surgery, in conjunction with an examination by a trained doctor to determine the status of the wound (infected or not). Of the 530 women, 30 were found to have infected wounds. The data were used to develop two Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) models, with special care taken to avoid overfitting and address the problem of class imbalance in binary classification. The first model, a 6-layer naïve CNN model, demonstrated a median accuracy of AUC=0.84 with sensitivity=71% and specificity=87%. The transfer learning CNN model demonstrated a median accuracy of AUC=0.90 with sensitivity =95% and specificity=84%. To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of a machine learning algorithm to predict surgical infection using thermal images alone.Clinical Relevance- This work establishes a promising new method for automated detection of surgical site infection."

Approximately one-quarter (26%) of surgeons had used telehealth post-operatively with patients in the last 3 months. The most frequently endorsed barriers to use related to quality of care: 'I cannot undertake a patient examination' and 'I cannot provide the same level of care as during an in-person consultation'; and convenience and efficiency: 'Teleconsultations are more difficult to arrange'. Surgeons who had recently used telehealth were less likely to endorse most barriers. Younger age, awareness of Medicare telehealth reimbursement and working in neurosurgery, urology, paediatric surgery and plastic and reconstructive surgery (compared to general surgery) were associated with recent telehealth use by surgeons.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Some surgeons' perceived barriers to telehealth pre-COVID may be overcome by COVID-19-related telehealth uptake and familiarisation. However, many barriers will need to be addressed to ensure that telehealth adoption is sustained beyond the pandemic."

Previous investigations have not fully established the relationship of BMI and perioperative transfusion with surgical site infection (SSI) or the relationship of BMI and perioperative transfusion after TKA or THA.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to perform a retrospective cohort study involving 333,223 TKA and 41,157 THA cases between 2011 and 2018. Multivariable regression assessed the associations of BMI (5 standard categories) and transfusion with SSI. Odds ratio (OR) of SSI was calculated relative to a normal BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m 2 ) after adjustment of potential confounding factors.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Perioperative transfusion decreased significantly over time for both TKA and THA; however, SSI rates remained steady at just under 1% for TKA and 3% for THA. In TKA, a higher OR for SSI was associated only with a BMI of 40+ (OR, 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60-2.18) compared to a referent BMI. In THA, increased ORs of SSI were seen for all BMI levels above normal and were highest for a BMI 40+ (OR, 3.08; 95% CI, 2.47-3.83). In TKA, ORs of transfusion decreased with increasing BMI and were lowest for a BMI 40+ (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.47-0.54).

In TKA, ORs for SSI increased, but ORs for transfusion decreased with increasing BMI above normal. Conversely, in THA, ORs for SSI and transfusion both increased for a BMI 40+, but only OR for transfusion increased in underweight patients. These findings suggest the importance of controlling obesity in reducing SSI following TKA and THA."

Although standards in the medical literature spell out recommendations for specific procedures, agents, schedules, and doses, other reports document that these standards frequently are not followed in practice.\n    \n\n\n          Options:\n        \n      \n      We have specified the procedures in which the administration of prophylactic antimicrobial agents has been shown to be beneficial, those in which this practice is widely thought to be beneficial but in which compelling evidence is lacking, and those in which this practice is controversial. We have examined the evidence regarding the optimal timing of drug administration, the optimal dose, and the optimal duration of prophylaxis.\n    \n\n\n          Outcomes:\n        \n      \n      The intended outcome is more uniform and reliable administration of prophylactic antibiotics in those circumstances where their value has been demonstrated or their use has been judged by the local practicing medical community to be desirable. The result should be a reduction in rates of postoperative wound infection in conjunction with a limitation on the quantities of antimicrobial agents used in circumstances where they are not likely to help.\n    \n\n\n          Evidence:\n        \n      \n      Many prospective, randomized, controlled trials comparing placebo with antibiotic and comparing one antibiotic with another have been conducted. In addition, some trials have compared the efficacy of different doses or methods of administration. Other papers have reported on the apparent efficacy of administration at different times and on actual practice in specific communities. Only a small group of relevant articles found through 1993 are cited herein. When authoritative reviews are available, these--rather than an exhaustive list of original references--are cited.\n    \n\n\n          Values:\n        \n      \n      We assumed that reducing rates of postoperative infection was valuable but that reducing the total amount of antimicrobial agents employed was also worthwhile. The cost of and morbidity attributable to postoperative wound infections should be weighted against the cost and potential morbidity associated with excessive use of antimicrobial agents.\n    \n\n\n          Benefits, harms, and costs:\n        \n      \n      More reliable administration of antimicrobial agents according to recognized guidelines should prevent some postoperative wound infections while lowering the total quantity of these drugs used. No harms are anticipated. The costs involved are those of the efforts needed on a local basis to design and implement the mechanism that supports uniform and reliable administration of prophylactic antibiotics.\n    \n\n\n          Recommendations:\n        \n      \n      All patients for whom prophylactic antimicrobial agents are recommended should receive them. The agents given should be appropriate in light of published guidelines. A short duration of prophylaxis (usually < 24 hours) is recommended.\n    \n\n\n          Validation:\n        \n      \n      More than 50 experts in infectious diseases and 10 experts in surgical infectious diseases and surgical subspecialties reviewed the standard.

Twenty-four hours after LASIK, 2 patients developed infectious keratitis, 1 bilaterally. In each eye, the corneal flap was edematous, ulcerated, and detached from the stromal bed. Treatment included removal of the necrotic flap and aggressive antibiotic therapy. Cultures from corneal exudates were positive for S marcescens. After 1 year, both patients had a loss of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ranging from 20/40 to 20/22 because of irregular astigmatism. Overrefraction with a hard contact lens resulted in a BCVA of 20/20 in the 3 affected eyes. Slitlamp examination showed trace subepithelial haze without severe corneal scarring. Videokeratography disclosed areas of paracentral inferior steepening resembling keratoconus. Refraction and videokeratography remained stable after 6 months of follow-up. Ulcerative keratitis caused by S marcescens is a potential complication of LASIK. Bilateral involvement may occur if bilateral simultaneous surgery is performed."

Even so, wound infections are not uncommon and obesity increases the risk. Currently, no independent wound assessment technology is available to stratify women to low or high risk of surgical site infection (SSI).Study Aim: to investigate the potential of non-invasive infrared thermography (IRT), performed at short times after surgery, to predict later SSI.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      IRT was undertaken in hospital on day 2 with community follow up (days 7, 15, 30) after surgery. Thermal maps of wound site and abdomen were accompanied by digital photographs, the latter used for wound assessment by six experienced healthcare professionals. Confirmatory diagnosis of SSI was made on the basis of antibiotic prescribing by the woman's community physician with logistic regression models derived to model dichotomous outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Fifty-three women aged 21-44 years with BMI 30.1-43.9 Kg.m- 2 were recruited. SSI rate (within 30 days) was 28%. Inter-rater variability for 'professional' opinion of wound appearance showed poor levels of agreement. Two regions of interest were interrogated; wound site and abdomen. Wound site temperature was consistently elevated (1.5 °C) above abdominal temperature with similar values at days 2,7,15 in those who did and did not, develop SSI. Mean abdominal temperature was lower in women who subsequently developed SSI; significantly so at day 7. A unit (1 °C) reduction in abdominal temperature was associated with a 3-fold raised odds of infection. The difference between the sites (wound minus abdomen temperature) was significantly associated with odds of infection; with a 1 °C widening in temperature associated with an odds ratio for SSI of 2.25 (day 2) and 2.5 (day 7). Correct predictions for wound outcome using logistic regression models ranged from 70 to 79%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      IRT imaging of wound and abdomen in obese women undergoing c-section improves upon visual (subjective) wound assessment. The proportion of cases correctly classified using the wound-abdominal temperature differences holds promise for precision and performance of IRT as an independent SSI prognostic tool and future technology to aid decision making in antibiotic prescribing."

Surgeons reported greater confidence when vignettes included a wound photograph compared with vignettes without a wound photograph, regardless of whether they correctly identified an SSI (median, 8 [interquartile range, 6-9] vs median, 8 [interquartile range, 7-9]; P < .001) but they were more likely to undertriage patients when vignettes included a wound photograph, regardless of whether they correctly identified an SSI.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      In a practical simulation, wound photography increased specificity and surgeon confidence, but worsened sensitivity for detection of SSIs. Remote evaluation of patient-generated wound photographs may not accurately reflect the clinical state of surgical incisions. Effective widespread implementation of remote postoperative assessment with photography may require additional development of tools, participant training, and mechanisms to verify image quality."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Previously, we reported that the Ventral Hernia Risk Score (VHRS) was more accurate in a Veterans Affairs (VA) population in predicting surgical site infection (SSI) after open ventral hernia repair (VHR) compared with other models such as the Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG) model. The VHRS was developed using single-center data and stratifies SSI risk into five groups based on concomitant hernia repair, skin flaps created, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score ≥3, body mass index ≥40 kg/m(2), and incision class 4. The purpose of this study was to validate the VHRS for other hospitals.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A prospective database of all open VHRs performed at three institutions from 2009-2011 was utilized. All 436 patients with a follow-up of at least 1 mo were included. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition of SSI was utilized. Each patient was assigned a VHRS, VHWG, and CDC incision classification. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were used to assess predictive accuracy, and the areas under the curve (AUCs) were compared for the three risk-stratification systems.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The median follow-up was 20 mos (range 1-49 mos). During this time, 111 patients (25.5%) developed a SSI. The AUC of the VHRS (0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.78) was greater than that of the VHWG (0.66; 95% CI 0.60-0.72; p<0.01) and the CDC incision class (0.68; 95% CI 0.61-0.74; p<0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The VHRS provides a novel, internally and externally validated score for a patient's likelihood of developing a SSI after open VHR. Elevating skin flaps, ASA score ≥3, concomitant procedures, morbid obesity, and incision class all independently predicted SSI. It remains to be determined if pre-operative patient selection and risk reduction, surgical techniques, and post-operative management can improve outcomes in the highest-risk patients. The VHRS provides a starting point for key stakeholders to discuss the management of ventral hernias."

No publication appears to address the timing of definitive care for a stable, spontaneous, pneumothorax (SP) by unscheduled, or urgent, video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). We reviewed the literature and describe our series of 38 patients with SP and VATS. Of 185 patients with SP, 38 were presented for VATS. Of these 29% were unscheduled. Average time between diagnosis of SP and VATS was 11 days, with four days between decision for VATS and its execution. Post-operative antibiotics were prescribed to 37% of patients. There was a correlation between chest drain time in situ and infective signs (p = 0.001, rho = 0.654) as well as proven infections (p = 0.05, rho = 0.386), but not between for scheduled and unscheduled procedures. In conclusion, our case series and review did not identify reasons why VATS for SP should be performed as an urgent procedure, though we support more rapid planning."

We investigated Enterobacterales containing resistance genes (blaCTX-M-15, blaNDM and blaOXA-48-like) for identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing. Genotypes, phylogenetic relationships and transmission events for isolates from different sources were investigated using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis with a cut-off of ≤20 SNPs. Escherichia coli (14.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%) and Enterobacter cloacae (16.3%) were the main MDRE species isolated. The carbapenemase gene blaNDM was most commonly detected, with 15.5%, 15.1% and 13.3% of samples positive in SSIs, HSs and arthropods, respectively.

The secondary aim is to determine the recurrence rate and analyse the surgical complications. The tertiary aim is to present the quality of life test results performed 3, 6 and 12 months after the surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and method:\n        \n      \n      The authors evaluated the results of 36 recurrent and/or infected incisional hernia surgeries (11 men, average age 60.6 years; 25 women, average age 58.9 years) performed with their own surgical method in the framework of a tightly controlled, prospective, interventional and observational consecutive cohort study conducted between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2013 at a university surgical department. The study evaluates the results of the 1-year follow-up period. All 36 patients had at least one recurrence of abdominal wall hernia; 12 of them also had concurrent infection of the synthetic graft and a complicating fistula. The mean BMI was 31.82 kg/m(2) (25.2-43.5 kg/m(2)). The average size of the abdominal wall defect was 145.9 cm(2) (59-275 cm(2)). The abdominal wall reconstruction was performed using an autologous, double-layer dermal flap. The grafts, which had been inserted during previous surgeries, were removed completely. The autologous dermal tissue was prepared using the flap harvested during dermolipectomy. The reconstruction was achieved using a tension-free technique. The essence of the abdominal wall reconstruction is the completion of the abdominal wall defect by a double-layer autologous dermal flap. The original abdominal wall defect was not closed by direct sutures. The quality of the prepared dermal flap was histologically evaluated. IAPMS (intra-abdominal pressure monitoring set) was applied to verify intra-abdominal pressure in the post-operative period. The result of the surgeries was assessed using a quality of life questionnaire.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      No recurrence of the abdominal wall hernia was registered during the 1-year follow-up period. Abdominal bulking was observed in case of three patients (8.3 %). Wound infection occurred in one patient (2.77 %) and skin dehiscence in two patients (5.55 %). Haematoma was registered in case of one patient (2.77 %) on the fifth post-operative day. Seroma formation occurred in case of eight patients (22.22 %), which required percutaneous tapping. A fistula formation was observed in one patient (2.77 %) 45 days after the surgery. The intra-abdominal pressure remained moderately elevated during the early post-operative period (9.65-5.76 mmHg on post-operative days 1 and 5). Reoperation was performed in one case due to haematoma. No fatality occurred.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The 1-year recurrence rate in case of the abdominal wall reconstruction using double-layer autologous dermal flap is favourable. Being compliant with the surgical technique developed, the procedure is safe to perform. The number of surgical site infections and fistula formations is low. Based on the questionnaires evaluated, all patients would choose this method instead of the previous reconstruction(s). The method is cost-effective. Based on the results, this procedure is feasible for the treatment of recurrent and/or infected abdominal wall, incisional ventral hernias in obese \"high risk\" patients."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To identify surgical site infection (SSI) rates following pediatric ambulatory surgery, SSI outcomes and risk factors, and sensitivity and specificity of SSI administrative billing codes. DESIGN Retrospective chart review of pediatric ambulatory surgeries with International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for SSI, and a systematic random sampling of 5% of surgeries without SSI ICD-9 codes, all adjudicated for SSI on the basis of an ambulatory-adapted National Healthcare Safety Network definition. SETTING Urban pediatric tertiary care center April 1, 2009-March 31, 2014. METHODS SSI rates and sensitivity and specificity of ICD-9 codes were estimated using sampling design, and risk factors were analyzed in case-rest of cohort, and case-control, designs. RESULTS In 15,448 pediatric ambulatory surgeries, 34 patients had ICD-9 codes for SSI and 25 met the adapted National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. One additional SSI was identified with systematic random sampling. The SSI rate following pediatric ambulatory surgery was 2.9 per 1,000 surgeries (95% CI, 1.2-6.9). Otolaryngology surgeries demonstrated significantly lower SSI rates compared with endocrine (P=.001), integumentary (P=.001), male genital (P<.0001), and respiratory (P=.01) surgeries. Almost half of patients with an SSI were admitted, 88% received antibiotics, and 15% returned to the operating room. No risk factors were associated with SSI. The sensitivity of ICD-9 codes for SSI following ambulatory surgery was 55.31% (95% CI, 12.69%-91.33%) and specificity was 99.94% (99.89%-99.97%). CONCLUSIONS SSI following pediatric ambulatory surgery occurs at an appreciable rate and conveys morbidity on children. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2016;37:931-938."

            "abstract": "This \"What's new in instrumental dermatology\" dedicated skin surgeryis based upon a 2015-2017 literature analysis. The excision of skin cancers is an important part of surgical dermatology. Will artificial intelligence and new drug be able to face the increasing need for therapy? Wrong-site surgery is due to multiple factors. Photographs of biopsy site and short time between biopsy and surgery decrease postponement of surgery and wrong-site surgery. Noninvasive imaging technologies are improving and help to delineate skin tumors and increase the probability of complete tumor removal. They are beginning to be an essential tool for skin surgery. The 2005 recommendations for the management of melanoma stages I to III have been updated in 2016. The Slow-Mohs technique is the better way to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans whose sub-clinical invasion is often asymmetric and unpredictable. Wide local excision for the treatment of severe hidradenitis suppurativa improves the quality of life and decreases recurrence rate. Cutaneous surgery is considered as safe procedures with a low risk of complications. Postoperative bleedings are the most frequent. Anti-thrombotics enhance the risk, but must not be stopped or bridged, except the novel oral anticoagulants which can be interrupted 24h before surgery and started again a few hours after. The risk of surgical site infections is low in dermatologic surgery. Most recommended measures to prevent them have been extrapolated from other types of surgery and the level of evidence is low. The reconstruction of skin defect must be adapted on size and location. A birhombic transposition flap is reliable in case of a defect too large to be repaired by a single flap. Full-thickness skin graft is a safe option to repair defect on the external ear."

Since SCVs grow slowly and have a confusing morphology, the identification of infections due to SCV is difficult. We have identified SCVs in two patients who presented with persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia complicated by surgical site infections after cardiothoracic surgery. Nine blood isolates were collected from the two patients for species identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and phenotypic and genotypic characterization. Colonies on Columbia blood agar were pinpoint, nonpigmented, nonhemolytic, and reverted to normal colonies after 48 hr of incubation on Schaedler agar. Auxotrophy assays revealed hemin dependence. Susceptibility to vancomycin (minimal inhibitory concentrations 1.0 μg/mL) was confirmed by E-test and broth microdilution test. All the isolates were identified as MRSA by multiplex polymerase chain reaction specific for the mecA, femA, and 16S rRNA genes, and all had the same genotype: Multilocus sequence typing ST5, SCCmec type II, agr type II, and spa type t2460. Moreover pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing revealed that all nine isolates belonged to the same clone. Mutations in the relA gene were not found, and none of the isolates was identified as hVISA by population analysis profiling-AUC ratio. A high level of suspicion is required to detect SCVs, and although it is not common, the possibility of the SCV phenotype has to be considered in persistent S. aureus bacteremia."

Patients delivered by C/S at ≥24 weeks of gestation were segregated into four epochs over 7 years: (1) baseline (18 months when povidone-iodine was used); (2) CHG scrub (18 months after skin prep was switched to CHG); (3) bundle implementation (24 months); and (4) maintenance (24 months following implementation).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 3,637 patients were included (n = 667, 796, 1098, and 1076, respectively, in epochs 1-4).

            "abstract": "Despite the substantial growth of telemedicine and the evidence of its advantages, the use of telemedicine in neurosurgery has been limited. Barriers have included medicolegal issues surrounding provider reimbursement, interstate licensure, and malpractice liability as well as technological challenges. Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has limited typical evaluation of patients with neurologic issues and resulted in a surge in demand for virtual medical visits. Meanwhile, federal and state governments took action to facilitate the rapid implementation of telehealth programs, placing a temporary lift on medicolegal barriers that had previously limited its expansion. This created a unique opportunity for widespread telehealth use to meet the surge in demand for remote medical care. After initial hurdles and challenges, our experience with telemedicine in neurosurgery at Penn Medicine has been overall positive from both the provider and the patients' perspective. One of the unique challenges we face is guiding patients to appropriately set up devices in a way that enables an effective neuroexamination. However, we argue that an accurate and comprehensive neurologic examination can be conducted through a telemedicine platform, despite minor weaknesses inherent to absence of physical presence. In addition, certain neurosurgical visits such as postoperative checks, vascular pathology, and brain tumors inherently lend themselves to easier evaluation through telehealth visits. In the era of COVID-19 and beyond, telemedicine remains a promising and effective approach to continue neurologic patient care."

These represented 12.7 % of SI, and the annual incidence of LSI was 0.28 % in our series. Peritonitis, generally due to appendicitis, was the cause of LSI in 11 cases. Hematogenous contamination was diagnosed in eight cases, because the germ was Haemophilus,Pneumococcus, or Listeria, or an ENT infection had preceded SI; the incidence of purulent meningitis was significantly higher in shunted patients than in the general population. LSI was due in seven cases to bowel perforation, and in four to direct inoculation, after abdominal surgery or traumatic exposure of the shunt. In the remaining 10 cases, no potential cause of infection was identified, and persistence of a germ since the previous shunt operation was suspected.

After Shouldice repair hospital stay was 3.9 days with an average patients age of 48.3 years, after Bassini 5.41 days (mean age 46.4 years), after Lichtenstein repair 5.23 days (mean age 66.0 years). 82 (77.4%) from 106 patients returned the questionnaire. 67 (81.7%) were completely satisfied, 11 (13.6%) mentioned minor problems. So 95.1% had a normal primary wound healing without infection. There was no correlation between wound healing, type of hernia, age, hospital stay, surgeon or method of operation. In the same study other complications occurred (e.g. 5% recurrences of hernias, nerve lesions), that could not be integrated into the evaluation because they were excluded by definition.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Studying the tracer \"wound healing after groin hernia repair\" allows an approximate follow-up for quality control with little expense. Because of the narrow point of view and the neglect of other complications in the same investigation we estimate the power of the result as limited."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of burr hole cover placement to improve the aesthetic outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We reviewed consecutive patients treated by burr hole trepanation for cSDH with or without placement of burr hole covers by a single surgeon between October 2016 and May 2018. The clinical data, including complications, were derived from the institution's prospective patient registry. The primary endpoint was the aesthetic outcome, as perceived by patients on the aesthetic numeric analog (ANA) scale, assessed by means of a standardized telephone interview. Secondary endpoints were skin depression rates and wound pain, as well as complications.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      From n = 33, outcome evaluation was possible in n = 28 patients (n = 24 male; mean age of 70.4 ± 16.1 years) with uni- (n = 20) or bilateral cSDH (n = 8). A total of 14 burr hole covers were placed in 11 patients and compared to 50 burr holes that were not covered. Patient satisfaction with the aesthetic outcome was significantly better for covered burr holes (mean ANA 9.3 ± 0.74 vs. 7.9 ± 1.0; p < 0.001). Skin depressions occurred over 7% (n = 1/14) of covered and over 92% (n = 46/50) of uncovered burr holes (p < 0.001). There was no difference in wound pain (p = 0.903) between covered and uncovered sites. No surgical site infection, cSDH recurrence, or material failure was encountered in patients who had received a burr hole plate.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this retrospective series, placement of burr hole covers was associated with improved aesthetic outcome, likely due to reduction of skin depressions. A randomized controlled trial is developed to investigate whether adding burr hole covers results in superior aesthetic outcomes, without increasing the risk for complications."

            "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is associated with surgical complications, including wound healing and surgical site infection. However, the association between smoking status and postoperative wound complications is not completely understood. Our objective was to investigate the effect of smoking on postoperative wound complications for major surgeries. Data were collected from the 2013 to 2018 participant use files of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. A propensity score matching procedure was used to create the balanced smoker and nonsmoker groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for postoperative wound complications, pulmonary complications, and in-hospital mortality associated with smokers. A total of 1 156 002 patients (578 001 smokers and 578 001 nonsmokers) were included in the propensity score matching analysis. Smoking was associated with a significantly increased risk of postoperative wound disruption (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.56-1.75), surgical site infection (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.28-1.34), reintubation (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.40-1.54), and in-hospital mortality (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07-1.19) compared with nonsmoking. The length of hospital stay was significantly increased in smokers compared with nonsmokers. Our analysis indicates that smoking is associated with an increased risk of surgical site infection, wound disruption, and postoperative pulmonary complications. The results may drive the clinicians to encourage patients to quit smoking before surgery."

Facilitating transition from hospital to outpatient care with digital image-based wound monitoring has the potential to detect and to enable treatment of SSI at an early stage. In this study, we evaluated whether smartphone digital images can supplant in-person evaluation of postoperative vascular surgery wounds.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We developed a wound assessment checklist using previously validated criteria. We recruited adults who underwent a vascular surgical procedure between 2014 and 2015, involving an incision of at least 3 cm, from a high-volume academic vascular surgery service. Vascular surgery care providers evaluated wounds in person using the assessment checklist; a different group of providers evaluated wounds by a smartphone digital image.

Regardless of modality, inter-rater agreement was poor when wounds were evaluated for the presence of ecchymosis and redness; moderate for cellulitis; and high for the presence of a drain, necrosis, or dehiscence. As expected, the presence of drainage was more readily observed in person. Inter-rater agreement was high for both in-person and image-based assessment with respect to course of treatment, with near-perfect agreement for treatments ranging from antibiotics to surgical débridement to hospital readmission. No difference in agreement emerged when raters evaluated poor-quality compared with high-quality images.

This gave an incidence of 30.1% infection rate. While 783 (89.2%) cultures yielded single organism, 77 (9.8%) yielded mixed growth and 18(8.1%) cultures yielded no growth. The most frequently isolated organism was E. coli (25.5%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus 20.6%. The incidence of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 35.7%. Ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and ofloxacin showed good results against most isolates while ampicillin and cotrimoxazole which are commonly used drugs were ineffective. An understanding of the various types of pathogen involved in SSI and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern will reduce indiscriminate prescription of antibiotics and help in infection control."

Six trials, two of which had three comparison arms, (972 participants) compared hair removal (shaving, clipping, or depilatory cream) with no hair removal and found no statistically significant difference in SSI rates however the comparison is underpowered. Three trials (1343 participants) that compared shaving with clipping showed significantly more SSIs associated with shaving (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.80). Seven trials (1213 participants) found no significant difference in SSI rates when hair removal by shaving was compared with depilatory cream (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.21), however this comparison is also underpowered. One trial compared two groups that shaved or clipped hair on the day of surgery compared with the day before surgery; there was no statistically significant difference in the number of SSIs between groups however this comparison was also underpowered.We identified no trials that compared clipping with depilatory cream; or investigated application of depilatory cream at different pre-operative time points, or hair removal in different settings (e.g. ward, anaesthetic room).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Whilst this review found no statistically significant effect on SSI rates of hair removal insufficient numbers of people have been involved in this research to allow confidence in a conclusion. When it is necessary to remove hair, the existing evidence suggests that clippers are associated with fewer SSIs than razors. There was no significant difference in SSI rates between depilatory creams and shaving, or between shaving or clipping the day before surgery or on the day of surgery however studies were small and more research is needed."

In addition to difficulties in distinguishing early infections from other post-surgical complications (such as hematoma, seroma, and liponecrosis) late breast implant infections still represent a grey area of our knowledge with regards to heir definition and management. To address this issue, we prospectively monitored breast cancer patients at their center.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Between February 1, 2009, and May 31, 2013, we enrolled all patients undergoing breast implant reconstruction or expander-to-prosthesis substitution. Patients without at least 6 mo of post-operative observation were excluded. We collected data from patient records including age, days from surgery (DFS), chemotherapy/radiotherapy, infecting microorganism, type of implant, antibiotic management and eventual implant removal. Sixty days from surgery were defined as the clinical threshold between early and late infection. Infections were further classified according to a graded scale into possible, probable and microbiologically proved.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Seventy-eight infections were recorded out of 766 surgical procedures (10.2%). Fifty-three (67%) cases occurred early ≤60 DFS, and 25 (33%) occurred late (i.e., beyond 60 d). By defining infection types as possible, probable or proved, the majority of late infections were classified as proved (84%) compared with 56% of early infections (p=0.0014). Microbiological isolate distribution was similar in proved early infections compared with proved late infections. Among late infections, a delayed occurrence was observed after prosthesis placement compared with expander insertion. Late infections were fraught with lower treatment success rates (12% vs. 41%, p=0.009).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Late infection represents a consistent proportion of infections after immediate breast implant reconstruction or prosthesis placement and bear lower chance of salvage after treatment.

Comparing three time periods (1985, 86, 87) no significant amelioration of complication rates were found. But factors influencing complications like very high age of patients, seriousness of the disease, and diabetes were not evenly distributed in all three samples.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted the dynamics of health care and neurosurgical practice. Elective surgeries were suspended for 8 weeks in Kentucky. Our objective was to determine if telehealth (TH) visits could be sustained as an alternative to in-person visits.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Deidentified data on TH usage, in-person clinic visits, and inpatient and neurosurgical case volumes from March 2, 2020 to June 26, 2020 were obtained for retrospective analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      TH use increased soon after the case suspension started and then decreased to little usage. The number of in-person visits were significantly lower during elective case suspension compared with when cases were resumed. Twenty-five percent of all visits during the suspension were conducted using TH. Thirty-nine percent of TH-visit patients were new patients, 11% were preoperative, 10% were postoperative, and 39% were other existing patients. Forty-eight percent of TH visits resulted in a later in-person clinic visit. After the suspension, in-person visits rebounded to 98% of the prepandemic numbers and TH visits were low.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      TH visits were challenging due to the need for in-person physical examinations in neurosurgery. TH temporarily accommodated patient needs during the pandemic but could not totally replace in-person visits and was not sustained after 3.5 months of use. Video TH visits worked well for nonurgent issues, such as minor visual examinations. Our findings could help guide the implementation of TH should similar circumstances arise again."

Out of 500 Italian orthopedic centers requested, 225 have participated in this study. A total of 136,321 surgical procedures were reported in the 166 centers reporting complete answers on type of surgery. They comprised hip and knee prosthesis (13.9%), spine surgery (4%), hip endoprosthesis (5.2%), osteosynthesis (26.9%), arthroscopy (24.4%), and others (25.5%). Perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis was used in 75% of operations (ranging from 57.1% to 99.4% in arthroscopy and joint prosthesis, respectively). Short term (< 24 h) antimicrobial prophylaxis was performed in 38.4% of the 206 Centers answering this question correctly. 61.1% of Centers employed single agent prophylaxis. 70.8% of these prescriptions were betalactam antibiotics. Bacteriological analysis of the wound in 86 Centers (total number of isolates 2013) revealed the presence of Gram-positive isolates in 73.7% of cases. Methicillin resistance was expressed in 45% of 915 tested strains. Out of 4221 patients with high risk of infectious complications (joint prosthesis surgery) given antimicrobial prophylaxis in 46 Centers, the percentage of surgical wound infections was overall 2.1%, while that of non-surgical wound infections was 3.6%. A decrease in the total infection rate by about half was associated with long-term (> 24 h) as compared to short-term (< 24 h) antibiotic treatment (3.7 vs 7.6%, respectively), and with the use of antibiotic drug combinations vs single antibiotic drugs (3.9 vs 6.6%, respectively). The incidence of surgical-site infection is not decreased by extending the chemoprophylaxis for more than the first 24 h after surgery, while it is reduced from 2.5 to 1.4% by use of combination antibiotic therapy."

Obesity did not impact other outcomes including 30-day mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Obesity is associated with an increased risk of surgical morbidity in EC patients, and is most profound in open surgery and among the morbidly obese. Laparoscopic surgery may well prevent the majority of postoperative complications in this group of patients, and should therefore be the favoured approach."

            "abstract": "Objectives: To assess the viability of a hybrid clinic model combining in-person examination with video-based consultation to minimize viral transmission risk. Methods: Data were collected prospectively in a pediatric urology clinic for in-person visits from January to April 2018 (\"classic\") and hybrid visits from October to December 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic (\"hybrid\"). Variables included provider, diagnosis, patient type, time of day, prior surgery, postoperative status, and decision-making for surgery. The primary outcome was \"room time\" or time in-person. The secondary outcome was \"total time\" or visit duration. Proportion of visits involving close contact (room time ≥15 min) was assessed. Univariate analyses were performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test. Mixed models were fitted for visit approach and other covariates as fixed effects and provider as random effect. Results: Data were collected for 346 visits (256 classic, 90 hybrid). Hybrid visits were associated with less room time (median 3 min vs. 10 min, p < 0.001) but greater total time (median 13.5 min vs. 10 min, p = 0.001) as compared with classic visits. On multivariate analysis, hybrid visits were associated with 3 min less room time (95% confidence intervals [CIs]: -5.3 to -1.7, p < 0.001) but 3.8 min more total time (95% CI: 1.5-6.1, p = 0.001). Close contact occurred in 6.7% of hybrid visits, as compared with 34.8% of classic visits (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Hybrid clinic visits reduce room time as compared with classic visits. This approach overcomes the examination limitations of telemedicine while minimizing viral transmission, and represents a viable model for ambulatory care whenever close contact carries infection risk."

Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication of surgical wounds that may delay healing.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effects of wound dressings for preventing SSI in people with surgical wounds healing by primary intention.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 10 May 2011); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011 Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to April Week 4 2011); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, May 9, 2011); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 18); EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 6 May 2011). There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing alternative wound dressings or wound dressings with leaving wounds exposed for postoperative management of surgical wounds healing by primary intention.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction independently.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Sixteen RCTs were included (2578 participants). All trials were at unclear or high risk of bias. Nine trials included people with wounds resulting from surgical procedures with a contamination classification of 'clean', two trials included people with wounds resulting from surgical procedures with a 'clean/contaminated' contamination classification and the remaining trials evaluated people with wounds resulting from various surgical procedures with different contamination classifications. Two trials compared wound dressings with leaving wounds exposed. The remaining 14 trials compared two alternative dressing types. No evidence was identified to suggest that any dressing significantly reduced the risk of developing an SSI compared with leaving wounds exposed or compared with alternative dressings in people who had surgical wounds healing by secondary intention.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      At present, there is no evidence to suggest that covering surgical wounds healing by primary intention with wound dressings reduces the risk of SSI or that any particular wound dressing is more effective than others in reducing the rates of SSI, improving scarring, pain control, patient acceptability or ease of dressing removal. Most trials in this review were small and of poor quality at high or unclear risk of bias. However, based on the current evidence, we conclude that decisions on wound dressing should be based on dressing costs and the symptom management properties offered by each dressing type e.g. exudate management."

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to analyze the complications associated with a series of mandibular angle fractures treated by open reduction and internal fixation and to determine if the method of intraoperative maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) affected patient outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      The records of 162 consecutive patients with isolated mandibular fractures that were treated by the senior author (R.B.B.) with open reduction and internal fixation were retrospectively reviewed and a number of clinical variables were recorded. Of these, all patients with fractures involving the mandibular angle, alone or in combination with other mandibular fractures, were identified. Only patients in the permanent dentition with angle fractures treated with a single 2.0 mm titanium plate placed at the superior border using standard Champy technique were included in the study. Patients with less than 6 weeks follow-up, concomitant midface fractures, edentulous patients, patients with comminuted fractures or gunshot wounds, and those patients presenting with infected fractures were excluded from the primary study group, which totaled 75 patients with 83 angle fractures. Postoperative complications, including infection, malunion/nonunion, wound dehiscence, osteomyelitis, pain, and the need for secondary operative intervention, were tabulated. For purposes of comparison, patients were divided into 3 groups based upon the type of intraoperative MMF utilized: group 1, Erich arch bars (n = 24); group 2, 24 gauge interdental \"Stout\" wires (n = 25); and group 3, manual reduction alone (n = 26). Outcome measures were defined as successful bone healing, acceptable occlusion, minor complications, and major complications. Descriptive statistics were recorded and an analysis of variance was calculated to evaluate differences between the 3 groups. The Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate whether a complication occurred more frequently in any one particular group.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The mean age of the 75 patients included in the study was 28.2 years (M = 63, F = 12) and there were no significant demographic differences between the 3 groups (P = 0.22). All patients eventually achieved successful bony union with an acceptable occlusion. Thirty-two percent of patients in the cohort required a second procedure, usually outpatient removal of loose or symptomatic hardware under local anesthesia or intravenous sedation, but there was no difference in re-operation rate based upon the method of intraoperative fixation (P = .47). Major complications occurred in 2 patients that required secondary operations due to malunion and nonunion (2.7%). Twenty-two minor complications occurred in 16 patients (21.3%) and were evenly distributed amongst the 3 groups (P = .074), including infection (n = 4), wound dehiscence (n = 1), and/or symptomatic hardware (n = 16) that required hardware removal. All of the minor complications were treated in an outpatient setting under local anesthesia or under intravenous sedation. When the complications were pooled together, the Fisher exact test again yielded no difference in complications between the 3 groups (P = .33).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The use of Erich arch bars or interdental wire fixation to assist with MMF during the open reduction and internal fixation of noncomminuted mandibular angle fractures treated in Champy fashion is not always necessary for successful outcome."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The COVID-19 pandemic has required that specialists use videoconsultation (VC) to maintain continuity of care. As in-person consultations (IPCs) and surgical procedures were cancelled, VC became the tool of choice. No recent French study has assessed VC as the main consultation modality. The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate: 1) patient satisfaction, 2) access to and the future of VC, 3) and the reasons for VC refusal in the setting of the pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Hypothesis:\n        \n      \n      Patients responded favourably to VC.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and method:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a prospective, single-centre, observational study of consecutive patients who were invited to switch from IPC to VC during the lockdown of March 16 to May 11, 2020, when IPCs were not available. All patients were included in the study, regardless of whether they accepted the VC. The reasons for refusal were recorded at the time of the invitation. The surgeons sent the patients who accepted an emailed satisfaction questionnaire after the VC.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 783 patients with scheduled IPCs, 291 (37.2%) accepted a VC instead, 408 (52.1%) refused the VC, and 84 (10.7%) could not be contacted by telephone and were therefore excluded. The VC acceptance rate was 37% (291/783). Of the 291 VC patients, 233 (80.1%) returned the satisfaction questionnaire, although 2 questionnaires had too many missing data to be included, leaving 231 patients for the analysis. The VC was the first consultation with the surgeon for 66 (28.6%) patients. Of the 165 (71.4%) other patients, 51.6% (85/165) were receiving post-operative follow-up. On a 0-5 scale, the global VC experience was scored 4.3±0.8. Of the 231 VC patients, 161 (69.7%) felt that the VC was equivalent to an IPC, 18 (7.8%) that it was poorer, and 7 (3%) that it was better than an IPC; 45 (19.5%) had no opinion on this point. If choosing between a VC or an IPC had been possible during this first lockdown, 168/231 (72.7%) patients would have chosen an IPC. In contrast, 198/231 (85.7%) patients said they would choose an IPC after the lockdown. The group that refused the VC had a significantly older mean age (57.8±16.4 years vs. 48.0±14.4 years, p<0.0001) and lived closer to the institution (p<0.0001), whereas the sex distribution was comparable, with 42.9% of males (175/408) refusing and 46.8% (108/231) accepting the VC (p=0.39). The main reason for refusal was a wish for an in-person encounter with the surgeon (268/408, 65.7%). Patients aged ≥65 years were more likely to refuse due to technical considerations (access to electronic equipment and to the Internet), whereas patients ≤35 years were more likely to wait for an IPC.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The rate of satisfaction with the VC was high. Satisfaction was not significantly associated with the reason for the consultation (joint involved, degenerative or post-traumatic condition, first VC, first consultation, or follow-up before or after surgery). Although most patients who accepted the VC felt that this modality was equivalent to an IPC, many remained desirous of an in-person encounter with the surgeon, notably among the youngest individuals. Outside the setting of a pandemic, the IPC remains the consultation modality of choice for most of our patients.\n    \n\n\n          Level of evidence:\n        \n      \n      V, prospective study without a control group."

Since guidelines are not self-implementing and SSI-preventive compliance is often insufficient, implementation interventions have been developed to promote compliance. This systematic review aims to identify implementation interventions used in abdominal surgery to prevent SSIs and determine associations with SSI reductions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Literature was searched in April 2018 (Medline/PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection). Implementation interventions were classified using the implementation subcategories of the EPOC Taxonomy (Cochrane Review Group Effective Practice and Organisation of Care, EPOC). Additionally, an effectiveness analysis was conducted on the association between the number of implementation interventions, specific compositions thereof, and absolute and relative SSI risk reductions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Forty studies were included. Implementation interventions used most frequently (\"top five\") were audit and feedback (80% of studies), organizational culture (70%), monitoring the performance of healthcare delivery (65%), reminders (53%), and educational meetings (45%). Twenty-nine studies (72.5%) used a multimodal strategy (≥3 interventions). An effectiveness analysis revealed significant absolute and relative SSI risk reductions. E.g., numerically, the largest absolute risk reduction of 10.8% pertained to thirteen studies using 3-5 interventions (p < .001); however, this was from a higher baseline rate than those with fewer or more interventions. The largest relative risk reduction was 52.4% for studies employing the top five interventions, compared to 43.1% for those not including these. Furthermore, neither the differences in risk reduction between studies with different numbers of implementation interventions (bundle size) nor between studies including the top five interventions (vs. not) were significant.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In SSI prevention in abdominal surgery, mostly standard bundles of implementation interventions are applied. While an effectiveness analysis of differences in SSI risk reduction by number and type of interventions did not render conclusive results, use of standard interventions such as audit and feedback, organizational culture, monitoring, reminders, and education at least does not seem to represent preventive malpractice. Further research should determine implementation interventions, or bundles thereof, which are most effective in promoting compliance with SSI-preventive measures in abdominal surgery."

However, whether a single steroid load during surgery has negative effects during the postoperative period has not yet been studied.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effects of a steroid load of dexamethasone on postoperative systemic or wound infection, delayed wound healing, and blood glucose change in adult surgical patients (with planned subgroup analysis of patients with and without diabetes).\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science for relevant articles on 29 January 2018.

We required that studies include a follow-up of 30 days for proper assessment of the number of postoperative infections, delayed wound healing, and the glycaemic response.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data from relevant studies, and assessed all included studies for bias. We resolved differences by discussion and pooled included studies in a meta-analysis. We calculated Peto odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. Our primary outcomes were postoperative systemic or wound infection, delayed wound healing, and glycaemic response within 24 hours. We created a funnel plot for the primary outcome postoperative (wound or systemic) infection. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included in the meta-analysis 37 studies that included adults undergoing a large variety of surgical procedures (i.e. abdominal surgery, cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, and orthopaedic surgery). We excluded one previously included study, as this study was recently retracted. Age range of participants was 18 to 80 years. There is probably little or no difference in the risk of postoperative (wound or systemic) infection with dexamethasone compared with no treatment, placebo, or active control (ramosetron, ondansetron, or tropisetron) (Peto OR 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.27; 4603 participants, 26 studies; I² = 32%; moderate-quality evidence). The effects of dexamethasone on delayed wound healing are unclear because the wide confidence interval includes both meaningful benefit and harm (Peto OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.28 to 3.43; 1072 participants, eight studies; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). Dexamethasone may produce a mild increase in glucose levels among participants without diabetes during the first 12 hours after surgery (MD 13 mg/dL, 95% CI 6 to 21; 10 studies; 595 participants; I² = 50%; low-quality evidence). We identified two studies reporting on glycaemic response after dexamethasone in participants with diabetes within 24 hours after surgery (MD 32 mg/dL, 95% CI 15 to 49; 74 participants; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A single dose of dexamethasone probably does not increase the risk for postoperative infection. It is uncertain whether dexamethasone has an effect on delayed wound healing in the general surgical population owing to imprecision in trial results. Participants with increased risk for delayed wound healing (e.g. participants with diabetes, those taking immunosuppressive drugs) were not included in the randomized studies reporting on delayed wound healing included in this meta-analysis; therefore our findings should be extrapolated to the clinical setting with caution. Furthermore, one has to keep in mind that dexamethasone induces a mild increase in glucose. For patients with diabetes, very limited evidence suggests a more pronounced increase in glucose. Whether this influences wound healing in a clinically relevant way remains to be established. Once assessed, the two studies awaiting classification and three that are ongoing may alter the conclusions of this review."

            "abstract": "Background: Ventral hernia repair (VHR) is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in the United States. Surgical site infections (SSI) carry significant morbidity for the patient and pose a very challenging problem for the surgeon, associated with up to 6.6% of cases. Thus, surgeons should be well versed in the risk factors implicated in SSI after VHR. Given the high burden of diabetes, obesity, and smoking in our patient population, we sought to study the rate of SSI and the risk factors that led to SSI in our population. Study Design: This is a retrospective study using the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) database for the years 2014-2019. We identified patients who underwent VHR at a single institution in the Bronx, New York. The rate of SSI was calculated, and then, risk factors for SSI were identified using logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 3936 patients underwent VHR. Incisional hernias made up 41% of the cohort, and there were 37.4% laparoscopic repairs. During the 30-day follow-up, SSI was identified in 101 patients (2.6%). Factors associated with SSI include emergent surgery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.57), body mass index >35 kg/m2 (aOR = 2.38), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (aOR = 2.36), and incisional hernia (aOR = 1.81). In addition, a laparoscopic approach was found to be a protective factor (aOR = 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.75). Surprisingly, different from other studies, smoking cigarettes was not associated with SSI in our cohort. Conclusions: The rate of SSI after VHR in our institution is 2.6%, which is within that reported in the literature. Most of the variables associated with SSI are modifiable and are similar to those previously reported. Laparoscopic repairs appear to be protective for its occurrence."

Advancements in telecommunication create an opportunity for mobile health (mHealth) tools to support CHWs. We aim to evaluate the use of mHealth technology to aid CHWs in identification of SSIs and promote referral of patients back to healthcare facilities.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Prospective randomised controlled trial conducted at Kirehe District Hospital, Rwanda, from November 2017 to November 2018. Patients ≥18 years who undergo caesarean section are eligible. Non-residents of Kirehe District or patients who remain in hospital >10 days postoperatively will be excluded. Patients will be randomised to one of three arms. For arm 1, a CHW will visit the patient's home on postoperative day 10 (±3 days) to administer an SSI screening protocol (fever, pain or purulent drainage) using an electronic tablet. For arm 2, the CHW will administer the screening protocol over the phone. For both arms 1 and 2, the CHW will refer patients who respond 'yes' to any of the questions to a health facility. For arm 3, patients will not receive follow-up care.

            "abstract": "Bacteria-carrying particles and exhaled anaesthetic gases are the two contaminants found in the air flow patterns of operating rooms. Their origin, direction and speed were illustrated by a motion picture using Schlieren photography and smoke tracers. Compared with a conventionally well air conditioned operating theatre, it was shown that a downward flow of clean air reduced the number of bacteria-carrying particles at the wound site by sixty times. The Exflow method of achieving this without the restriction of any side panels or floor obstruction was described. The total body exhaust worn by the surgical team was shown to reduce the bacteria count by a further eleven times. Clinical results show that when both these systems are used together, patient infection was reduced from 9 per cent to between 0.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent, even when no pre-operative antibiotics were used. Anaesthetic gas pollution was measured and shown to be generally 1000 p.p.m. at the head of the patient, in induction, operating and recovery rooms, also in dental and labour rooms. A high volume low pressure active scavenging system was described together with its various attachments including one specially for paediatric scavenging. Results showed a reduction of nitrous oxide pollution to between zero and 3 p.p.m. The economy and cost effectiveness of both these pollution control systems was shown to be good due to the removal of health hazards from patients and theatre staff."

We used a structured observational method to collect data about infection control practices among surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses, cardiopulmonary bypass technicians and orderlies practising in the cardiac operating theatre during open heart surgery at Mater Dei Hospital. To prevent bias, we did not disclose the actual procedures observed to the surgical team members, but participants knew they were being observed for infection control practices. We measured the 30-day SSI rate by post-discharge telephonic surveillance among surviving open heart surgery patients who had consented to the survey. We observed practices during 30 randomly chosen operations and found higher levels of inadequate practices related to environmental disinfection, hand hygiene, operating room traffic and surgical attire of non-scrubbed personnel (anaesthesiologists and cardiopulmonary bypass technicians). In all, 140 of 155 patients who underwent open heart surgery were followed up, achieving a response rate of 91.5%. Superficial and deep SSI rates were 16.4% and 4.3% respectively, including both sternal and harvest site infections. We found poor compliance with infection control practices by non-scrubbed personnel involved in cardiac surgery and observed a high surgical site infection rate, the majority being leg wound infections following saphenous vein harvesting."

            "abstract": "Given the complexity of the sterilization process, and the risk involved in absence of strict adherence to the protocol described by the medical device manufacturers, terminally sterilized devices are emerging and being promoted in the field of medical practices. The characteristics associated with conventional reprocessing are demanding logistics, costs of delay, operations and adverse events, and unacceptable liability. Demanding logistics were a result of decoupled staff between the operating room and sterilize processing department, understaffed and high-volume processing with an additional burden due to inventory management and inefficient training. Other costs arose from upkeep, delay in operating room, and surgical-site infections. Liability arose from the repeatedly use of an unquantifiable process thus adding uncertainties, limited shelf life of the reprocessed implants, contingency of flash sterilization and introduction of newer technology with higher demand on cleaning performances. In contrast, terminally sterilized single-use devices do not carry any of the aforementioned-characteristics, deeming it to be the simplest solution to the current conundrum. This review serves to provide an evaluation of logistics, costs, and potential adverse effects, both directly and indirectly, associated with current practices in the sterile processing department, and also describes as to how the use of terminally sterilized devices can help circumvent those."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Ventriculo-peritoneal shunts (VPS) are still the mainstay treatment for hydrocephalus in children. It is generally accepted that VPS failure and infection rates are higher for neonates than for older children. We compared our 1-year failure and infection rates in under 3-month-old children compared with older children in our department. Results: We identified 58 children under 3 months of age who underwent VPS insertion between January 2007 and December 2016. They had a 29.3% (17) shunt failure rate over the first year. There were two confirmed shunt infections (3.4%). Discussion: The 1-year shunt failure rate at our institution for VPS insertion in children over 3 months is 26.1% and the infection rate is 4.3% (9). The literature suggests that the outcome for VPS in younger children is worse than for older children. Our work shows similar outcomes for all children compared to those under 3 months at time of VPS insertion alone. Conclusion: Children under 3-months-old undergoing VPS insertion should not automatically expect an increased 1-year failure or infection rate compared with older children. The reasons for this may be as a result of increased subspecialisation, the more widespread use of antibiotic-impregnated catheters and improved neonatal care."

We found 46% of the patients experienced problems post-discharge which led to early contact with a doctor. Infection was identified in 26% and secondary haemorrhage in 11%. Common symptoms associated with the prescribing of antibiotics were sore throat (74%) and secondary haemorrhage (41%). Each GP saw, on average, 2.4 post-tonsillectomy patients per annum. The diagnosis of post-tonsillectomy infection is difficult. This was reflected in the wide variation of clinical features used to diagnose post-tonsillectomy infection by doctors.

Such infections are a particular concern in global health and low-resource areas, where microbial antibiotic resistance is often common. In order to help address this problem, there is a great interest in developing simple tools for early detection of surgical wounds. Motivated by this need, we describe the development of two Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) models designed to detect an infection in a surgical wound using a color image taken from a mobile device. These models were developed using image data collected from a clinical study with 572 women in Rural Rwanda, who underwent Cesarean section surgery and had photos taken approximately 10 days after surgery. Infected wounds (N=62) were diagnosed by a trained doctor through a physical exam. In our model development, we observed a trade-off between AUC accuracy and sensitivity, and we chose to optimize for sensitivity, to match its use as a screening tool. Our naïve CNN model, with a limited number of convolutions and parameters, achieved median AUC = 0.655, true positive rate sensitivity = 0.75, specificity = 0.58, classification accuracy = 0.86. The second CNN model, developed with transfer learning using the Resnet50 architecture, produced a median AUC = 0.639 sensitivity = 0.92, specificity = 0.18, and classification accuracy 0.82. We discuss the specific training and optimization methods used to compensate for significant class imbalance and maximize sensitivity."

The diameter of the leg pre and postoperatively, as well as the incidence, type and severity of wound complications were documented for further statistical analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 103 patients were included in this study. Two patients died perioperatively and were excluded from the study. The remaining 101 patients were separated in two cohorts-U/S group (n=32) and blind technique group (n=69). Demographics were similar between the groups, whilst other risk factors for harvest complications, such as presence of superficial varicosities on clinical examination and renal failure were significantly more frequent in the U/S group. The median harvest time was significantly lower within the U/S group (25 mins versus 40 mins; p=0.001), as was the rate of overall wound complications (6.2% vs 23.2%; p=0.04).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Ultrasound assessment of the LSV by the surgical team intraoperatively is feasible, easy to learn and does not demand extra costs or delays. It significantly reduces surgical harvest time and it is associated with a reduced incidence of wound complications, swelling and postoperative mobility impairment."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Despite tremendous efforts, the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) following the surgical treatment of pediatric spinal deformity remains a concern. Although previous studies have reported some risk factors for SSI, these studies have been limited by not being able to investigate multiple risk factors at the same time. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a wide range of preoperative and intraoperative factors in predicting SSI and to develop and validate a prediction model that quantifies the risk of SSI for individual pediatric spinal deformity patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Pediatric patients with spinal deformity who underwent primary, revision, or definitive spinal fusion at 1 of 7 institutions were included. Candidate predictors were known preoperatively and were not modifiable in most cases; these included 31 patient, 12 surgical, and 4 hospital factors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of SSI within 90 days of surgery was utilized. Following multiple imputation and multicollinearity testing, predictor selection was conducted with use of logistic regression to develop multiple models. The data set was randomly split into training and testing sets, and fivefold cross-validation was performed to compare discrimination, calibration, and overfitting of each model and to determine the final model. A risk probability calculator and a mobile device application were developed from the model in order to calculate the probability of SSI in individual patients.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 3,092 spinal deformity surgeries were included, in which there were 132 cases of SSI (4.3%). The final model achieved adequate discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.76), as well as calibration and no overfitting. Predictors included in the model were nonambulatory status, neuromuscular etiology, pelvic instrumentation, procedure time ≥7 hours, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade >2, revision procedure, hospital spine surgical cases <100/year, abnormal hemoglobin level, and overweight or obese body mass index.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The risk probability calculator encompassing patient, surgical, and hospital factors developed in the present study predicts the probability of 90-day SSI in pediatric spinal deformity surgery. This validated calculator can be utilized to improve informed consent and shared decision-making and may allow the deployment of additional resources and strategies selectively in high-risk patients.\n    \n\n\n          Level of evidence:\n        \n      \n      Prognostic Level III.

            "abstract": "In the 1990's there were concerns that methotrexate might increase the risk of post operative complications following elective orthopaedic surgery; as a result many Units initiated policies to discontinue methotrexate prior to elective orthopaedic surgery. In 2001 we carried out a controlled study of complications after elective surgery in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who either continued or discontinued methotrexate prior to surgery. In this study we showed that continuation of methotrexate therapy prior to orthopaedic surgery did not increase the risk of infection or surgical complication occurring in patients with RA within one year of surgery. The limitation of this study was that complications later than one year were not studied. Sixty-five patients have been followed up. Thirty-one were fully assessed in clinic and 34 underwent a structured telephone interview. There were no incidences of deep bone infection in any patient group so that there is no evidence that continued methotrexate therapy in the perioperative period increases the risk of late deep infections. We adhere to our original advice that in the absence of renal failure or sepsis, methotrexate therapy should not be stopped before elective orthopaedic surgery in patients with RA whose disease is controlled by the drug before surgery."

The combination of technical and adaptive elements represents a promising approach to facilitate the introduction of evidence-based best practices and to improve safety culture through local team engagement in resource-limited settings."

They mostly cause nosocomial infections associated with surgical procedures. This case study is the first report of a Raoultella infection in Africa. Case presentation We report a case of a surgical site infection (SSI) caused by Raoultella planticola which developed after caesarean section (CS) and surgery for secondary small bowel obstruction. The patient became febrile with neutrophilia (19,157/µL) 4 days after laparotomy and started to develop clinical signs of a SSI on the 8th day after laparotomy. The patient continued to be febrile and became critically ill despite empirical treatment with ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Raoultella species with extended antimicrobial resistance (AMR) carrying the CTX-M-9 β-lactamase was isolated from the wound discharge. Considering the antimicrobial susceptibility test, ceftriaxone was replaced by ceftazidime. The patient recovered and could be discharged on day 29 after CS.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Raoultella planticola was isolated from an infected surgical site after repeated abdominal surgery. Due to the infection the patient's stay in the hospital was prolonged for a total of 4 weeks. It is noted that patients undergoing surgical and prolonged inpatient treatment are at risk for infections caused by Raoultella. The development of a SSI caused by Raoultella planticola with extended AMR has to be assumed to be a consequence of ineffective antibiotic utilization. The presented case advices that rare bacteria as Raoultella should be considered as potential cause of nosocomial SSI with challenging treatment due to high levels of AMR."

Surveillance is an important method for controlling SSI but it is unclear how this can best be performed in low-income settings.\n## AIM\nTo examine the epidemiological characteristics of various components of an SSI surveillance programme in a single Kenyan hospital.\n## METHODS\nThe study assessed the inter-observer consistency of the surgical wound class (SWC) and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores using the kappa statistic. Post-discharge telephone calls were evaluated against an outpatient clinician review 'gold standard'. The predictive value of components of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC-NHNS) risk index was examined in patients having major obstetric or gynaecological surgery (O&G) between August 2010 and February 2011.\n## FINDINGS\nAfter appropriate training, surgeons and anaesthetists were found to be consistent in their use of the SWC and ASA scores respectively. Telephone calls were found to have a sensitivity of 70% [95% confidence interval (CI): 47-87] and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 95-100) for detection of post-discharge SSI in this setting. In 954 patients undergoing major O&G operations, the SWC score was the only parameter in the CDC-NHNS risk index model associated with the risk of SSI (odds ratio: 4.00; 95% CI: 1.21-13.2; P = 0.02).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nSurveillance for SSI can be conducted in a low-income hospital setting, although dedicated staff, intensive training and local modifications to surveillance methods are necessary. Surveillance for post-discharge SSI using telephone calls is imperfect but provides a practical alternative to clinic-based diagnosis. The SWC score was the only predictor of SSI risk in O&G surgery in this context.\n"

A publicly funded single health care payer perspective was adopted across a lifetime horizon.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      This study was conducted using in-hospital elective colorectal surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Patients:\n        \n      \n      The base case was an age-, sex-, and comorbidity-standardized patient undergoing open elective colorectal surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Intervention:\n        \n      \n      Negative pressure wound therapy was applied postoperatively over closed incisions.\n    \n\n\n          Main outcomes:\n        \n      \n      The primary outcomes of interest were the number of surgical site infections, total costs, and quality-adjusted life-years gained. Secondary outcomes included emergency department presentation, hospital readmission, nursing wound care utilization, fascial dehiscence, incisional hernia, and non-surgical site infection-related complications.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We found that prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy, standardized to 1000 patients, prevented 51 surgical site infections, 3 fascial dehiscences, 10 incisional hernias, 22 emergency department presentations, and 6 hospital readmissions. This resulted in a total cost saving of $17,066 and 92.2 quality-adjusted life-years gained ($17.07 and 0.09 quality-adjusted life-years gained on average per patient). When the patients' risk of surgical site infections was greater than 3.2%, negative pressure wound therapy was a cost-effective strategy at a willingness to pay of $50,000/quality-adjusted life-years.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      We did not model for societal perspective, emergent presentations of incarcerated hernias, or complications with hernia repair. The results of this model are reliant on the published negative pressure wound therapy efficacy and may change when additional data arise.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The use of negative pressure wound therapy is the dominant strategy with improved outcomes and reduced costs compared with conventional dressing in patients undergoing colorectal surgery, particularly in at-risk patients.

Anteriormente se demostró que la terapia profiláctica con presión negativa reduce la infección del sitio quirúrgico en comparación con los apósitos convencionales. Sin embargo, el uso de la terapia de presión negativa se encuentra en dudas debido a su costo adicional.OBJETIVO:Determinar si la aplicación de la terapia profiláctic con presión negativa después de la cirugía colorrectal electiva es rentable.DISEÑO:Se completó un análisis de costo-efectividad comparando la terapia profiláctica con presión negativa versus apósito convencional utilizando un modelo de microsimulación de Markov. Se adoptó una perspectiva de pagador único de asistencia sanitaria financiada con fondos públicos a lo largo de toda la vida.AJUSTE:Cirugía colorrectal electiva intrahospitalaria.PACIENTES:El caso base fue un paciente estandarizado por edad, sexo y comorbilidad sometido a cirugía colorrectal abierta electiva.INTERVENCIÓN:Aplicación postoperatoria de terapia de presión negativa sobre incisiones cerradas.RESULTADOS PRINCIPALES:Los resultados primarios de interés fueron el número de infecciones del sitio quirúrgico, los costos totales y los años de vida ganados ajustados por calidad. Los resultados secundarios incluyeron presentación en la sala de emergencias, reingreso al hospital, la utilización del cuidado de heridas por enfermería, dehiscencia fascial, hernia incisional y complicaciones relacionadas con infecciones del sitio no quirúrgico.RESULTADOS:Estandarizado para 1,000 pacientes, encontramos que la terapia profiláctica con presión negativa previno 51 infecciones del sitio quirúrgico, 3 dehiscencias fasciales, 10 hernias incisionales, 22 presentaciones en la sala de emergencias y 6 reingresos al hospital. Esto resultó en un ahorro total de costos de $ 17.066 y 92.2 años de vida ganados ajustados por calidad ($ 17.07 y 0.09 años de vida ganados ajustados por calidad en promedio por paciente). Cuando el riesgo de infección del sitio quirúrgico de los pacientes era superior al 3,2%, la terapia de presión negativa era una estrategia rentable con una disposición a pagar de 50.000 dólares por años de vida ajustados por calidad.LIMITACIONES:No modelamos para la perspectiva social, presentaciones emergentes de hernias encarceladas o complicaciones con la reparación de hernias. Los resultados de este modelo dependen de la eficacia publicada de la terapia de presión negativa y pueden cambiar cuando surjan más datos.CONCLUSIONES:El uso de la terapia de presión negativa es la estrategia dominante con mejores resultados y costos reducidos en comparación con el apósito convencional en pacientes sometidos a cirugía colorrectal, particularmente en pacientes de riesgo.

VMMC is a surgical procedure and some adverse events (AEs) are expected. Swaziland's Ministry of Health established a toll-free hotline to provide general information about VMMC and to manage post-operative clinical AEs through telephone triage.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We retrospectively analyzed a dataset of telephone calls logged by the VMMC hotline during a VMMC campaign. The objectives were to determine reasons clients called the VMMC hotline and to ascertain the accuracy of telephone-based triage for VMMC AEs. We then analyzed VMMC service delivery data that included date of surgery, AE type and severity, as diagnosed by a VMMC clinician as part of routine post-operative follow-up. Both datasets were de-identified and did not contain any personal identifiers. Proportions of AEs were calculated from the call data and from VMMC service delivery data recorded by health facilities. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the accuracy of phone-based triage compared to clinically confirmed AEs.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 17,059 calls were registered by the triage nurses from April to December 2011. Calls requesting VMMC education and counseling totaled 12,492 (73.2%) and were most common. Triage nurses diagnosed 384 clients with 420 (2.5%) AEs. According to the predefined clinical algorithms, all moderate and severe AEs (153) diagnosed through telephone-triage were referred for clinical management at a health facility. Clinicians at the VMMC sites diagnosed 341 (4.1%) total clients as having a mild (46.0%), moderate (47.8%), or severe (6.2%) AE. Eighty-nine (26%) of the 341 clients who were diagnosed with AEs by clinicians at a VMMC site had initially called the VMMC hotline. The telephone-based triage system had a sensitivity of 69%, a positive predictive value of 83%, and a negative predictive value of 48% for screening moderate or severe AEs of all the AEs.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The use of a telephone-based triage system may be an appropriate first step to identify life-threatening and urgent complications following VMMC surgery."

The COVID-19 pandemic led to telehealth replacing face-to-face care for many surgical consultations across a variety of situations. More evidence is needed regarding patient perceptions of telehealth in surgery, in particular, exploring barriers and facilitators associated with its sustained implementation beyond the pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Survey invitations were emailed to a convenience sample of surgical patients by their surgeon following a telehealth consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surgeons were recruited from a sample (n = 683) who completed a survey on telehealth (distributed via email to all Australian Fellows of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons). Mixed methods analysis was performed of the patient survey data.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 1166 consultations were captured: 50% routine reviews, 17% initial appointments and 20% post-operative reviews. Video-link was used in 49% of consultations. The majority of patients (94%), were satisfied with the quality of their surgical telehealth consultation and 75% felt it delivered the same level of care as face-to-face encounters. Telehealth was convenient to use (96%) and led to cost savings for 60% of patients. When asked about future appointment preferences after the pandemic, 41% indicated they would prefer telehealth (24% video-link and 17% telephone) over face-to-face appointments. There was a perception by patients that telehealth consultation fees should be less than face-to-face consultation fees.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Patient satisfaction with surgical telehealth consultations is high.

Rwanda relies on a robust community health worker (CHW)-led, home-based paradigm for delivering follow-up care for women after childbirth. However, this program does not currently include postoperative care for women after c-section, such as SSI screenings.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This trial assesses whether CHW's use of a mobile health (mHealth)-facilitated checklist administered in person or via phone call improved rates of return to care among women who develop an SSI following c-section at a rural Rwandan district hospital.

We hypothesise that the use of TCS for abdominal wound closure may reduce the risk of AWD. Current randomised controlled trials (RCTs) lack power to investigate this. Therefore, the purpose of this individual participant data meta-analysis is to evaluate the effect of TCS for abdominal wound closure on the incidence of AWD.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We will conduct a systematic review of Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for RCTs investigating the effect of TCS compared with non-coated sutures for abdominal wound closure in adult participants scheduled for open abdominal surgery.

Patients were randomised (1:1) to routine postoperative care or additional access to a smartphone-delivered wound assessment tool for 30-days postoperatively. Patient-reported SSI symptoms and wound photographs were requested on postoperative days 3, 7, and 15. The primary outcome was time-to-diagnosis of SSI (Centers for Disease Control definition). 492 patients were randomised (smartphone intervention: 223; routine care: 269).

The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has suddenly resurrected a new pillar in oncology care: teleoncology. With oncologists reaching out to patients through telemedicine, it is possible to evaluate and fulfill patients' needs; triage patients for elective procedures; screen them for influenza-like illness; provide them with guidance for hospital visits, if needed; and bridge oral medications and treatments when a hospital visit is not desirable because of any high risk-benefit ratio. Teleoncology can bring great reassurance to patients at times when reaching an oncology center is challenging, and more so in resource-constrained countries. Evidence-based treatment protocols, dispensable by teleoncology, already exist for many sites of cancer and they can provide a bridge to treatment when patients are unable to reach cancer centers for their standard treatment.

            "abstract": "We report the case of a patient with postoperative, hospital-acquired, quadruple-valve endocarditis caused by Enterococcus faecalis on presumed normal native valves. During a cervical laminectomy, the patient had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction that was treated conservatively. In the intensive care unit, the patient became febrile and developed a new 2/6 systolic murmur. Blood cultures grew E. faecalis, and the patient was given antibiotics. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography revealed vegetations on all 4 heart valves. Subsequently, the patient was moved to another facility and died. No autopsy was performed. E. faecalis is the third-most-common cause of bacterial endocarditis overall; however, it is rarely found in multiple-valve, hospital-acquired endocarditis. Although transthoracic echocardiography is a powerful diagnostic tool, transesophageal echocardiography increases the sensitivity and specificity to about 90%. In our patient, the diagnosis of native quadruple-valve endocarditis would not have not been made without the use of transesophageal echocardiography."

Living in a \"surgical care desert\" results in a delay in care, driving up health care costs and reducing quality of care. In the age of COVID-19, patient access to health care has been further diminished by physical distancing guidelines, naturally increasing the need for innovative telehealth solutions. In this review, we focus on using smartphones for mobile health technology (mHealth) in the delivery of surgical care. This study is aimed at a general surgical audience that may be interested in exploring how mHealth can improve both access and health care quality for surgical patients and their families. We review the current uses of mHealth by surgeons for surgical site infection, new models of the perioperative surgical home, acute care surgical triage, remote patient monitoring devices, and evaluation and management of surgical consultations in the patient's home. We also review institutional and governmental barriers to the adoption of mHealth and offer some preliminary solutions that may aid the surgeon who wishes to implement this technology in their day-to-day practice."

DESIGN Observation and sampling study. SETTING Academic health center, public hospital. METHODS We first analyzed 27 videotaped procedures to determine the areas in the OR with high and low numbers of people in transit. We then placed air samplers and settle plates in representative locations during 21 procedures in 4 different ORs during 2 different seasons of the year to measure microbial load in colony-forming units (CFU). The temperature and humidity, number of door openings, physical movement, and the number of people in the OR were measured for each procedure. Statistical analysis was conducted using hierarchical regression. RESULTS The microbial load was affected by the time of year that the samples were taken. Both microbial load measured by the air samplers and by settle plates in 1 area of the OR was correlated with the physical movement of people in the same area but not with the number of door openings and the number of people in the OR. CONCLUSIONS Movement in the OR is correlated with the microbial load. Establishing operational guidelines or developing OR layouts that focus on minimizing movement by incorporating desirable internal storage points and workstations can potentially reduce microbial load, thereby potentially reducing surgical site infection risk.

The goal of this study was to survey the neurosurgical community and determine the most frequent EVD insertion practices. The hypothesis was that there would be no standard practices identified for EVD insertion or methods to avoid EVD-associated infections. METHODS The American Association of Neurological Surgeons membership database was queried for all eligible neurosurgeons. A 16-question, multiple-choice format survey was created and sent to 7217 recipients. The responses were collected electronically, and the descriptive results were tabulated. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test. RESULTS In total, 1143 respondents (15.8%) completed the survey, and 705 respondents (61.6%) reported tracking EVD infections at their institution. The most common self-reported infection rate ranged from 1% to 3% (56.1% of participants), and 19.7% of respondents reported a 0% infection rate. In total, 451 respondents (42.7%) indicated that their institution utilizes a formal protocol for EVD placement. If a respondent's institution had a protocol, only 258 respondents (36.1%) always complied with the protocol. Protocol utilization for EVD insertion was significantly more frequent among residents, in academic/hybrid centers, in ICU settings, and if the institution tracked EVD-associated infection rates (p < 0.05). A self-reported 0% infection rate was significantly more commonly associated with a higher level of training (e.g., attending physicians), private center settings, a clinician performing 6 to 10 EVD insertions within the previous 12 months, and prophylactic continuous antibiotic utilization (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS This survey demonstrated heterogeneity in the practices for EVD insertion. No standard practices have been proposed or adopted by the neurosurgical community for EVD insertion or complication avoidance. These results highlight the need for the nationwide standardization of technique and complication prevention measures."

The competence and technique of the surgeon is considered important in preventing SSI. We have reviewed the evidence on different aspects of surgical technique and its role in preventing SSI. The most recent guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK recommend avoiding diathermy for skin incision even though this reduces incision time and blood loss, both associated with lower infection rates. Studies comparing different closure techniques, i.e. continuous versus interrupted sutures, have not found a statistically significant difference in the SSI rate, but using continuous sutures is quicker. For contaminated wounds, the surgical site should be left open for four days to allow for treatment of local infection before subsequent healing by primary intention. Surgical drains should be placed through separate incisions, closed suction drains are preferable to open drains, and all drains should be removed as soon as possible. There are relatively few large studies on the impact of surgical techniques on SSI rates. Larger multicentre prospective studies are required to define what aspects of surgical technique impact on SSI, to better inform surgical practice and support education programmes for surgical trainees."

The results of the independent team were compared with the outcomes provided by two registration systems for SSI, so as to evaluate the reliability of these systems as a possible alternative for indicating quality of care.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study was an incidence study conducted from May 2007 to January 2009 that included 1,000 adult patients scheduled to undergo open abdominal surgery in an academic teaching hospital. Surgical incisions were inspected daily to check for SSI according to definitions of health care-associated infections established by the CDC. Follow-up after discharge was done at the outpatient clinic of the hospital by telephone or letter in combination with patient diaries and reviews of patient charts, discharge letters, electronic files, and reported complications. Univariate and multivariable analyses were done to identify putative risk factors for missing registrations.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 1,000 patients in the study, 33 were not evaluated. Surgical site infections were diagnosed in 26.8% of the 967 remaining patients, of which 18.0% were superficial incisional infections, 5.4% were deep incisional infections, and 3.4% were organ/space infections. More than 60% of SSIs were unreported in either of the department's two tracking systems for such infections. For these two systems, independent major risk factors for missing registrations were (1) the lack of occurrence of an SSI, (2) transplantation surgery, and (3) admission to non-surgical departments.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Most SSIs were not tracked with the department's two systems. These systems proved poor alternatives to the gold-standard method of quantifying the incidence of Surgical Site Infection SSI and, therefore, the quality of care. Both protocolized wound assessment and on-site documentation are mandatory for realistic quantification of the incidence of SSI."

The methods used for following up 667 patients undergoing one of five representative surgical procedures are described. Emergency, elective and day-case procedures are included. A combination of healthcare worker questionnaire, telephone calls and patient questionnaire gave a follow-up rate of 92.7%. The system took infection control staff an average of 40 min per patient (30 min inpatient assessment, 10 min post-discharge).

Abdominal hernia was defined to include ventral and incisional hernias, and other types were excluded. The presence or absence of a pregnancy following primary hernia repair was elucidated from the database. Subjects were excluded if a hernia repair occurred during pregnancy. The rate of hernia recurrence, defined as reoperation, was calculated. The association between pregnancy and hernia recurrence was evaluated with logistic regression, both unadjusted and adjusted for diabetes, obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m(2)), tobacco abuse, and wound complication at the time of initial hernia repair.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 11,020 women with a history of hernia repair were identified, of whom 840 had a subsequent pregnancy.

Women with a history of pregnancy following primary hernia repair were more likely to have a body mass index >30 kg/m(2), a history of tobacco abuse, and a wound complication at the time of primary repair. In an unadjusted analysis, pregnancy was associated with an increase in the risk of hernia recurrence (13.1% vs 7.1%, odds ratio, 1.96, 95% confidence interval, 1.60-2.42). The association between pregnancy and hernia recurrence was attenuated but persisted after adjusting for confounding factors (adjusted odds ratio, 1.73, 95% confidence interval, 1.40-2.14).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of abdominal hernia recurrence after adjusting for confounding factors. The magnitude of this association is likely underestimated, given that the risk of recurrence was defined as reoperation, which captures only the most clinically significant group of recurrences. This information will facilitate counseling for reproductive-aged women planning elective ventral or incisional hernia repair. The risk of recurrence and subsequent reoperation should be balanced against the risk of incarceration and emergent surgery during pregnancy. As such, the desire for future pregnancy and/or contraception should be considered when planning asymptomatic hernia repair for women of reproductive age."
